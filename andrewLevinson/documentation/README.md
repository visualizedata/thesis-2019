Freshwater has been described as the oil of the 21st century. In the wake of extreme water stress events across the globe in places like Cape Town, Mexico City, and Australia, I wanted to explore often overlooked water issues here at home in the United States. Major factors like population growth and climate change are causing local pockets of water stress that will soon affect other areas of the country without action. In order to change our relationship with water, action must come in the form of both infrastructure investments and behavioral changes.
