  "Abate_Mary_timecode.txt": "00:00:03 Queens Memory interview with Mary Abbate at the Queens Community House at 108-25 62nd Drive in Forest Hills. Mary is the Associate Executive Director. It is August 6, 2018 at 1:55 PM. 00:00:46 Mary was born on June 9, 1961 at the Kew Gardens Hospital which no long exists. 00:01:03 Mary’s mother was raised on the Upper East Side, in East Harlem, an Italian American Community. Her father was raised in Brooklyn. 00:01:21 Her grandparents arrived in New York in the early 19th century, from Italy. Her mother’s side was from Bari, Italy. Her father’s side was from Sicily. Mary knows more about her mother’s side as she lived with her maternal grandparents and visited a lot with her extended family. Family members came to the house every week. 00:01:56 Her paternal grandfather died before Mary was born and her paternal grandmother died when Mary was young. There was less story telling about them. Her father’s story was about growing up. But she heard stories about her maternal grandmother growing up in Italy. These stories were about letting go. When you left Italy, you left. Why would you want to go back? 00:03:00 Mary’s parents met in their late teens/early 20’s at a church dance. They got married. Her grandmother moved from an apartment building in Manhattan to Queens where there was space. Her grandfather had a factory which produced goods for the airlines, but he lost his business during the depression. Her grandmother saw a lot of construction on the Upper East Side, bought a deli, and learned to cook food for the community – primarily German and Hungarian - and kept the family going. 00:04:36 Her grandmother followed her oldest daughter to Astoria and eventually bought a small apartment building there. Mary’s other aunt and uncle moved in when they got married. Mary’s parents also moved in. They all had their own apartments and paid rent to the grandmother. 00:05:46 In the late 1950’s, everyone started moving further out in Queens to more suburban/rural parts. Her aunt was in Bayside. Her other aunt and uncle moved to Auburndale. Her parents moved to a two-family house in Flushing and her grandparents moved in with them (171st off Northern Blvd). Mary was born there. Mary’s background is Roman Catholic. 00:07:38 Mary grew up in Flushing. Her family moved to 43-32 167th Street, a big Tudor house, with her parents and grandparents. Mary then described the living arrangements. It was a suburban setting, with lawns and suburban houses. The children played on the street and there were gangs in the school yard. It was an ethnic neighborhood with Italians, Germans, Irish, Jews, Puerto Ricans, and an Armenian family next door. There was an American family across the street that could trace it history very far back and they were admired. Mary’s family was loud, and everything was cooked with tomato sauce on it! Her best friend lived across the street and was from Puerto Rico. 00:11:15 The children played on the street at night. Before air conditioning, on hot nights, they would sit on the stoop. Their neighbors’ property was their playground, they were out until 11PM on Saturday nights. Her grandmother was the guardian of the block. 00:12:10 Mary would take neighborhood walks with her grandparents. Her grandmother was friends with the Chinese owner of laundromat. She would stop to talk with another older person, who was also Chinese. They both had broken English. Her grandmother spoke an Italian dialect. They had a bond because of their age. 00:13:48 Mary went to the UA Quartet Movie Theatre. It was 75 cents for a double feature. Her first date was there when she was 13 years old. 00:14:35 Mary remembers the Copper Penny (a diner) and the first time she had pancakes. There was a Chinese restaurant. That was very exotic. The family ate there once a month. 00:15:41 Mary went to PS 107 for kindergarten. From first to eighth grade (late 60’s, early 70’s), she went to a Catholic School, St. Andrew Avellino, which was a big community. She followed her brother, who was a great student. Mary was told by teachers that she was not her brother. She questioned things, but she was a good student. The school was in Flushing, at Northern Blvd. and 158th Street (35-60 158th Street, Flushing). Her parents were very involved in the school. 00:17:11 At the time, people were very engaged in their community and were Church goers. Her parents were very involved in the school. Her father was a coach for CYO and her mother was in the Rosary Society that raised money for the school. It was a very close community. Mary’s friends came from that school. Her friends on the block were weekend friends, these were her school friends. Mary was very influenced by Catholicism. Her parents canvassed for politicians and bowled. 00:19:09 At the time, the Catholic Church (1970’s) was open to exploration of other religions and there were interfaith activities. Mary was very interested in other religions. Her father had grown up in Williamsburg and had a lot of Jewish friends that influenced him about education. Her parents would later, through clubs and other experiences, be exposed to diversity, beyond the Italian community. This also happened as Mary and her brother began dating outside the Italian community. 00:21:40 (1970’s) Mary went to Catholic high school, the Mary Louis Academy (Jamaica, Queens). Mary talked about distancing herself from, and questioning, the Catholic Church. She talked about volunteering in the mental health area. Later, as an adult, she understood the need for institutional religion, community and ritual, and does miss that. She feels that communities are more alienated now – her family is not part of strong organizations. Her daughter might be missing out because of that. 00:24:58 Mary went to Union College in Schenectady, NY. She was not following the Catholic path any more. Her college friend, Ruth Schick, was one of her biggest influencers in college. She exposed Mary to the world of literature and art. Mary’s parents worked two jobs to send the children to private school and college, so Mary felt that if she needed anything extra, she should work. She worked as a waitress at a fraternity, in the school pizzeria, and in the school kitchen. This exposed Mary a bit to the world. She met people of color and people of other classes. She recognized her deficits - that her parents did not go to college. But when she was in the kitchen, she saw how much she had compared to the other workers. It was an eye opener. 00:30:04 (1970’s early 1980’s) When Mary graduated college she wanted to stay in Schenectady. Her friend Ruth was there, and Mary enjoyed the outdoors. She wanted to live there independently. She worked for a year and eventually got a job in a supportive housing environment . She worked there for two years. She then decided she needed to come back to New York. She missed New York and Ruth was leaving Schenectady. Mary needed to continue her education and come back to New York to pursue a social work career and be in an urban environment. 00:33:04 Mary moved in with her parents, who had moved to a condo in Oakland Gardens, Queens. She went to graduate school at Hunter College. She paid for it herself – it was the path to where she is today. 00:33:55 (1980’s) During her second year at Hunter, Mary interned at the Forest Hills Community House (now Queens Community House). Mary was interested in housing and urban planning. She chose social work at Hunter because it had a community organizing-planning track. She wanted to work in an urban setting. The Forest Hills Community House had a housing and homelessness prevention opportunity placement. Her first-year placement was in Manhattan, but it was a very long commute to Queens. She met the Associate Executive Director at the time, Irma Rodriquez, who is well known in the field of social work and housing. She was a very open, friendly, nurturing person. Mary started in 1986 and never left. 00:37:10 Queens Community House is settlement house. It is multi-service, multi-contact, community minded, working with people’s strengths. Mary’s position constantly changed and evolved and her life, as a Queens person, revolved around the Community House. Mary met her husband through a colleague. 00:38:51 Mary started as a student intern doing tenant organizing and counseling. When hired, she started new programs including the Queens Child Care Network and a program to help homeless families find housing. Over time her responsibilities expanded. In 1991 she created the Eviction Prevent Unit and 1996 she took on supervision of the Early Childhood Center In 2000, the Community House absorbed an adult education program that another organization was letting go of, and the organization took over the Pomonok Center in 2006, Mary oversaw the community organizing and food access work there. 00:41:10 The 2008 recession hit the Community House hard. They lost significant funding, including for administrative costs. When the person in charge of seniors retired, the new Executive Director, (Ben Thomases), restructured, and senior services fell under Mary. Now the Community House has two departments: Youth Services and Senior/Community Services which are close in budgetary size. 00:43:12 When Mary started working at Forest Hills Community House, the housing work focused on coop conversions. In the 1980’s, even though Forest Hills was very middle class, the coop conversions were devasting. A lot of rent stabilized units were lost. Working class people and seniors lost their homes because of eviction plans. Forest Hills Community House advocated for non-eviction plans, but a lot of units were lost, and a lot people were displaced. 00:45:46 Mary is still engaged with homelessness and eviction prevention intervention. In the 1990’s, the Community House was engaged mostly with the Black and Latino population with legal status. Since 2008, everyone is dealing with homelessness: immigrant households of a variety of ethnicities and older adults. The lack of affordability is severe. 00:47:13 Forest Hills Community House was established with the Forest Hills Cooperatives to serve the residents moving to the public housing complex and to connect them to larger community. They very quickly moved beyond Forest Hills, expanding to run both the Rego Park Senior Center in Lost Battalion Hall and school-based, after-school programs in Briarwood. The eviction prevention unit was in South East Queens and the Rockaways. The Queens Child Care Network moved to Corona, Elmhurst, Woodhaven and recently to Flushing and Bayside. 00:49:20 For the future, the Community House is structuring around the settlement house model – being embedded in the community - cradle to grave, multi-generational. It offers comprehensive youth services - you can come to the community house as a young person, and be sustainable through education or employment, with a sense of purpose, value, and competency, through all age groups. When you are 18-21, you have the work skills, knowledge, support system, and leadership skills to contribute back to the community. You are the future, with leadership and ownership of the community. 00:52:14 Mary moved to Fresh Meadows in 2006. Before that, she lived (1986-2006) in Oakland Gardens, in the Windsor Park apartments. When she was pregnant, she wanted to be close to both her parents who would care for her daughter (her parents had retired) and a good school (PS 205Q). Her husband was originally from Manhattan and thought Queens would be too quiet. Mary’s husband now loves the quiet and is a Queens person. 00:53:47 In 2006, Mary’s parents were thinking about assisted living, but her mother was not sure, and she wanted to be close to her grand-daughter. They decided to look for a two-family home. That was how Mary had grown up, in a multi-generational household. One day on a bike ride, Mary saw a huge house with a for-sale sign in Fresh Meadows. It had 5 bedrooms, 4 baths, a first-floor bedroom with a back entrance and bathroom, which would be great for her parents They bought the house (75-20 195th Street) in 2006 and Mary’s family and her parents moved in. They had separate living areas and shared the kitchen. 00:56:12 The house is near Cunningham Park. They had to be near a park – before that her mom lived near Ally Pond Park. Her mother was a walker and needed to be near the park. There was also a bocce ball court. Mary’s daughter could stay in the same junior high school. Her husband does not drive. He needed to be near public transportation. He now takes the local bus to the E train. He works for WNET in Manhattan. When he worked in the South Bronx, he took the express bus to the 6 train. 00:58:00 Mary did not want her daughter to go to Jamaica High School, the zoned school, and she was lucky and got into Cardoza High School, through a dance program. She could get there easily on a bus, but Mary drove her. Mary is a driver, as was her mother. This was important to her mother, because driving leads to independence. 1:00:12 Mary gets around by car and bicycle. She rides her bicycle to work along Jewel Avenue or through Flushing Meadows Park. She thinks about Helen Ho, another Queens’ resident, who is an advocate for biking. 1:01:06 Fresh Meadows is mostly single-family houses. There is a multiple block radius of similar homes, established between 1940-45. There are a lot of gardens and green space. The neighborhood includes Cunningham Park and 73rd Avenue. It is very pretty. Cunningham Park is the park for Jamaica and Queens Village. It has concerts, picnics, fireworks, and a wonderful community spirit. 01:02:27 Fresh Meadows is a very diverse community. Mary has neighbors from Uzbekistan, Israel, China, and throughout Asia. It feels like Queens. 01:03:11 There are apartment buildings that are very historic. They were built by major architect in the 1950’s, in art deco style, near 188th Street. 01:04:55 Long Island City development scares Mary, but change is inevitable. Her daughter thinks apartment buildings are more sustainable, but Mary thinks the open space and back yards, where kids play is still important. She hopes Queens can remain grounded. Her neighbors have similar and simple lifestyles – raising kids, going to work, talking to each other and looking out for each other. Mary is not close to her neighbors, but they are friendly and work together on issues/problems. Dogs and kids bring people together. 01:09:38 Queens always had religious freedom and diversity. It is what Americana should be. The United Nations was here, and the airports are here. She wants it to continue this way, where people can feel they belong here, thrive here, go to school here. Mary then told a story about her daughter who went to college for two years at Tulane but felt like a stranger. She could not find people who represented her friends from her public high school in Queens. Her friends were every color, race and ethnicity. There was also little class diversity at college. Her daughter does not feel comfortable any place else. 01:13:52 Mary’s daughter is working at Queensboro Community College and hanging out with her friends. She sees the world even differently than Mary. Although Mary’s social network is inclusive. Mary still contends with identifying people first by their appearance, such as race. Mary still has to push back on the racist influences abundant in her childhood. However, Mary finds solace in her borough and city. Few places offer her what Queens can. Not many places are as comfortable as “home” is. When away, especially if traveling in the States, She misses the colors, the flavors, the diversity that Queens offers. If a place is too white, she feels that it is not right, that she is losing out. Her daughter sees it is not home unless diversity of people surrounds her. 01:16:14 Mary’s hope for Queens is that the next generation is globally comfortable-meaning diversity is appreciated and valued; that difference of race, ethnicity, creed, life style, and gender identity is as common and accepted as the variety found in flora. She hopes her daughter and her friends make new traditions and share rituals. 01:17:41 End of the interview with Mary Abbate at the Queens Community House, at 108-25 62nd Drive in Forest Hills. It is August 6, 2018 at 3:10 PM. ",

She left Nigeria at a very young age with her parents. She noticed that there was a lack of a system in Nigeria. She moved to Queens in 2009. She switched while in middle school. 00:02:45 � She felt alone in Jamaica at first. But, she found that a lot of her neighbors were kids of immigrants. She was able to get friends as time went by. 00:04:15 � Her favorite memory was a school trip to a farmer�s market. Hikmah didn�t know the difference between organic and nonorganic foods. She enjoyed the market because she bought ingredients that she and her friends used them for a soup. 00:06:00 � She went to I.S. 238. In Queens. Her school had a huge playground. She had to wear a uniform, which she liked because no one could judge her for her fashion. Her school had lockers. She did drama in school along with chorus. 00:09:45 � she went to John Bowne High School. It�s right behind Queens College. She liked high school because it had the programs she was interested in like the Doshi program. Her favorite memory was going to a school party. She took the bus to get to school. 00:13:30 � She was late for her SATs because of the MTA. She didn�t have enough money for the bus fare. 00:16:00 � she picked Queens college because it has neuroscience, her subject of choice. She really likes Queens College.

The country celebrates Muslim and Christian holidays. For Eid, she and her family cook and head to the mosque early in the morning. They wear their traditional outfits on Eid. 00:44:00 � She and her family go to a mosque in Coney Island even after moving to Jamaica. She noticed people are starting to move out of the area. Now, she lives in the southside of Jamaica. It is commonly thought of as the ghetto but she doesn�t think it is. She likes Queens more because it is less hectic. 00:50:00 � She likes the people she has met at the Queens College Muslim Students Association. It has felt homely here. The people there have given her purpose. She can talk about anything from serious things to the nonsensical with her friends. ",
  "Adler_Lara_timecode.txt": "\"This is something that would be unique to the borough, to be able to hold on to the original context of this plot.\" Until a few years ago Lara Adler was “the type of New Yorker who curses out her boss after work.” Now, she has finally found her passion as a holistic health coach. She helps people with health problems bring together the components that make for a happy life, such as natural food, good relationships, fulfillment at work and spiritual balance. A few months ago Lara decided to implement her mission on a larger scale. Lara teamed up with six other Sunnyside and Woodside residents to form the Sunnyside Community Garden Collaboration and fight for the creation of a communal outdoor space on a landmarked, abandoned property next to her home on 50th Street. Until 1997 the derelict playground with slide and swings, sycamore trees, charming old tin shed and gazebo belonged to the Phipps Garden community across the street on 39th Avenue. But since 2007, when Phipps sold the lot to DBH Associates, a private developer from Woodside, the only ones enjoying it have been the colonies of black squirrels and stray cats who have made it home. “It’s an eyesore right next to my home,” says Lara, who wants turn the 10,000-square-feet “bag catcher”— the ugly chain-link fencing catches bags and debris—into a nature learning plot for public school children, vegetable beds, a shaded, wheelchair-accessible area with benches and an outdoor performance space. A community garden, Lara thinks, can be a first step in connecting humans with nature and residents with each other. “It is one thing to sprout a seed in a plastic cup and then take it home to your parents only to have it wither and die,” she says. “It’s a lot more exciting to watch it grow and have it produce something you can eat.” The space should be functional, but beyond the “Oh-look-there-are-some-pretty-tomatoes-growing-that-are-gonna-feed- someone-but-not-me.” A Jazz band could play under the existing gazebo and the “adorable little tin shed plopped in the center adds a lot of character.” She says, “This is something that would be unique to the borough, to be able to hold on to the original context of this plot.” A former development proposal from DBH Associates has been turned down by the Landmarks Commission. Lara hopes that the developer, who acquired the land for $1.4 million, will donate it to a nonprofit organization and use it as a tax write-off, or at least be willing to accommodate the community’s urgent need for connection and public green space. “Now is the best time to jump on it,” says Lara, who thinks New York’s growing interest in farmers markets and ecological living will work in her favor. Her group has already gained support from Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer and it recently applied for funding from North Star’s Greening Western Queens Fund. The fund stems from, a $7.9 million settlement from Con Edison and is dedicated to investing in energy-efficiency and environmental projects in the communities affected by the 2006 blackout. If allotted, the Sunnyside Community Garden Collaboration will use an initial $5,400 grant for a fact-finding mission, for renting space for outreach meetings, for printing costs for flyers and to build a website to gather community support and opposition against the developer.

  "Alberstadt_timecode.txt": "Jesse Joyce, Andy Hendrickson, Keith Alberstadt are all comedians who live in Astoria. They talk about why a lot of comedians live in Astoria (it's easy to get away -by car or air -is one reason); what makes a successful comedian; and comedians who they do and do not admire. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A year in the life of a street\" project (www.30thAve.org). Transcript notes for research Jesse Joyce (JJ): I've performed for British crowds in Singapore and Switzerland before. They're horrible. Every one of them. It's the comedy sensibility that seems so deeply rooted in the idea that the funniest thing you could do is be a dude in a dress. Andy Hendrickson (AH): I enjoyed England. I went around to different venues and stuff, I had a good time. And I didn't have any extreme heckling. Keith Alberstadt (KA): It sounds cliche, but I was the youngest in the family and kind of starved for attention, always enjoyed making people laugh. Sat on the bench on the baseball team but always made people laugh. I hosted a talent show in high school and loved it. So I started doing it. Bombed miserably for about five years through college and then things started to get better. That was Nashville Tennessee, home of the mighty commodores. AH: My story is pretty much exactly the same. I was the baby of the family. I also think it was because we moved around a lot. I was a navy brat, so I think that was how I ended up being funny. Then in Atlanta I saw a guy who taught a comedy class -I had to pay to motivate myself basically. JJ: We all spent thanksgiving together a couple of years ago and saw his first stand up video. It was terrible. We were at his mom's house and found the video of the first time. AH: I still use all those jokes too. JJ: Everybody's awful the first year or two, or three. You only get good at it after years and years of practice. KA: The reason why it's so fun and motivating for us and rewarding is because we remember how bad it used to be, and how more shows were bad than good. And now we have more shows that are good than bad, we appreciate our accomplishments more because we know where we came from. JJ: There is a badge of honor. We've known each other for around 8 years, so we kind of respect the fact that we were in the trenches together. What makes a comedian a good comedian is just doing it for ever. Nobody gets really good at comedy until they've been doing it for around 20 to 25 years. I mean every dude that we respect is in their 40s. All of them. They've all been doing it for 25 years. Yes, most comedians are male. Maybe it's about 10 per cent of comedians are women. Guys are more analytical I think, maybe. It's also kind of an alpha thing to want to do with your life. To feel the need to be on the stage with amplified sound and lighting and all the other people sitting on tiny chairs in the dark. Women don't seem to have that need. I read a GQ article about that. There was also a point when they said women have never had to develop a sense of humor, it's not a thing that they needed to do socially. Because women can get in the door any number of other ways. But as a guy it's kind of important if you want to impress a girl if you're not like fast, or strong. So you develop a sense of humor. AH: Yes that used to be the only way I met girls. I used to be an awkward guy. But I was kind of funny, from elementary school up through beginnings of high school till I started to figure it out. But comedy was definitely important. JJ: Yes and I was moving around a lot too, and that really hones your sense of humor, so you feel you have to break the ice with like 30 new kids in this class, and the best way to do it is probably to make them laugh. A sense of humor becomes a priority for a guy and it's not so much a premium for young girls growing up -like \"I've got to be a jackass in class\". AH: I started comedy when I was 28. I'm 40 now. I did a bunch of stuff, I made signs, I worked for an exhibit company doing graphics. JJ: And I don't want to speak for you but it's not like you didn't know that you were funny. It's just a giant leap from being a funny dude to thinking right I'm going to be a comedian. AH: And I was in Atlanta where there was one comedy club, there was no-where to get up. Even when I decided to do it we had to make our own places to do shows. JJ: You started in your mid-twenties didn't you? KA: Well I started in college but I was more enamored with the college life and drinking beers and hanging out and chasing girls. JJ: Funny that's never worn off. KA: Then I got bit by that bug and just kept doing it. That's another thing that makes a good comic you keep that persistence, keep going back, get knocked down and get back out there. AH: Once you've been doing it for a certain amount of years your brain starts thinking in comedy terms. I mean everything, you think can I turn that into a joke? JJ: Yes, I'll at times think of a funny word for a punch-line that I just keep until I need it. KA: Also everybody you meet, mostly girls, assumes that everything you say or do will be used against them on stage. They will get turned into a bit. And you say \"no of course not\" and then you do. You can't go to a wedding or a class reunion or whatever and you can'tjust be a normal person having a conversation, people are always like \"you're going to use this aren't you?\" JJ: Andy and I flew back from Shanghai together and there was a mid-western couple sitting next to us. They were like \"what do you guys do for a living\" and we said that we sold those springs in a pen, just because we didn't want 17 hours of them saying \"you're going to put this in your act\". JJ: Some people are really good at it but the lifestyle wears them down after years. Lots of guys I know who really were funny dudes decided to go and work in TV, or do something else. So it's the combination of being good at it and keep pushing through the bullshit of the lifestyle. We're gone all the time. KA: When the industry kicks us in the nuts we have to remind ourselves that it's actually a blessing that it's difficult. Because ifit weren't, we'd have a thousand more comics. Which would make it more of a saturated market than it is. So because it's hard to get stage time, and there's all the travel, that's what helps the people who are really dedicated to rise above the ones who aren't. JJ: There are many times when I don't feel like getting up on the stage. But once I get the first laugh I'm right in there. KA: One time I had to drive seven hours straight to another show and there wasn't even enough time to go to the hotel but as soon as you're on the stage that's fine. AH: it also works the other way though as well, like if you haven't been performing for say four or five days, you feel you just have to get back onstage. JJ: We were in Iraq a month together [all three have performed for the troops] AH: Well I like to just make jokes about how great it is back at home, with the TV, hanging out a bars. JJ: There's this joke a comedian would say to 600 guys who'd been there for nine months, hey when you get home don'tjustjump on your wife because it's you who hasn't had sex all in a while, not her. They're a great audience because they're just bored and they want someone to distract them from it, so those are the easiest shows ever. Armed Forces Entertainment pays us. I used to be on Bob and Tom before, a massive syndicated show in the bread basket of America and their listeners are very wholesome, troop-supporting people so right before I went to Iraq they gave me a duffel bag of stuff to give to the troops. We gave it away in three days because we didn't want to carrying it around all month long. AH: [Astoria is good because] for the most part it's easy to get in and out of Manhattan, and then there's parking and you can also get out onto the highway pretty quick you just cross the Triborough or RFK or whatever they call it now. So that's great. To know you can just cross a couple of bridges and you're out there. JJ: You know how you're meant to get to the airport an hour before the flight. I leave my apartment an hour before the flight because it just takes you right to La Guardia. KA: There's the guy who sells books just here on 30th Ave and 31st Street. And some of the books are really good. AH: the internet has changed everything. A guy was trying to predict the future of comedy ten years from now and said how a lot of the old school guys will die out because they're not going to be able to adapt to the new media. Everything's getting segmented and broken down to little pieces and there's no mainstream way to make it anymore. People develop a following online. And people are starting to use multimedia in their shows -I don't want to have to do that stuff. KA: All it takes is one video, whether it's a fake commercial or skit or bit from your standup act to go viral. Anjelah Johnson is a comedian based in LA who sells out everywhere. And she just posted a You Tube video joke about a nail salon and it went global. AH: Not funny! KA: I think she's adorable. JJ: I decided a long time ago that I don't want to cater to as big an audience as possible. Dane Cook and guys like that, they cater to as many people as possible. There's nobody who doesn't get it but it's not very sophisticated, its' just on one level. The number one demographic that doesn't seem to appreciate me are women in their late fifties. So the people who do come out and see me, they really like what I do. But I mean, Louis CK has a great following and so do guys who have put a cap on what they're going to do because they're edgier, darker or whatever. AH: On the other hand there's Keith. He works clean. As in more digestible for a larger audience. Clean can open up a lot of opportunities. KA: Yes, I don't turn many people off. Andy: [re recent criticisms of Tracy Morgan for homophobic jokes]. I think you should be able to say whatever you want to say. But what he said was mean. JJ: What no-body seems to talk about is that what he said is not funny. That's the point. Louis CK has phenomenal jokes about siding with child molesters and its fucking great because he's funny. There would be nothing wrong with what he said if the comedy outweighed the shitty thing he said. But it didn't because he's not a funny dude. People who write for him on 30 Rock and Sat Night Live, they're funny. And he's a good goofy comedic actor guy. But he is a terribly un-funny human being. When he's on his own, nobody wants to hear his own thoughts on something. It's the same thing I have with Michael Richards. He happens to be a racist and he's a shitty comic. And the fact that he's not a good comic means that racist shit just comes out of his mind. Same thing with John Mayer who got into trouble saying something vaguely racist in Playboy. He was trying to be funny but he's not good enough at funny to pull it off, so it just came off as racist. The Comedy Central Roasts are as racist and homophobic and anti-Semitic and sexist as you could possibly get. And yet no-one ever calls out an individual and says that was inappropriate. Because the humor outweighs the sentiment. KA: Plus people understand it's a roast and so they understand it's meant to be offensive and they accept it as such. People at Tracy's show they should know that it's not to be taken seriously. I could go on for ever about how this country is on eggshells and how you can't say things. You can have ten thousand people who don't have a problem with something then all it takes is one person to have a problem with it all of a sudden there's a controversy. All it takes is one person to say 'he should lose his job'. AH: Social Media means things can get taken out of context too. JJ: Yes in fairness there's no recording of him saying that. So what I will say in favor of Tracy Morgan is that his comments could very easily have been taken out of context. It's third hand. It's a dude who was at the show who wrote it on his Facebook page and everybody just ran with it. I think he has done a good job of squelching it though as best as he could, apologizing etc. KA: Because he had to. JJ: Louis CK is the best guy doing it these days. Just because he's so brutally honest. He really has mastered the ability to take any topic regardless of whether or not you agree with it and you can't deny that you see his point. You can't argue with the logic of the joke and it's flawless. So even if you disagree with it you can still laugh at it because he's walked you through the logic in his head. KA: Which is what Stanhope does but Louis is much more likeable than Stanhope, which helps a lot. You don't have to be likeable but you can appeal to a much bigger percentage of the crowd if you are -people are more likely to go along with your joke. JJ: There are plenty of comics who set out to be unlikeable but that makes it harder to do topics that the crowd might not be on board with. KA: What's troubling in NYC to me is a lot of people who take pride in not being likeable. It's like the more people who don't laugh. A lot of northwest comics are like that too, but especially here. They take pride in walking the crowd, you know so that somebody walked out, and they take pride in the fact they offended somebody -like aren't I edgy, aren't I rebellious, and I think well you're not doing anything, how is that succeeding? JJ: That's in part because some of the popular comics have made it that way but that's only because they're so skilled at doing it. Now every open mic-er had a super-edgy rape joke or an AIDS button that they hit. But they're not yet skilled enough as comedians to bring that up. JJ: I like Chappelle and Jon Stewart, always a favorite of mine. I think Jon Stewart is a good example of sticking with it. You never know when something's going to happen. I saw Jon Stewart when I had been doing standup for like 6 months, like 13 years ago, I saw him at a comedy club. He had nothing going on career-wise. It was after he'd had his show on MTV 7-8 years after that but everyone else had forgotten it. So he was just right in the middle of doing what we do, which is just being a guy on the road in a fucking club and he was great. I was like man this guy should be big. He did that show and then two years later he still was just doing those things, and there were still another five years before he got the Daily Show. That club was packed but not sure if it was packed because of him or because it was a Saturday. He crushed. He had a leather jacket and smoked cigarettes and had a six pack of Heineken on stage with him. But the point is you never know when the Daily Show is going to come around the corner. He just auditioned for that, you know what I mean, and now he's influencing global politics and hosting the Oscars and doing the white house correspondents dinner. AH: I don't know how great Astoria is for comedy. I've never been to a really great comedy show here. JJ: You know what Astoria is where they live but it's not where we want to perform. KA: But I will say this. Every time I go to a show in Astoria, whether it's here or in the beer garden or in Rest Au Rant, the shows are not stellar or off the charts but it's such a good time, the camaraderie, the hang-out time with the other comedians talking shop or whatever, it's really, really fun. You go to Manhattan and a comedy club you might see friends you want to hang out with but a lot of times you can't really talk because it's such a confined space and the noise is going to carry off to the showroom. JJ: Another reason why Astoria shows may not be where it's at is the other point you made, that this is such an ethnically diverse spot. Is the Bangladeshi couple next door or are the Sudanese people nearby going to come to my show? Like Brooklyn is so kind of hip and homogenous that shows there kind of make more sense. Shows in Astoria ... are not altogether that logical. ",
  "Alcantara_Eric_timecode.txt": "“It’s one of those things where you can draw all day and not get in trouble for it.” Born in the Philippines, Eric Alcantara loved to draw since he was a small child. In his 20s he tried out graphic design and advertisement but wasn’t fully satisfied with what the profession had to offer. “It is more gratifying to do something that’s meaningful to [an individual] than to advertise a product,” the 30-year-old says. Eric has been the tattoo industry, which he describes as “intimate and family-oriented,” for the past five years. After a stint in Hoboken, he began adorning the bodies of Sunnyside residents at the Sunnyside Tattoo Studio on Queens Boulevard and 39th Street three months ago. He much prefers Sunnyside to Hoboken where his clients were mainly “eccentric college kids.” Many of his Sunnyside clients are “down-to-earth,” working-class Hispanics who gravitate toward religious emblems and images that celebrate their home country. One of Eric’s “craziest” tattoos in Sunnyside was a string of rosary beads around someone’s neck meant to cover up a previous tattoo. “It is not necessarily about the design, but the placement can be crazy,” he says. “At one point I thought I’m going to make him cry.” The neck is a particularly painful area because of the skin’s proximity to the collarbone. While Eric tries to price his work based on a time estimate—one hour is priced up to $150—he acknowledges that many of clients don’t have much money. His artwork is negotiable and its quality far more important than his income. “Where do you see yourself in 20 years?” I ask Eric. “I think I found my calling in life,” he says without hesitation. “I can’t imagine myself retiring from the industry. It’s one of those things where you can draw all day and not get in trouble for it.” In the podcast Eric talks about the long road to becoming a tattoo artist, his very first tattoo job and his Sunnyside clientele.

  "Ali_Yousafi_timecode.txt": "“We are coming here to save our lives.” I spoke to Yousafi Jan Ali while a mechanic was repairing his Kebab cart under the 46th Street subway station. Loud traffic and subway noise enveloped us. The 37-year-old introduced himself as Ali with a broad, but utterly shy smile. He admitted his fear that his English might not be good enough for an audio interview. Ali, his wife, parents and three children fled Afghanistan in 2002. After the Taliban killed his cousin, his cousin’s family and some of his friends, he didn’t feel safe anymore in his native country. Ali prefers to live in Long Island, but likes Sunnyside. He despises the winter when he is exposed to the freezing cold and dampness. One year ago, when Ali started working in Sunnyside, his business was good. Over the last six months, though, it has dwindled. His clients, he says, are nice, working people. Only once on a weekend did he call 911, when two drunk customers refused to pay. The thieves escaped into the subway station and the police never showed up. Undeterred, Ali waves this episode off. “I love America,” he says. “Americans are good people. They know that we are not terrorists. We are here with family. We are coming here to save our lives.” ",
  "Almaz_Ralph_timecode.txt": "Ralph and Yury Almaz are brothers from Uzbekistan, who set up their own jewelry store on Astoria's 30th Ave in 1985. They specialize in engagement and wedding jewelry. They buy many of their products at the bi-annual jewelry fairs at Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan but then customize it themselves. Ralph focuses on the front of shop work, and Yury on customizing the jewelry. Yury's son is in the diamond cutting business in Israel, and they import some of their diamonds from there. At the moment a lot of people are coming into the shop to sell their old gold items. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A year in the life of a street\" project (www.30thAve.org). Transcript notes for research Ralph Almaz (RA): We opened this store 26 years ago, 1985, me and my brother Yury. We're originally from Uzbekistan. We come from generations of jewelers in Uzbekistan. Our grandfather used to be in the business so when we came to this country we decided to open this jewelry store. It always was a dynamic neighborhood, very colorful and multi-ethnic. It's kept the same way all these years. Now we see a lot more young professionals moving in though. Our specialty is engagement rings and bridal jewelry, wedding bands etc. We also do custom jewelry. Sometimes it's happened that people bring the ring back. So in that case we offer them to restyle the ring, if they don't want it to look like an engagement ring. Or if not they can sell it back. They take a loss of course -but we offer to buy it back. We attend the international jewelry shows at Jacob Javits Convention Center and they represent jewelers from all over the world. Italy, Hong Kong, Israel, Turkey, Brazil. So we do shopping there. It takes place in NYC twice a year. Winter show and summer show. Most of it we buy there but then most of it we custom create in our store. Watches are also very popular, all different brands. It is possible to go back to Uzbekistan. We don't go very often. Most of our family hs left but we have some people left there, some friends and relatives. It wasn't so easy when we left to communicate. It was during the iron curtain in the late seventies. But now it's very open and people can come here, we can go there, talk on email, skype etc. Each of us has his own portion of the work. My area is here in the floor and customer relations and my brother is in the back of the shop where he does the customizing of the jewelry. Yury Almaz (YA): I also work in some manufacturing of diamonds in Israel. My family is in this business and my son is in this business, and we import diamonds from Israel also. They are the biggest cutters of diamonds. The large diamonds for engagement rings etc. are from Israel. I most enjoy creating something special. RA: We have a good customer base. Someone buys from the family and then the whole family comes. It goes from mouth to mouth. Right now there's a new trend of people bringing back a lot of their gold. They want to take advantage of high gold prices and now everyone also wants to sell their old jewelry, coins and diamonds. If it's an interesting item we try to sell it. But in most cases we melt down everything and then sell it to refiners. So we make our portion there, a little profit. ",
  "Amin_MohamedQ_timecode.txt": "Mohamed Q. Amin was born in Guyana, and came to live in Far Rockaway in January 1996 when he was twelve. He went to junior high and high school in Far Rockaway. He went to college at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City and graduated from Queens College in Flushing. He moved to Richmond Hill during this time when he purchased a house with his parents. Mohamed is the founder and executive director of the Caribbean Equality Project, an LGBTQ organization whose purpose is to empower and educate the Caribbean LGBTQ population in New York and inform outside communities about the Caribbean LGBTQ community. This is an all-volunteer organization and Mohamed is also currently employed as a bank supervisor. He currently lives with his partner and two sisters in Richmond Hills. Mohamed’s brother is an international dancer known as Zaman. Key events that led to Mr. Amin’s activism are his experience as a Muslim living through the September 11th events in New York City and the gay bashing of his brother in a Richmond Hill bar in 2013. 00:00: 30 He was born on April 3, 1983 in Guyana, South America. His mother and father are Guyanese. They speak English and Guyanese Creole. His family’s religion is Muslim. He has a partner, who was born in Trinidad. His partners’ parents are Trinidadian and Guyanese. They have been together twelve years. 00:02:28 He came to New York City from Guyana to live in the Far Rockaway on January 10, 1996 during a large snow storm. He went to junior high and high school in Far Rockaway and lived in the neighborhood until he was twenty-two years old. His experience as an organizer and leader began in high school. He was the president of his school government club and he worked to mobilize students to coexist who were from different cultures. He was also homecoming king, on the year book committee, and was very active in art. His high school group wanted to make a difference and understood the importance of forming cross cultural bonds and bringing the school together against the violence they faced in the school. He learned it doesn’t matter what your background is, you can make a difference. 00:07:13 When Mohamed was a high school sophomore, he was chosen by his art teacher to represent his high school at an art exhibit at the Queens Museum Art exhibit by artist Dawoud Bey. When he traveled to the Museum, it was the first time he saw many parts of Queens, including the Unisphere. He was encouraged to participate in New York as an young artist and encouraged to be part of the community’s future. 00:11:21 Mohamed graduated in the top 10 of his class with his friends. They organized and mobilized, with the encouragement of his teachers at Far Rockaway High School, during his senior year there. That experience provided him the confidence to succeed later as a leader. 00:12:22 By now, he lived in the 1450 Gateway Apartments where his father helped manage the building. After graduating high school, he explored many parts of the New York City by traveling everywhere he could with his high school friends on public transportation. They explored all of Manhattan, including the theatre district and attended shows. Although he experienced racism and classism, it did not stop the group from exploring many parts of NYC. 00:14:38 Mohamed was accepted into SUNY Buffalo, but his father did not allow him to attend a college so far away from home. Instead, he attended LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City. That meant he had a commute of three hours, getting there by the A train and the 7 subway through Manhattan. Going to college, he learned to navigate things like bank accounts, travel, and other aspects of living in New York City. He taught that to his parents and his younger brother and two sisters. 00:20:53 During this time, 2001, when he was in college, it was difficult for him to come to terms with his internal struggles about being gay. There was a lot of violence against gays and he felt responsible to his family. He and his sisters and brothers were all successful graduates of Far Rockaway High School. He and his father had different values and he wanted to participate more in NYC culture and life. His father had a steady job and could save money and provide economic stability and a good future for his family. His mother has always been a source of support for him and all his brothers and sisters. Mohamed also worked during high school. 00:25:18* 9/11/2001 was a pivotal and traumatizing event for Mohamed. It occurred on his second day of college, and he spent hours and his entire allowance getting home that day. During the rest of the year in college, he faced many overt displays of discrimination, due to his name, his Muslim religion and his status as an immigrant. He faced general ignorance about the Muslim community from his class-mates. He spoke out against it, but felt very isolated. [quote about being a Muslim will never be the same after 9/11 at 31:00-32:13] 00:34:16 He was given a car after he graduated from high school. He took his parents and family everywhere until his father learned to drive. It was during this time that he discovered Richmond Hill’s Guyanese population. 00:36:15* He finished LaGuardia after he convinced his friend, Mayesha to go there. They went together and supported each other as they went through the school. They were not supported by any organization or school authorities at LaGuardia. His friend also supported him when he came out to her as gay during the summer of 2001. He encountered a lot of discrimination for being Muslim. [quote about his self-identity and reflections about the fears of his community in the aftermath of 9/11, especially thinking he should change his name at 39:15-41:42. ] 00:41:50 He worked throughout college as a receptionist at a beauty salon. He had worked at a discount store before then. He took banking classes and took a bank teller course. He applied for a job at many banks and eventually got a job at the New York Community Bank in 2003. His job was located at the Pathmark at 92nd and also at Atlantic Avenue in Far Rockaway. He worked at NYCB for eight years, both at Howard Beach and Pathmark. He took a break from school after LaGuardia to work full-time between 2004 and 2005. 00:46:45* He began meeting gay people through AOL chat rooms in 2004. He began to attend hangouts in Queens, Manhattan and Astoria. [ quote at 48:04-49:10 about needing to get away from home and Far Rockaway to come out as gay to his family and the difficulties he faced during this time -period]. 00:49:11* Mohamed’s father helped him purchase a home in South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill in May 2005. It would be for him and his sisters to move into eventually. Richmond Hill was close to his Caribbean, Guyanese community and near his job. Richmond Hill has really transformed since then. He was reintegrated back into his Guyanese culture, but there was a lot of race discrimination and homophobia in Richmond Hill. There were no gay bars, but he met gay people at house parties where he could meet Caribbean gay people. [See 52:40 for a quote]. The bars occasionally had a space for gay people, but it was very uncomfortable to go to them. 00:54:55* He attended Queens College in Flushing, New York to complete his Bachelor’s Degree in 2006. He worked full time and went to school full time. He met his partner, Anoop, then on an AOL chat line. It was the safest way to meet gay people. He still faced a lot of discrimination in Richmond Hill when he brought his gay friends there. Called an “auntie man” in Richmond Hill [quote at 59:07] [Quote at 56:40- 59:25 describes his experience in Richmond Hill during this time]. 00:59 He is part of the change towards more tolerance now. He met Caribbean queer people through a social club named the Curry Club and they would party in the City because no one felt safe in Queens. It made him realize how proud he could be as a Caribbean LGBT person. This was for him the 2005-6-time period, although the group had existed before then. He was not out to his family, school or work. He was living with his partner and introduced him to his family as his roommate. 01:02:57* He came out to his parents when he was 26 in 2009. He was out to his siblings and they were supportive. [Clip about coming out to his parents is at 1:03:00-1:13]. It was more difficult for his parents, especially his father, although they have become supportive over time. He felt initially like he had “broken his family…” [at 1:07]. As he transitioned to his own acceptance he needed to transition his parents to understand him [at 1:10]. He had “conditional love” from his parents as they loved him but had difficulty understanding this new part of him. [at 1:11-1:13] He struggled daily to come out to people. You come out every day until today. [at 1:13:08-14]. He looks for understanding, not acceptance. By “understanding” he means “people should understand how they play a role in his safety and equality.” [at 1:14:20]. 01:15:00 His sisters live with him in Richmond Hill and his brother lives with his parents. One of his sisters has a Master’s degree and is a teacher at Rosa Parks School in Queens. His other sister works at Queens College. He is a supervisor at TD Bank. 01:16:37* His brother is also gay and had a difficult time talking about it with Mohamed and his family. His brother was outed. Mohamed explains how what happened to his brother was a form of violence, “Outing is violence” [see 1:18 -1:19:06]. 1:19:40 In 2010, he began to get more active politically, to unite Caribbean people and the LGBT community. He got involved with Pride in Manhattan. He was recruited by Tina, who hosted social parties for Caribbean people, to organize a Caribbean contingent for Pride in Manhattan. He wanted to do more than social events. His goal was to create educational opportunities for the Caribbean community, the queer community and the general community throughout New York. 01:23:31 Today, his brother is the internationally known dancer, Zaman. He also dances as the drag queen named Sundari Indian-Goddess and has, through his talent as a professional dancer, won many awards for his performances, which combine his Indo-Caribbean culture with his training in Kathak, Orissi, Bollywood, Bhangra and Chutney dances. He is the very first to perform his unique blend of these dances to both queer, Caribbean and international audiences. 01:25:00 Mohamed and his brother participated in the Queens Pride Parade in 2013. He could integrate both his identities as an LGBT person and an immigrant member of the Caribbean community and he always holds both the flags of Guyana and the LGBT communities when he marches. At the same event, his brother, as Sundari Indian-Goddess, won the Queene award as the best drag entertainment along with another performer named Felicia. It was the first time tassa drums were played at Queens Pride. [See 1:27]. They are breaking down the walls of drag entertainment to the broader community. He stays involved in Queens Pride until now. 01:30:00* An event that changed his whole family occurred in June of 2013. His partner entered a cooking contest at a bar named ‘Players’ in Richmond Hill. ‘Players’ was located on 129th Liberty Avenue. The MC identified the gay group in the bar and the environment became very toxic. When his partner won the second prize award, a man called them an “auntie man.” Mohamed asked him to stop and was pushed by the man. His partner went to his defense. They were attacked by the tassa players with their drum sticks. They hit his brother with the trophy. No one helped them at the bar. The bar manager hid the assailant. The police were dismissive. His parents learned about while they were in Guyana from a newspaper report about the incident. This anti-gay incident in Richmond Hill, involving his partner and brother mobilized Mohamed and his family. They organized a rally through the help of non-profits in Richmond Hill, including the Indo Caribbean Alliance. AVP, NYC Anti-Violence project helped his family with counseling around the event for the next year. Key clip for gay bashing in Richmond Hill is 1:30-1:36. 01:38:00* The assault in Richmond Hill led to the formation of the Caribbean Equality Project. It was formed as a non-profit organization in January 2015. See 1:40 for purpose of CEP. See 1:41 for purpose of AVP. AVP helped with lawyers and he received professional counseling in Jackson Heights. Mohamed also took their speakers bureau training. He “found his voice” and could express what happened to him and mobilize the Caribbean Equality Project in 2014. See clip from 1:40-1:44 about formation of the CEP. 01:44:21* The other founders of C.E.P. are Krishna and Andy. It’s an all-volunteer organization. They respond to incidents of violence, educate the community, and hold monthly support groups. They launched publicly on June 25, 2015, the same day the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal in the United States. That created a synergy of support for CEP. 1:46-1:50 clip about formation of the Caribbean Equality Project. 01:50:00* In 2017, they are going to be in the Manhattan Pride Parade for the first time. It is especially important this year because under Trump our health care, immigrants and being LGBT are all threatened. He has received a lot of publicity for CEP. In 2016, he finally was granted entrance in the Phagwah parade, a Hindu celebration of the Spring, the first time there was an LGBT presence in this Parade. It took four years to get permission to join the parade. See 1:57-1:57:40 for what it meant to be in the Phagwah Parade. 01:58:00* Guyanese people are the second largest community in New York City. Unchained is the first support group for queer Caribbean anywhere. They have not found another group like theirs in the country. They support LGBT organizations in the Caribbean countries. Other organizations in NYC support them. Council member Dromm has provided key support. The support of Council member Dromm’s is very critical to their success. They have a YouTube channel that shows “My Truth My Story”, which interviews LGBT Caribbean people. The C.E.P. received an award in May 2017 for their work to help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Queens Pride. See 2:02-03 for the importance of Daniel Dromm’s activism. 02:03:37 Mohamed hopes for the future. He believes that younger people will want to continue the work of C.E.P. They have touched lives throughout the world. They quantify their growth through social media data. Facebook has engaged 3-4,000 people. The C.E.P.’s YouTube channel is viewed daily. C.E.P. has spread its message through Instagram and local and regional press including some West Indian newspapers. They can document their history through the Queens Memory Project and other archives. [ clip at 2:03-2:04 about the meaning of CEP. ]",
  "Anderson_Bridget_timecode.txt": "Bridget was born in Doon, East Limerick, Ireland. Her father was a foreman for road work crews. Her mother was very intelligent, although she didn�t have access to formal education. Bridget received primary education in Ireland, but she was not able to afford secondary education and worked as a nanny. In 1957, she immigrated to America, following her sister to the Bronx, where she worked as a telephone operator. She met her husband, originally a neighbor in Ireland, in Gaelic Park. They married and moved to an apartment in the Bronx, where their first child was born. Soon after, the family moved to 52nd Street in Woodside. On moving day, their second child was born at the door of St. Luke�s-Roosevelt Women�s Hospital. Bridget�s husband died when their nine children were still young, but all children still live in the region. Bridget feels that she found a better life for herself and her children in America. 00:00:15 Life in Ireland wasn�t great. Secondary education was expensive, so she was only able to go to primary school. Grew up in Doon, East Limerick; studied English, Irish, math, singing, and traditional Irish dancing. Was a good writer and performed in school plays. Can speak Irish: �How are you� �I am well� in Irish. Remembers nun who didn�t speak Irish. Children would roll bicycle tire with a stick for fun. 00:03:16 She was the oldest child with one sister in the US and another in Ireland, two brothers in US. Father was foreman for roadwork crews. Both parents were from County Tipperary, across the border. 00:04:23 Sister was in America first and a visiting cousin from the US encouraged immigration. At the time you had to be sponsored and find for a job. Traveled alone on Pan Am plane in 1957, and was very afraid. She lived with sister in apartment in Tenbroeck Avenue in the Bronx. 00:06:04 Worked as a nanny in Ireland, and worked as telephone operator in New York. Not much money was left over after paycheck. She also worked as live-in service for private households, like many immigrant women, for $50 a week. 00:07:22 Danced at City Center for fun, 86th street, and there were some Irish pubs around. After living in the US for a week, her sister met her husband at their first dance. 00:08:21 Bridget�s Husband was a next door neighbor in Ireland, but they didn�t meet romantically until they met again at Gaelic Park. They were married at St. Thomas More on East 89th Street. Moved to an apartment in the Bronx, but Bridget continued to work every day. 00:09:12* Father Ryan, later of St. Sebastian, told couple about six family house (railroad apartments) on 52nd Street in Woodside. Moved in on the day second child was born. Bridget went into labor while her husband was moving and needed a police escort to St. Luke�s-Roosevelt Women�s Hospital. The baby was born inside the door (Danny). 00:10:44 Loved Woodside � shops, transportation, and the schools were close, and she met some people from Ireland, but not from her own region. Bridget was involved in Girl Scouts. In 1997, she went to LaGuardia to study Spanish, but doesn�t remember much Spanish. She taught religion for five years on Saturdays to public school students at St. Sebastian. The couple had 9 children born in 10 years � 6 boys and 3 girls. All still live in the region - Jackson Heights, Montauk, Woodside, New Jersey, Massapequa, Huntington , Brooklyn, Floral Park, and Oyster Bay. They have 18 grandchildren.

  "Annecco_Joe_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Joe Annecco has discussed about how his neighborhood changed a lot when it came to diversity. He also discussed about his experience in different neighborhood before when moved to his recently new house. He talked about how his neighbors started to change and how it shows that kids and adults are changing their lifestyle as they grow older. 00:00:13 Joe rented in his grandmother’s apartment and he moved out and bought his own house. 00:00:23 Joe’s grandmother’s apartment was built in 1928 and the house was very expensive before and now if they were to sell it. He lived there for 14 years and he was living with his mother, father, and his two sisters before they moved out. 00:01:03 When Joe bought his new house, he lived with his mother, father, his two sisters, and their new dog. 00:01:13 the thing that made the house special to them was that fact that it was really spacious and a lot of family members. It was the perfect place for them to play hide and seek. The backyard was really big that the kids in their block used to go there with their bikes and hang out. 00:01:39 the reason why they are moving out of their house was because his father found another house that was bigger and they bought that house afterwards. The new house consists of having a bigger backyard and swimming pool. 00:01:53 Joe liked both of the houses because he had memorable memories with his friends and family hanging out in both houses. 00:02:15 everyone in Ozone Park, in his neighborhood, knew each other. Everyone used to go to each other’s’ house and they used to eat and drink there. It didn’t matter who you were, they would have taken care of you. 00:02:26 When Joe got older, Joe noticed that the old family moved out because the younger kids grew up. When the younger family moved into the neighborhood, they didn’t have a tight relationship with them. 00:02:51 the people in his neighborhood back then were mostly Italian. When they moved out, other nationality from different countries came in. The neighborhood was more diverse. 00:03:07 the neighborhood was mostly middle class people living there; the neighbors were also nice. When other kids from the block were to come to their house, they would have fed them. The neighbors treated each other more like a family; it was more family-oriented. 00:04:28 the biggest change in the neighborhood was the kids because back then, the kids were to play outside in the block playing sports and games with each other. However, now the kids usually stay at home and play with their cellphones and television games. 00:05:00 Joe believes that property values are going really high. Everything is getting more advance and better than before, but it is getting more expensive. The casino that was recently built in the neighborhood actually made the neighborhood’s appearance look better. 00:05:36 Joe’s neighborhood consists of more people now. When more people came into the neighborhood, they needed to build more houses. So they have to get rid some of the fields in the parks since no one was playing in it and create houses there. 00:06:13 back then, kids used leave their bikes on the street without any locks attached to it. Now, they have to lock their bikes because people usually steal a bike if it was left alone. 00:07:23 in the past, they used to have the green bus lines, which is now the MTA. They either would have a cab, bicycle, or walk to other places. Joe doesn’t ride a bike anymore and he is still walks to get to other places. 00:08:06 in the past, Joe’s mother or father drove Joe to work or he had to walk to work if they were busy. 00:08:27 in the past, the neighborhood only had 3 buses and cabs. Today, there are a lot of buses, trains, and other cab corporations. 00:08:50 back in the day, Ozone Park was a unique place to grow up. Everyone knew each other. There was hardly any traffic, so the kids were playing in the street till night time. 00:09:59 everyone knew each other by their first name. Today, Joe feels like no one knows each other anymore because the neighborhood is getting overpopulated. 00:10:23 while growing up in Ozone Park, there were 90% Catholic. Now, everyone is Catholic in the neighborhood. Joe went to Catholic school for 8 years; he was disciplined a lot there, but he believes that it made him into a better person. 00:10:46 Joe was more religious back then because he had to go to church. Today, he goes to church in his house. 00:10:59 Today, everyone has their own religion; they practice whatever they want to practice. 00:11:11 Joe and his sister went to Catholic school called Nativity. Joe went there for 8 years and his sister went there for 5 years. His mother and Father thought that Catholic School was safer than public school back in the day. ",
  "Annecco_Penny_timecode.txt": "Penny Annecco has been a Queens resident since she was three years old and moved from Canarsie, Brooklyn to Lindenwood, Queens. She lived in her Queens apartment for twenty years with her parents, and when she got married, she remained in the neighborhood. While she was growing up, she says her community was very close-knit and everyone knew each other. Over time, she found the biggest change to occur was the change in demographics. She also talks about changes in safety, schools, types of shopping areas, transportation and landscape. Overall, Penny wishes the neighborhood would stay the same in the years ahead. 00:00:17 When she was three years old, Penny and her parents from moved Canarsie, Brooklyn to Lindenwood, Queens with her parents. The apartment’s rent was $1,600 dollars a month and the apartment contained two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, and a dining room. 00:01:10 Penny says the neighborhood had a “community feeling” where everyone knew each other. Lindenwood was a completely Jewish or Catholic neighborhood at the time and as a Jew, Penny felt like a typical resident. Penny explains that one of the reasons the neighborhood has changed is because a majority of people gradually began moving to Florida and Long Island. 00:02:44 Walter Ward was a politician and New York City councilman who lived in and represented the neighborhoods of Lindenwood, South Ozone Park, and Howard Beach from 1968 – 1993. P.S.232 was named after the retired councilman. 00:03:15 Over time, Penny says the biggest change in the neighborhood is the demographics. The neighborhood began to be more diverse, and as a result, more cultured. 00:04:19 Over time, the safety of the neighborhood has changed as well. Unlike before, it is not safe to leave your door open anymore. 00:04:41 While she was growing up, Mrs. Annecco says there were a lot of small businesses, as opposed to the big franchises there are now (i.e: Rite Aid). 00:05:07 Penny says the biggest difference between how she grew up and how her kids grew up was playing outside. She and her friends played games, such as hopscotch, at the park from sunrise to sunset. Back then, there were no distractions such as a cell phones and video games, so kids were much more social and vibrant than they are now. 00:06:10 Penny says transportation remains are pretty much the same. The MTA (formerly known as the ‘Green Bus Line’) remain one of the most used means of transportation. The biggest difference is the use of taxi services such as Uber. 00:07:10 Penny says what makes this neighborhood unique from others is that it’s like a little village within a city. Living in Lindenwood was like a “little taste of suburbia”. Two of the main attractions were the pool club and tennis court. However, once the pool club disappeared, she explains the neighborhood changed for the worse. 00:08:32 Penny attended Public School 232 for grades k-6, Middle School 202 for grades 7-9, and John Adams High School. One major difference between schooling now and then is that, in Penny’s opinion, testing is made to be more difficult (i.e: common core). College education also plays a huge role, especially in the lives of young girls, today. In Penny’s day, most girls went to secretarial schools instead of college while today, it is the opposite. 00:10:19 Penny describes an unfortunate incident that occurred at New Park Pizza on Crossbay Blvd. An African American male was chased by Caucasian males out of the pizzeria and onto the Belt Parkway where he was killed by a passing vehicle. Before this incident, the neighborhood wasn’t that well known by people, but this caused the media’s attention to turn towards Lindenwood. There were protests due to the fact that it was a racially charged incident. 00:11:16 During Penny’s childhood, there were many trees, swamps, playgrounds and many places to run around freely. These places have since been replaced with buildings and other manmade objects. 00:12:07 Penny hopes that Lindenwood stays the same in the years to come. She describes this part of Queens as “nice and pretty” and would like it to stay that way. ",
  "Arcabascio_Frank_timecode.txt": "Frank Arcabascio: Italian American, hair salon owner (owns Redken Saloon Salon on 30th Ave). Talks about his progression from working in his cousins' barbershop sweeping the floor etc., to owning his own salon that specializes in hair extensions. Now lives in Long Island. Talks about how Astoria's always been a ''transient\" neighborhood in terms of people moving here who can't afford to live in Manhattan -main difference now is the cafes/nightlife, so that people living in Manhattan may come for a night out here. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A Year in the Life of a Street\" project. Transcript notes for research My name is Frank Arcabascio and I'm a resident of Jackson Heights I Astoria all my life. I started off on Astoria Boulevard, at Joseph's hair place on 29th Street. Eventually I opened up my own store on Steinway street in 1981, and in 1993 I came to the present location which is 37th Street and 30th Avenue. It used to be a lawyers' office here. They were the lawyers for Astoria Federal. When they went out so did their lawyers. And you think the recession's bad now. In '93 the recession was horrible. We were able to do it with no money down. And we did through the owners because they couldn't get rid of it. In my mind the thing that comes first when I think of 30th Ave is the salon. But also the business community. The people. And the cafes. That's the new thing that comes to your mind. It's a fun place to be. In 93 there were no cafes. There were a lot of delicatessens and dry cleaners and you know, just that's the way New York was then. Recently I was in Central Park and we were in the West side by Strawberry fields. And we came out of that and wanted to find a cafe to sit down and eat outside. And we didn't find any. I started to realize. I thought since when does 30th Avenue beat Columbus Avenue, or Amsterdam Avenue? I want people to be proud of how many nice things we have and how down to earth it still is. It's a transient area. If you cannot afford to live in Manhattan you eventually find your way to Astoria. That's the life of the neighborhood, it's the young people. It's always been this way. People think oh all of a sudden people from Manhattan are starting to live in Astoria. I've been working in Astoria since 1971. There were always people living here who couldn't afford Manhattan. Actors, actresses, artists. They always live in this community. Now it's just become a little more commercial with the cafes. A place where someone from Manhattan might come and visit and hang out. Years ago it was only people living here who worked in the city. Now it's become like an alternative to the meatpacking, they come for the cafes. 30th Ave Business Association: The way it started was a few years ago we wanted to have holiday lighting in the streets. Everybody was asked to chip in and not everybody would contribute. I had an opportunity to have a festival on the street, and everyone who sponsors the festival -$6-7000, we use that for the Christmas lights. So usually the festival pays for the Christmas lights and we didn't ask anyone for money for lights any more. The Association started in 1999. My own kids aren't that interested in my business but my nieces do work here. I now live in Long Island and my kids grew up there. Even though I grew up here and started a business here and now work here 5, 6 days a week, they didn't grow up here. Two of them are going to college -they're probably going to go into the corporate world and jump into Manhattan. But they want to live in Astoria. I own this building and they're going to take the apartment upstairs. So they don't want to work in Astoria but they want to live here. I knew very young that I wanted to be a hairdresser. My cousin that I worked for, I used to sweep and clean up to make tips, I used to shine shoes. I knew early on the power of a good haircut. It was funny because the salon I first worked in was a very blue collar barbershop. You would see men walk in filthy dirty. I'd wash their hair. Then from the neck up my cousins would transform these guys. Between trimming their moustache, their beards, their haircut. And they'd walk out looking amazing. Many of them like I said, blue collar construction workers. And they were very early in the field with the unisex thing, and always going to seminars. And they kept progressing. And as a young kid I was like \"yeah, let's go to a different hairshow in the city, or visit other salons.\" (It's called Joseph's hair place, it's actually still there). So the idea of transforming a person is so powerful. They'd come in looking oh, terrible and they'd walk out looking like Clark Gable sometimes. I like long hair. I can give people long hair. In the past you could only cut hair. That kind of transformed my career. About 10 years ago I took courses in Great Lengths Hair Extensions. We were one of the few doing it. I didn't know it, but we started getting outsourced on the salons that didn't want to lose the clients, so we developed accounts. We have over 18 accounts that we do hair extensions for. I'm in Manhattan now two days a week -four in Astoria and two in Manhattan -if I were in Manhattan I'd go nuts, and likewise if I were in Astoria alone. Nuts in Manhattan because they have a lot of money, they are very high-powered career people and are very demanding. That's not the problem because I like parameters. But on 30th Ave in Astoria you're considered an authority, more on an even playing field. When you're in the city you're more of a service person, unless you're in one of the top places. I think we're all equal and we just choose to do different things. You don't just work on hair you work on a person. So it's fun to ask a person what are the highlights of their hair, what they like, their best haircuts, their worst haircuts, what's going to make them happy now. And achieving those things. I can see someone's head of hair and you immediately see what you can do on it. But that's what I want to do ... sometimes the person wants a fantasy idea and don't have the hair for it. That's where you learn diplomacy and tact. In 2002-4 I was also president of the business association and I called up Barnes and Nobel and asked them about putting one up here on 30th Avenue. They said they can't. The stores are too small. They need 10,000 square feet. 2,000 which is the largest size along here -many of them are 400 or 500 square feet -most mom and pop stores and family businesses operate in that space range. The franchises want a much larger space range. That's not to say you don't have to do the newest and latest. Like we use Facebook and Twitter. You have to embrace the new technology but it's still a family business embracing it. I use a brand -Redken -to get the attention, but I'm still a family business. Redken themselves would only be on Fifth Avenue. I took Redken to 30th Avenue. So a family will bring in new ideas, trendy ideas and can change on a dime. A franchise has a corporate bureaucracy. But the answer re changing in 10 years .... lt will be more polished, more interesting trendy businesses and cafes maybe. ",
  "Arcuri_Vincent_timecode.txt": "Unlike many of his contemporaries, Vincent Arcuri, Jr. has spent practically his whole life in Glendale, NY. This locale and its surrounding areas form the backdrop for many happy memories, from playing ball and attending dance halls to hanging out in local bars�bonafide family establishments in those days�and enjoying meals with his large Italian American clan. Mr. Arcuri forged a 40-year career in construction and had a hand in building some of NYC�s most important structures. Now retired, he continues his longtime involvement with Queens Community Board 5 and other volunteer organizations, as steadfast as ever in his conviction that civic engagement is the foundation of a strong community. 00:00:42 Queens Community Board 5 is considered �the town� and within the town are �villages�: Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth, Middle Village, etc. Within those villages are little �hamlets.� 00:02:00 Depending on section, you find either mostly one-family houses, two-family houses, or six-family houses � the �Matthews Flats.� The geography of the area and why, in a sense, it is isolated. 00:03:40 �(Glendale) was surrounded by cemeteries, with a bar or a funeral parlor around every corner.� 00:04:08 The demographic today � �probably a microcosm of Queens County, a little bit of everything.� It is still predominantly white, though. Community Board 5 could be considered the whitest district in the city � at least in Queens anyway. 00:06:51 There have been many changes over the years, but it still a family-oriented community, working class, government workers. 00:10:16 V.A.J. is a product of NYC�s public school system. He attended P.S. 91, Richmond Hill High School, and New York City Community College. 00:12:27 Graduated in June 1957 from Richmond Hill High School. Huge student population in those days meant some students went to class in an annex; crossing Jamaica Avenue, he was mugged for his lunch money regularly. Overpopulation also meant he was assigned to senior gym as a freshman. Swimming classes were separated between boys and girls. The girls were supplied with 1930s vintage bathing suits while the boys simply swam naked. 00:16:45 V.A.J. was accepted to New York City Community College. �My mother thought that was the greatest thing because I was the first in the family to go to college.� He paid for his first year in college from the nickel-a-week insurance policy that his parents took out on him when he was a baby (child mortality rates were high when he was born in 1939, so it was a big thing then). 00:18:10 Senior Prom. The white sport coat, the pink carnation. Limo to Manhattan. Ferry to Staten Island to see the Statue of Liberty. Nightclub in Brooklyn to hear Tony Bennett. Someone�s house for breakfast. Then go home, get changed, go to Rockaway Beach and sleep off the day. There�s probably only five of the old crew left in the area. Unlike his friends, except for three years in Flushing, V.A.J. spent his whole life in Glendale. 00:21:12 How he met his wife. Young people went to dances then: Triangle Ballroom in Richmond Hill, Hoffman Hall in Glendale, a few places in Ridgewood, the Jamaica YMCA� At the Sunday Social at the Cresthaven Country Club, �I met this little blonde in a nice little black dress and polished toenails, and that was that.� The dance halls are gone now. He feels sorry for today�s young people. 00:22:52 �Back then, the drinking age was 18� even though we started at 14.� There was a bar on every corner. They were all family bars. �Rushing the Growler� � there were few bottled/canned beer then, so as a boy he was sent to the pub at the corner to pick up beer in a growler, a two-quart tin pot with a cover. The bars were social places, with fishing clubs and sports teams. The local kids grew up in bars. It was natural. When they grew up and had their own families, they brought their kids to the bars too. 00:26:34 His ancestors are from Italy. His mother�s parents originated from Castelgrande and his paternal grandfather moved from Reggio Calabria. His father was a Teamster by age 14. To make extra money, Arcuri Sr. played the piano in silent movie theaters in Manhattan. The man was an entrepreneur with several ventures; by the time V.A.J. was born, the family had a gas station on Wyckoff Avenue behind the Madison Theater in Ridgewood. 00:29:40 V.A.J. is the youngest of seven children. During WWII, he was surrounded by women. This was how he learned to cook. 00:30:31 On Sundays, his mother would cook meatballs and family from all over would come to the house. �Sunday was the big red sauce meal.� His best friend was German. On Saturday, V.A.J. was at his friend�s house for a German lunch; on Sunday, his best friend would come over for some Italian. 00:32:09 �In 1944, we made the mistake of moving in in August. That was after Italy capitulated.� It was WWII and Italians were unpopular. Life was rough for the Arcuris for a few years, but his mother was one tough lady. Assimilation in this city is never complete, though. As he grew up, he realized that he was seen as an Italian, not an American. When he was starting out in construction, he was denied opportunities because of his Italian background. 00:35:55 ��You know, you�re a pretty good worker. For an Italian.�� 00:36:12 After a runaround, he gets his break. �He didn�t care if you were black, pink, yellow, orange, male or female � so long as you were working.� At Turner Construction Company back then, contracting was a WASP-y business, but he got in because of his skills with concrete. Prejudice never really went away. 00:39:35 He retired on December 31st, 2001, after participating in the WTC cleanup. �I can tell you I�m one of the few people who reached their childhood ambition.� V.A.J. was involved in a number of famous projects, including the Lipstick Building, Trump Village in Coney Island, and 323 Broadway. His kids were present at every project that he ever built. 00:43:56 He has four children. Two stayed in Queens (one lives down the block), while the other two are in Maryland and California. Four grandchildren are all over. Most went to college. All are doing well. �Not bad for a dumb Italian laborer.� 00:46:47 He serves as chairman of Queens Community Board 5. He also chairs the transportation committee, which is one of the busiest committees. Right now the biggest issue he deals with is the City wants to put a homeless shelter in an industrial area, next to a chemical plant. Busy with infrastructure projects. 00:50:58 What he�s proudest of in his long career with the CB5. From a dirty, dangerous area in the 1970s, the community is one of the cleanest and safest in Queens. 00:53:21 You can see how important civic engagement is in this community. �If one community fails, all of us fail.� This is why he is involved in so many organizations. The origins of G-COP as a civilian patrol, his participation in the Knights of Columbus, the Boy Scouts, Greater Ridgewood Historical Society, Myrtle Avenue Business Improvement District� 00:59:26 He thought Queens, this community in particular, was so special because everybody knew everybody, or used to. Now it�s starting to be that way again. 01:00:40 One strength of these communities is the people who emigrated from Gottschee, Germany. Original settlers in Ridgewood in the 1800s. Strong and hard-working people. Like V.A.J., they don�t leave either. They�re a hit with the hipsters too, who are bringing their own businesses into town. 01:05:15 He doesn�t play ball anymore, but he still considers himself a typical Glendale man. He walks down the street and notices everything. In this town, when an ambulance passes by, everybody opens their window to look. 01:06:01 He was raised by his parents to be independent and responsible. As a boy, he walked to school with his friends, went to the playground afterwards, and when they heard the train go by they knew that it was time to come home for dinner. 01:08:43 V.A.J. was honored with awards and recognitions by different organizations.

  "Armistead_Austin_timecode.txt": "Rev. Austin Armistead was born on December 30, 1924 in New Hampshire. He was raised in different parts of New Hampshire and finally settled in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. His father was a minister who served in World War I. Mr. Armistead followed in his father�s footsteps by serving in World War II. While serving, his best friend was killed in battle thirty feet away from him. He witnessed many of those who were considered �politically incorrect� die during the war. Witnessing these horrific events as well as strong influence from his mother led Austin to become a pastor until the age of seventy. His biggest hope for the community was to have those of diverse backgrounds work together to be a great influence not only his community of Jackson Heights but in the world. 00:00:57 Austin Armistead was born in what considered to be a �famous place�. He was born in New Hampshire on December 30, 1924. 00:04:46 Growing up, Mr. Armistead considered himself a typical child. He talked about doing many activities with his family, including going to baseball games. His family uprooted and moved to a coal mining region in Pennsylvania and then later moved to New York. 00:10:08 Rev. Armistead originally wanted to be a sports journalist or lawyer. Ironically, his last choice was to become a pastor. 00:13:12 He recalls a horrific event where his best friend was killed in the battlefield thirty feet away from him. 00:16:58 While imprisoned in Germany, Austin noticed a �code of ethics� within the prison groups. The biggest code was to not steal from fellow prisoners. This was seen as the worst thing one could do amongst inmates. 00:28:22 While serving in World War II, Mr. Armistead witnessed the eradication of those considered �politically incorrect�, particularly Jews.He couldn�t stand the thought of people being killed through no fault of their own. Through service and prompting from his mother, he decided to take a year off of college and decided he wanted to become a pastor. 00:34:42 Mr. Armistead says his worst sin was not knowing how to say �no�. He was heavily involved in many causes, including the Salvation Army. 00:41:18 Mr. Armistead notes that the biggest change he noticed in the community during his time as a pastor in Jackson Heights was the increase diversity. He says this new diversity is what �built America�. Mr. Armistead was a pastor for Community United Methodist Church in Jackson Heights and his congregation consisted of people from sixty nations. His hope for the community was for people of a wide variety of backgrounds collaborate, as opposed to one group thinking they own the �turf�. 00:47:09 Mr. Armistead defines community as hope. He hopes it is something that can be a greater influence in the world. 00:50:48 His number one advice for people is to be yourself. ",

  "Banker_Benny_timecode.txt": "Benny Banker, originally from Gujarat in India, works for the United States Postal Service and has been delivering mail along 30th Ave in Astoria for 13 years. He talks about how the work it not as tough as people may think -the really hot days or the snowstorms are only around 10 days in a year -and the importance of a positive attitude. He says that despite its financial difficulties he thinks the postal service will survive, particularly in cities. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A year in the life of a street\" project (www.30thAve.org) My name is Benny Banker. My primary job is letter carrier in Astoria station, covering most of this heart part of Astoria. Like Astoria General Hospital which is now Mount Sinai, there are a lot of doctors around here. It's a nice residential area. I've been doing it more than 13 years in this neighborhood. Actually speaking I love my job because it's a service for the people. I feel good seeing old people -when they see me they wait for me and they become so happy. If I am off like two or three days or a week, everybody feels like a family member came back after a long time. The second thing I like about the job is it's my lifesaver, because it gives me compulsory exercise every day. If I take two weeks' vacation and go for my tests, everything is elevated. To be honest the difficult and the easy thing is just your mindset. Yes, this job looks like it's hard but I think it is not that bad. Especially when people see us in the snow and the rain they feel really sorry about us. But if you talk about counting the full year of 365 days we hardly have those heat-waves and those mountains of the snow or the rain. Hardly I would say ten days. So if you can ride on through those ten days then this job is not bad. If you look at it as a challenge. Especially like tomorrow is going to be a storm -a lot of people said why don't you call in sick. I have a doctor's appointment and he said I might need to stay home and I said no, these are the days when my community needs me more. So I'm going to work. On the day when there was the biggest snowstorm I woke up at four in the morning, I walked to the subway station and I took a train and I made it here by eight o' clock, from four o'clock. I managed to work, while 80% of people they didn't make it to their work. I live very far in Queens Village, one and a half hours train ride -maybe one hour by driving. It's all up to your installation, where you work. Originally I started in Brooklyn, then there was a lot of commute. At that time I lived in Woodside and it was too much for me, the commute, so I applied for a transfer and within six months my choice area came up .I'd chosen Long Island City. I applied for this route here and I got it. I was born in India, in Gujarat. I was not even married when I came here. Then in 1977 I went back to my country, got married and came back here. I have three kids -two sons are doctor and one is in business management. One is a pediatrician in Houston, another is a GI in Stonybrook and my daughter still got married and she's still with me until her husband comes back. All these small complexes are turning into multiple buildings which creates a parking problem mainly. Before we used to find any time and we used to find parking, and not anymore. We have to struggle for the parking. Like every other business the post office is also in the midst of hardship but I personally don't think that's a serious problem. People do need to mail a letter. The parcels and things are to my calculation I think they will survive and I don't think we need to think \"oh my God.\" Every business has a right to save the money and they are trying but what Basically we used to have a lot of first class mail before. Now we have more junk mail but even that one is decreasing. But it's not stopping, people still mail things like lawyers documents and everything, they still have to have a hard copy. What I say is think positive you 're going to get positive. If you think negative, you 're like inviting negative stuff by just thinking negative. I do a lot of web designing on the side. I have websites for my mother's memory http://www.virendra.net/kkamuba, for my community http://www.22493.com that meets every week for the prayers (we have a block party every year), I have my union's website, and I pretty much enjoy doing that.

  "Bararata_Gabriela_timecode.txt": "I wake up early in the morning, up at 5:00 AM, when the break of dawn is coming through my window. I brush my teeth, fix my hair and do my morning prayers (I�m Buddhist), I put on my oversized headphones. On my way to the train station I pass Dunkin Donuts. There is always a line, no matter the time of the day. I take the 7 train to Midtown Manhattan, where I work as a hostess at a Greek Diner. I spend nine hours of my day, six days a week there, but I think about coming back to my neighborhood and how much I like it there almost all the time. On this particular morning I have a cup of coffee and read New York Magazine. I come across an article about the best neighborhoods in New York City. And there you are, Sunnyside! You are number three! Automatically my competitive side kicks in, and I start showing the article to my coworkers. Some of the waitresses are Greek and live in Astoria. They think their neighborhood is better than Sunnyside, even though Astoria only makes number eleven on the list. On my way back to Sunnyside I start making a list of things I have to do when I get home. One of them is doing my laundry, one of my most dreadful duties, but there is no escape. It�s either doing laundry today or buying new clothes tomorrow. When I get off the train, I see the �churro lady� (churros are pastries that look similar to cannolis from South and Central America). Across the street is the Taco truck. Yummy, me love some taco please! The fruit guy is also there. I say �hi� and think about how these images of people on the street make Sunnyside familiar to me. On my way to the laundry, I walk through the park. Two ladies are looking at a tree, talking about some special bird that lives there and sings beautifully. (Well, maybe not that beautifully at 5:00 AM�). A couple of small children are playing with the colorful water hoses. The bigger kids are shooting hoops, and everybody seems to enjoy the pleasant spring afternoon. The fancy, renovated library is right across the park. It welcomes all residents. As I take my laundry out of the dryer, I notice that all the dryers are very old but still function very well. I was reading the ads on the board out of boredom, when I notice a flyer advertising �The Sunnyside Sound Project.� I take some pictures with my camera phone and decide to start writing about my day. I think about what makes a neighborhood good. There are many factors, but the most important one is its people. Its people make a neighborhood happy, pleasant and successful. While the buildings and the scenery of a city can be breathtaking, it is the people who make a neighborhood valuable. People who own small businesses and who don�t give up, despite the crazy economy and terrorist threats. People who are raising their family here, creating new value for the next generation. I particularly love this neighborhood because it is my little piece of the world. It is where I come to relax after a hard day of work. ",
  "Barker_Keri_timecode.txt": "Keri Barker, 27, is originally from Seattle. She is an artist, and works as a fitness instructor at Planet Fitness to pay the bills. Her goal is to save enough money to buy a condo in Astoria within 10 years -she feels totally at home here. She talks about the inspiration for her art, the artistic community in Astoria, gay-friendly venues, and places she likes to go out at night. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A year in the life of a street\" project (www.30thAve.org). Transcript notes for research I'm Keri Barker. For a living I work right now at Planet Fitness to pay the bills. But my passion is to paint. I'm a fine oil painter. And I'm aspiring to be a screenwriter as well. I'm originally from Seattle. When I was about five I demanded from my mom why we didn't live in New Jersey. I had no explanation. I was just like I want to live in New Jersey. My whole East Coast thing never went away. Then I was 22 and working for a computer company and it was a dead-end job to say the least. I had some friends from college who always knew I wanted to live out here. My college roommate sent me a text message saying I have some friends who moved to New York and one of them is leaving to Alaska and needs someone to take over his room. Would you be interested? The room was $465 a month, in Inwood. A week after I moved here, the guy whose room I took over was like \"hey, I have this job at NYU for their musical theater company CAP21\". He said maybe you can get the job. I sent them my resume and never heard anything back from them until he'd moved. Then they gave me a call -they interviewed me and hired me and I started my job a week after I got here. And perhaps a month later my lead bosses, the two who owned the company, asked me about my work. They said \"could you redesign our lobby?\" They're a husband and wife team and the wife loved my work. I hand-painted on the door the words \"The Shop\" which was the name of the theater. And they gave me a display wall to put up any work I wanted for as long as I was working there. I left the job to pursue other things -it was kind of a college job. I'd got a job in an art company shipping art. I thought that would inspire me but instead it did just the opposite. Like I'm shipping other people's art but I'm an artist, and I want to be the one whose art is being shipped. So I got back with one of my bosses at CAP and said I have this body of work -I had 10 of them, paintings of hands -and I had this photograph series that I'd done of all the big statues in Calvary Cemetery. I had come out of a really kind of dark time in my life and thought I kind of want to do this art show about loss, and death. I named it \"death in life.\" In finding the cemetery with all these beautiful statues I was like \"there's a lot of life\" that can come out of death. The hand paintings were inspired by my one and only girlfriend. We were together for three years and she was a schizophrenic and very sick. Towards the end she took a really bad turn for the worse. For me the only way that I could sort of deal with what was happening and the intensity of the relationship was to paint. And it's weird for me how I manifested that by painting these hands, because hands to me have a lot of life, they're very human. It was such a traumatic relationship, I loved her so much and wanted her to be healthy but she was undeniably sick. And it was my first introduction to the fact that mental illness is difficult, painful, hard to deal with and look into the eyes of. I was so young at the time and when I met her I didn't know that was what I would be dealing with. That was in Seattle. I contacted NYU and my old boss was like sure, we'll let you have a show in the theater. I thought perhaps they'd give me a rehearsal studio, but they gave me the whole theater for a night. They said we'll hook up all the lights so that there are spotlights on the pieces, it was very fancy. They even let me have food in there. They said because you used to work here and you cleaned so well, we trust that you will clean up afterwards spotlesslessly! I moved to Astoria very whimsically. I moved here in May of2006. I had met somebody at the theater who worked in the program, who was like \"I'm from Podunk Washington\", and I was like \"I'm from Podunk Washington too.\" I'm from South of Seattle, this town called Auburn, and she's from Federal Way -they're neighboring towns. We started hanging out and she happened to live in Astoria. One evening I came out to visit her here on Broadway and I just instantly fell in love with the area. I just thought this area is beautiful. I don't know anything about it but I just had such an amazingly good vibe. I came here late in the evening. But the street was still lively, there were so many lights. And the people seemed friendly. It didn't feel in any way sketchy or unnerving. And this was at 12, 1 in the morning. Whereas when I lived in Spanish Harlem we tended not to leave our apartment after 11. Just because it didn't feel right, you know. A few months later when I had an opportunity coming up for a lease coming up in Spanish Harlem I decided on Astoria. I got here before I really knew about the arts community here. I got here and started making all my friends here, making my life here and now I hardly even leave. It's amazing the arts community. At one time I and another artist have talked about having an Astoria arts thing going so that we can be more exposed. It's in the works among my artist friends, we just haven't got there yet. I hang out with a lot of both straight and gay people. The gay scene isn't terrible in Astoria. But I do find most of my dates on OK Cupid because it's easier that way. I know that Crescent Lounge is gay-friendly, and there are definitely other some bars around here that are too. The Hell Gate Social Club, that's the place that I frequent a lot. It was one of those environments that just suited me. I'm not a big nightlife person, I like my comfy-cozy know-everybody can go on the nights of the week type place. I like Broadway Station, I like Break. I like places where you can go and have something to do, people to meet. I'm always genuinely surprised by how diverse Astoria is. I tend to paint mostly on sheer inspiration. Part of the reason I left the art company was it was taking up so much of my time and stressing me out, and ironically I was being paid very far below average for the position I was in. Then they put a wage freeze on. I realized that I was living in a place (on 30th Ave) with reasonable rent because our landlady loves us and its rent stabilized, and you know, I'm at a moment in my life when I can get a job that's definitely more conducive to being able to do art. So that's why I got the job at Planet Fitness. It's probably the most stress-free job you can imagine. I love working out. It's only 30 hours a week but it's enough to pay the bills -I go there from 9 to 3 and get off and my day is so full. I paint in the evenings and on the weekends. These Heaven landscapes I did last year. The year changes and my inspiration changes. So then almost at the flip of the year I was like I can't do those landscapes any more, and started to do these weird block paintings that I have right here in the kitchen. These two paintings are two I found on the streets of Astoria. One I found face-down in the snow and picked it up. My roommate then thought it was one of mine. Then I found this one in front of an auto-shop. I started painting in 2002. Some paintings can take me three days, or a week. But sometimes I could do two in a day. I got to a point with the hand paintings when the inspiration started to come out really fast. That's one of my favorite things about painting. I'm not sure where it's going to go. But I have an inner confidence that when I have a canvas and a paintbrush in my hand it will end up looking exactly as it's supposed to. Almost every time I step back I think it's better than I could have ever imagined. There isn't a single one that I haven't been surprised by. This soldier painting -it's based on a black and white photo, I felt I akin to that soldier, I felt like I could feel what he was feeling. I love the peacefulness of it, really. My preferred time to paint is when I'm alone in the apartment. It puts me into this centeredness, calmness, this sense of peace. At the same time my mind might race with thoughts, that I feel that I'm supposed to just go over because I'm not concentrating on them. Almost like I can be an objective observer to my thought process. And in a way it's almost like it just brings me peace and clarity. The only frustration I have is ifl don't have inspiration or I loose inspiration. Or I just come to the end of a series and know that I'm done. I have a deep fascination with hands. It stems from those old drying pads with colored construction paper. On that was a sketched hand with a pencil. My dad was an artist and when I was a kid I used to find his tablets and sketchpads. He was the most amazing artist and I would never be as good as him. He was mostly pencil and charcoal sketcher. I thought I'll never be as good but I'll always try. I remember seeing those pads and thinking \"I want to draw my hand, drawing something. I did that, and drew my hand, drew my hand, drew my hand. The idea of drawing a hand is very complex. I haven't taken many art classes but I did in high school and I took one in community college, and it's amazing how art teachers will focus a lot on the difficulty of hands. So very early on I had a fascination with them. And thought \"well it's difficult so I'm going to try doing it.\" And for me there's just so much life in them. It's what gives me life, and I couldn't paint without them. My parents do support what I do. They think I'm crazy as an artist, though they think it's great. They think it's great that I try so hard and have had shows etc. But they know it doesn't make much money. They're also of the sort to be like, \"are you going to get a real job one day?\" I'm 27 now. I recently put into effect with myself that I have a ten year plan of I want to save as much money as possible so that I can buy a condo here in Astoria by the time I'm 37. That's my goal. I love it here so much. When I lived in Washington State I lived in four different towns there, and then I lived in Ventura California for a brief amount of time (I'm not a fan of California). And then in New York, much as I like Manhattan, when I came to Astoria it just felt like home. And even my hometown doesn't feel as much like home as this place. So I feel I could settle here, I could live my life here, be very happy here. I like the accessibility. Everything I could want is here in Astoria, or if it's not in Astoria it's a quick trip to Manhattan, or down to Coney Island (I like Coney Island). But so much is here in Astoria. I love going to the bowling alley and hanging out, I love playing pool, love the fact that my friends are all here, that there are comedy shows and open mic nights, and all the food you could imagine. People are so accommodating and friendly. I talk to my 85 year-old-neighbor downstairs in the bodega all the time. He's like \"hey doll-face, how are you doing today?\" Ron [roommate], he's been in Astoria for six years and he and I have been roommates for almost four years. We're amazed at all the condos popping up on 21st Street. It's changing around here, that's for sure. But it's good for a place to grow. And I pay $475, my roommates pay $575, we've been here for two years and the landlady is like we won't raise it for two more years if you guys stay. That's the thing about this area. There are a lot of old families. Her mom owns this building. Her brother in law owns the coin shop downstairs. That's still for me a big feeling in Astoria. In face all the three places I've lived in Astoria have been family-owned homes. That's a comfort, when you're not dealing with hundreds of tenants, a superintendent, a landlord who doesn't even know who you are. Also given we have the airport the buildings can't get too high. The more diverse it gets, it will still keep its culture. Walking around here you see how multi-cultural it is. As long as people continue to stay true to that, respect that, Astoria will stay the way it is now. Planet Fitness has lots of people muscle-building so people are not worried about their weight. It really accommodates to people in the neighborhood, heavy-set, not heavy-set, first time gym users, honestly, I really enjoy my time there. I get my daily workout just by being at work. I get paid to stay healthy and be fit. A lot of people get paid to sit behind a desk and then they have to work in time to do that. For me, I get paid to stay healthy. Then in my spare time I'm free to do my true pursuits which is writing and painting. ",
  "Barrett_Ramon_timecode.txt": "This interview discusses Laurelton�s history as well as Roman Barrett�s personal history of his community involvement in Laurelton. Barrett first came to Laurelton, Queens in the 1970s and has witnessed considerable changes occurring in this neighborhood and elsewhere in Queens. Additionally, Barrett became an active member in several groups that strove to save Queens, mainly through political means, and touches upon his family life. 00:00:54* First lived in Laurelton then moved to Forest Hills and then moved permanently back to Laurelton after seeing homes for sale, what were called �Cinderella� houses available: it�s said to be a suitable place for retirement. 00:01:13 Barrett refers to change in Laurelton as a �Cinderella,� �rags to riches,� story in which the homes were decayed after Green Acres shopping mall opened up, causing local businesses to leave for the mall area. 00:01:35 Combination of Brooklyn (Union) Gas and Dime Savings Bank pulled resources together financially, bought and built the houses (�Cinderella� houses) 00:02:10 Moved in �Cinderella� home with wife, 1978. 00:02:22* When he came to Laurelton, it was consisted of about 75% Caucasian and 25% other. Demographic changed because African-Americans & Caribbean people moved in. Barrett believes Caucasians felt their �equity� (value) was above blacks, so when asked, real estate brokers told them to move. 00:03:10 Italians and Jewish people lived in Laurelton before Barrett moved there. 00:03:17* The Synagogues that were sold when the Jews moved out, are now owned by the Seventh Day Adventists. The Catholic Church stayed. 00:03:45 The Jewish community kept the cemetery over by 120th-130th Ave. on Francis Louis Blvd, where they have their famous rabbi buried. 00:04:38 �Cinderella� houses are town houses: 13 were built; each contained 2-3 bedrooms with its own spacing. 00:06:27* As a typical resident, Barrett stated, �I�m here to stay. I�m not leaving.� 00:06:38 Neighborhood has dense population; because of retirees and those who are buying homes at inflated rates but having to get renters because of the great expenses 00:06:51 The reconstruction of homes was to enable renters to live in the homes. 00:07:50* He was part of the block association, block association was held on 230th Place-225th Street. 00:08:03* A year after joining his block association, he became president of the Laurelton Federation, which covers all the blocks in Laurelton. 00:08:14* Term of Office had ended, but he enjoyed it and most of the politicians who were coming to gain exposure because of Barrett who gave them a platform for them to pitch their elections, talks, and much more. These politicians were able to get most of the things they needed done; Barrett and his colleagues made connections through politicians, even the Police provided them with protection. 00:09:10 During his term as president, there was an attempt to move drugs into the community. 00:09:12* At the time, there was drug war that got a little out of control. They did a study and there was a shooting on Merrick Blvd. Drug dealer from Sutphin Blvd. area wanted to come into Laurelton to establish a base, unknown to Barrett and his party, and there was a fight going on, a �cold war,� a shooting for territorial rights. 00:09:55* But it became too unbearable so Barrett and colleagues called in all the different segments of government, the police, community board, Borough Commander, and all politicians in the neighborhood. 00:10:13 They all met and drew up plans and developed strategies to get and keep drug dealers out. 00:10:27 Whatever property was owned by those who bought or intended to buy drugs, was confiscated. Politicians angled to get the property from them before they could move in to the neighborhood. 00:10:47* Barrett was the first one to set up a march in Queens. When he started the march, someone who lived on his block, who knew one of the drug dealers, told her that if she was not living so close to Barrett, they would have burnt his home. 00:11:17 He called the D.A.�s office after hearing this and met with the Assistant D.A. They investigated and offered valuable protection. 00:11:38 This occurred in the 1980s; Queens D.A. was John Santucci. 00:11:53* Had pictures with Floyd Flake, than Congressman who was over Barrett�s community and lived in Laurelton for a while; who also is the Pastor of Greater Allen AME Cathedral on Merrick Blvd. 00:12:25* Picture of Donald Manes, who was Borough President at the time who wanted to meet with minority leaders (in which 4 showed up, Barrett included), to discuss what he would love to do for them if they needed help. 00:12:54 Unfortunately, he was not there: shortly after the meeting, he changed his address with no number/phoning address, (suicide). 00:13:23* Barrett worked on Wall Street at Citibank: public transportation was very ideal, easy and cheap. 00:14:26* Residents, try to attend churches, some go out of Laurelton to worship: others stay within the community to worship. 00:14:56 Barrett�s church in Laurelton: Rose Sinclair�s Room. 00:15:10 The area�s religion is a mixture of Roman Catholic, Methodist, Assembly, Pentecostal. 00:15:30 His children were not brought up or born in his current house. 00:15:38* School system was very good and his children were born and raised in Brooklyn, went from elementary to college. 00:16:00 One of his sons got into Brooklyn Tech and from there went to City College, eventually obtaining a Master�s Degree in Engineering. 00:16:11 Barrett�s last daughter was the first to enter Brooklyn Tech when it became co-educational. She graduated, has a PH.D, and is Assistant D.A. in charge of the Nursing Dept. 00:16:37 His two boys are doing very well, one is an engineer; the other a high-tech individual who Barrett states is very popular and knowledgeable. 00:17:55 A principal in Andrew Jackson High School (now Campus Magnet) a friend to Barrett had taught and still teaches at LaGuardia College. 00:18:22* Laurelton is the best kept neighborhood in the city, Barrett and his neighbors held block beautification; one year they had tulips all over Laurelton, and with another year, impatience and so on. 00:18:45* At Christmas time, they had contest of judging the lawns and lighting of the houses. The award given was a little cup given by the block captain (each block had its own awards ceremony, which varies as to what time they want it done). 00:20:15 No parks around Laurelton, but one was on the South Conduit, closed because of the drug infestation and is now being used for storage. Others use Roy Wilkins Park over on Merrick and Baisley Blvd. 00:21:07 Brookville Park in Rosedale has a tennis court off 47th/147th Ave. on Farmer�s Blvd. 00:21:33 Barrett did some gardening but it was so tedious and time-consuming, so he passed it on to someone who could do a better job than him; hired a gardener who did everybody�s lawn. (Recently, the gardener came yesterday at the time of this interview.) 00:22:10* When Barrett was gardening, flowers and vegetables were done to a limit; after waiting a while, he just went to store to buy them and materials to plant. 00:22:34* Always felt that if he couldn�t get certain work done, �give it to the person who is more qualified� than him and then pay them for that. 00:22:49 In the future, he is confident Laurelton will remain at peace and in place or better because there is more concern by homeowners as to bettering or ensuring that the neighborhood is kept up. 00:23:05 He believes there will be more beautification, more developing, houses will be more maintained. 00:23:22 Sewer lines and water way will be fixed in order to get the water flooding taken care of: a bigger concern happened a couple years ago from Springfield Blvd. to Laurelton, where they had wet rains and basements were over-flooded.

She ends the interview with a message to all Latino Americans and the innate strength we have as Latinos living in the United States. 00:00:25 Raquel tells us that she is Colombian. She was born in Medellin but grew up in Periera which is in the Risalrada department of Colombia. (Colombia is divided into 14 departments which are essentially states or districts.) 00:00:50 Raquel discusses her job in Colombia. She had a good job in working for Risalrada�s government. She had a son and lived pretty well in Colombia 00:01:05 She discusses the fact that she ran into some money problems while living in Colombia. She began to accumulate debt because she purchased a house and her son was about to start college and she was helping out her sister who was unemployed. 00:01:55 She felt that she was drowning under the weight of her. Her friend that worked with her in Colombia told her to move to the United States and that she would have a place to stay if she came to New York. 00:02:30 Raquel discusses how she applied for a visa through her job and she discusses that it was technically very easy to get a visa. She had many friends who obtained visas because they worked for the government. She came to the United States alone because she didn�t want to interrupt her son�s studies. 00:03:07 Raquel details her original intentions of coming to the United States and that her vision was to only be here for five years and then return to Colombia. She thought she would obtain money she needed to pay off her debts. She then planned on returning to her family. She also stated she didn�t want to stay in the United States without proper documentation. 00:03:50 She recalls having many people tell her how easy it was to get proper documentation. The usual method was to get married which resulted in obtaining residency papers immediately. Raquel explains that this was not the case and the truth of getting residency papers was an arduous process. 00:04:45 Raquel came with her visa and was first permitted a six months stay. She details her first impression of New York City. She goes into detail describing the airport she landed at and how Roosevelt Ave looked in Flushing, and where her friend lived. 00:05:44 Raquel details her account of the city as a person that came from the farm in Colombia. She explains that she didn�t even realize how extensive New York City was until she went to Manhattan. 00:06:29 Raquel explains her first job in a restaurant as a cashier in Jackson Heights. She explains that the job was difficult because she was not accustomed to the fast pace movement in Queens. 00:07:55 She was overwhelmed at her new job but she preserved so she could send remittances to her family in Colombia 00:08:10 She recalls a funny story while she was working in the restaurant. She needed to make juices using a blender and because of her nerves. She put everything in the blender and forgot to close it and turned it on. She told the customer that the blender was broken and was afraid that she�d get fired. She laughs about that moment to this day 00:09:00 She discusses her coworkers and friends and that she was very excited to meet people from other countries. Before coming to American she had never met anyone that was not Colombian.

She said that the rent was too expensive but that food you could find some type of food for cheap i.e. soup. 00:12:25 Raquel�s friend told her that he obtained his residency papers within a year. He explained that he used to work in politics and the government and applied for asylum. So Raquel asked for asylum and obtained her residency paper because at the time Colombia countryside was plagued by guerilla warfare. 00:13:50 Raquel explains that she received her documents and ended up staying in the United States for twelve years. She also discusses that she wanted to learn English in order to get a job that was not so physically demanding. 00:14:40 She explains the barrier that she faced trying to find a job that didn�t have someone that spoke Spanish. This was a barrier because she never practiced English because all her co-workers in Queens usually spoke Spanish so naturally they communicated in Spanish to each other. 00:15:50 Raquel explains her attempt to get a better education. She said that she went into a school that wouldn�t give her any accreditation and realized that she was supposed to go to college. She was not happy about this situation but ended up studying in CUNY through government assistance. 00:17:30 She began working at a Colombian export business.

She did not find a job while out there and she became very frightened about her responsibilities and her inability to send money to her son in Colombia. She explains it was a very hard time for her. She ended up returning back to Queens after three months out in Long Island. 00:20:30 Raquel returned to Queens to the room that she was subletting from another woman. However, when she returned she found out that the woman went to Colombia for a time and was not there to receive her. She was very distraught at this point because she came with no money and did not know where to sleep. 00:21:37 She began to think about the thought of being homeless and she began to pray. She looked for the woman and ended up talking to another person of the building. She recognized Raquel and told her that her landlady was not in New York.

She also explains that her old supervisor contacted her because he had a crush on her and asked her to return to work in New Jersey. Then he changed his mind and said there was no job. 00:31:40 She came back to New York and began working in a hotel as a maid for a couple of months.

She feels that this is visible especially when it concerns families. She compares children from Latin American countries are being dependent on their families. In contrast children in the United States are raised to be more and are more independent. 01:14:00 She discusses how she feels about the fact that American children begin working at a very young age while other Latin America countries refuse to let children work at a such a young age. She believes that children should not be working. They should enjoy their childhood and study. She feels that�s children should start working when they are eighteen years old. 01:17:00 She discusses the cultural differences between a Colombian and Mexican, and why she did not marry a Colombian like she was advised to do. She tells the story of a Colombian boyfriend that became a complicated relationship. She doesn�t feel a need to marry someone that is also Colombian. 01:36:00 She discusses that the people who come from Central American countries tend to be more humble and have a better attitude regarding life. She feels that others tend to be more agitated or quick to anger. She feels that people need to be open to everyone�s culture and feelings. 01:41:00 She finishes her interview with her thoughts about immigrants, specifically with Central and Latin America. She discusses the way Latinos are unfairly treated and looked down upon. She feels that as a nation of immigrants it is time to unite and stand together against the discrimination that has been going on in the United States. ",

  "Boes_JeanneMarie_timecode.txt": "Jeanne Marie Boes, 23, is a singer-songwriter who was born and brought up in Astoria. She attended Frank Sinatra School of the Arts and says she would go back to that time if she could. She says that more live music venues are opening up in Astoria; on 30th Ave she has played in the Quays and the Shillelagh Tavern. Her inspirations include the musicians she heard in her home when she was growing up -Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Ella FitzGerald. Context of interview: \"30th Ave -A year in the life of a street\" project ( www. 3 OthA ve. org). Transcript notes for research My name is Jeanne Marie Boes, and I am a singer, songwriter and musician. I live along 30th Avenue. For a while I lived near Newton Road, and now for about 11, 12 years I've been on 30th. I was born and raised in Astoria. As of late there has been a stronger musical community, because they are all starting to realize that there are bars and restaurants right here that are looking for live music, rather than running to Manhattan. There are definitely increasing places where peo~le can play. Here I've played at the Quays and the Shillelagh Tavern, both directly on 30' . I was kind of born and raised on Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Ella FitzGerald, so I kind of lean towards that kind of music. We had a keyboard, some kind of Casio. And I was like hey, that's fun, and I would play around with it. Around that time they said well you like it, maybe you should take music lessons. I have always leaned towards music. I went to Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. I graduated in 2006. And I've kind of been winging it since, trying to make it. What's difficult about it is gaining exposure, that's the hardest thing. What's fun is meeting other musicians and meeting the audiences who enjoy what you are playing. Really just making people smile. I mean if they walk away happy of what they heard ... I play the blues. I have my upbeat songs, my ballads. I guess that's funny though that I'd say they walk away happy! So I guess, walk away having enjoyed, maybe. I write by myself and I collaborate. When I say the challenge is getting exposure, it's to agents and producers, but also just to a bigger audience. When I'm not performing I'm trying to do the social network thing, and that's difficult at times too. It's definitely friendly [the music community in Astoria]. The non-friendly ones don't usually get far! I know a lot of very, very nice people. Two words I'd use to describe Astoria? I'd want to say \"emerging\". I mean just businesses alone, all these new cafes, new restaurants. And \"inspiring\". Astoria is gorgeous, I love it. I can see myself staying here as long as I can, before I move to my dream loft in the village. But until then, this is a nice place. I think there were fewer restaurants here when I was a child. It's possible that I just wasn't going to them at that age. But 30'h, Broadway and Steinway, it just seems like it's really booming. Lots of my high school friends are still in the neighborhood. Here and also in Flushing, and all over the place. There's a place on Broadway I like going to ... sort oflike a restaurant, bar, bakery ... Omonia Cafe. I'm trying to think on 30th ... quite close to 30th there's Mini Star Diner. My family and the owners are really great friends from way back. Getting Greek salads and things. Originally my family is German, French, well French Canadian, Irish and Italian. The part of being a musician I enjoy the most is creating the music. I'm big on melody. I don't know just coming out with a tune and flopping out some chords, that's my thing. [Inspiration comes from] other music, that's the biggest. Already counting Frank Sinatra and those, I do like Billy Holiday. The Beatles and Billy Joel. Earlier this year I brought out an EP, that's five songs, it's called Promising Girl. [After releasing it, go about] promoting it by playing tons and tons of shows, everywhere possible. Online, you know, Facebook, emails. But yeah, just playing the songs. I'm not a morning person! When I finally do wake up I check my email. .. I'm really just always looking for places I can play ... promoting my music. And then in the evenings playing. I would love to play every night, that would be a dream. I mean if I could make a living doing this. I just do basic paperwork stuff [to earn money]. I have performed in Manhattan. I was very, very fortunate to have played at WNYC radio -they have this new space and they were having this contest. I happened to get into this finalist group. And I played in this room, it was the Jerome L Green space. And I was like \"oh my God this is right next door to WNYC radio\", which is, I mean they are the home of one of my favorite radio stations, WQXR. It's weird because I listen to a lot of pop music, but classical is great too. And I have played a lot of bars and cafes. And Tavern on the Green, it was kind of a Summer Festival thing. So I've had some luck, but it's hard. Manhattan is definitely more competitive. But also there is a lot going for you there and you have a lot of chances. I can only imagine why. Queens is a great starting point ... I mean I'm not putting it down ... but I would give it a couple of years and it might be a great place for it to be a good next step point. It's hard for me to pick a favorite song. But I know that people have loved certain ones. I mean one of my new ones is called \"If it's goodbye\". It's out of a couple of mine in which I've really tried to jump into the pop genre. And there's a big chorus part where it's you know, crazy big notes. It was different for me, so it was a nice different feel. I feel like my voice leans towards the blues. I could be wrong because a lot of people have told me I should sing country songs. Singing the blues, I really feel it. The blues, it goes into your soul, blues and jazz, I think. A lot of my friends from Frank Sinatra have gone on in music. But I know a lot of people who have gone on to do totally different things. Or one girl I know ended up being a teacher in the same school. She came a dance teacher in the school, and is really, really proud of being there. I've seen people going on to be elementary school teachers, some of them going on to getting married, having babies. And I'm like what is this, it's crazy! (I'm 23). It was a wonderful atmosphere there, a lot of music, drama and art. I would go back ifl could. Just to make it easy again. Getting out of the real life, you know! Ifl could do it over I would. ",

Boles was a bartender for most of his life despite not enjoying the profession, he owned multiple bars in Ridgewood, Woodside, and Manhattan for a period of about 30 years. The interview describes the neighborhood of Woodside and the community of Irish-Americans living together and partaking in social events around the pub. 00:00:24 Christopher begins with describing life growing up on a farm, he born on a farm, and the youngest of 7 sons in Geevagh, Sligo County. Didn�t have electricity until 1956 and grew up without appliances. Had crops and animals on farm, milked cows for the dairy to pay for groceries. 00:02:15 School was �okay�. Two room school taught by women. Learned math. School was a mile and half away from the farm. He started school when he was 6 and stayed until 13. Learned some Gaelic. 00:03:50 Begins to talk about family. Father was from the same area he grew up in. Had one uncle who became an auctioneer in Dublin. 00:05:10 Eileen asks what prompted the move to the US, Christopher responds that it was the way of life. Everyone else was leaving. Left in 1954 to Canada because of a Uranium discovery, and decided it was way too cold to stay in Toronto. Came to North America by boat and train, wasn�t nervous moving over, remembers the train ride in January. Brother was already in NYC. 00:07:38 First impression of NYC: �not good�. Came to NYC in July for a week to visit his brother and it was too loud and too hot - �How could anybody live here� 00:08:16 Work in Toronto; Bus driver and street car driver. Saw no real difference between Canadians and Americans. Christopher said most Canadians were Scotch-Irish and has some prejudices. 00:09:25 Eileen asks how did he end up in New York. His roommates were all moving to America. Mentions the visa applications and the paperwork to live in the United States. Didn�t realize the visa is only good for 6 months and then it expires. Brother opened a bar in Ridgewood and he decided to work for him. 00:11:50 Has experience working in a bar - used to work in one at Belfast. He never liked bartending, enjoyed driving the bus more. Brother knew a man (O�Gare?) from Rockaway and used to work for him on the weekends, and he sold the bar in Ridgewood Christopher�s brother. Lived in the apartment upstairs from the bar. German woman owned the building. 00:13:40 A third brother came over to the America in 1956. Lived in Belfast began to worry about living in Ireland, decided to stay with Christopher, later brought his wife and children over and they never went back. The never planned to stay in America. 00:15:20* Asked what was it liked meeting all different people? Said it was interesting working in the bar. Never liked baseball, would get asked questions about the game. Socialized with other Irish immigrants in Ridgewood. Would go to Gilly Park? on Sunday. Had the odd girlfriend here and there. Would meet new people every day. Also went to the Dance Halls (City Center) on Sunday nights. Would dance Irish Waltzes. Sunday night was bartender night. 00:18:48 Met his wife at his bar in Woodside on 63rd Street. Was a room in the back for dancing with Irish music, Paddy was a fiddle player in his bar, and his wife Betty was a promotor, wanted a crowd to dance. There were a lot of Irish musicians in New York who wanted to meet Paddy, would come from all over the boroughs. His bar was called the Castle Lind and he owned it from 1957 to 1964. 00:22:20 Had an old car. At the gas station in Maspeth and met Jimmy Philbin a former detective and he told Christopher about the bar on sale, and later met another man at the Gaelic Park who was also selling the same bar. It was a dirty and dark place when he came to visit; he bought the place from the old man. Had some savings from Canada, paid half down and pay the rest month. This was called a note. He was still single when he bought the bar. 00:25:30 There were a bunch of Irish girls living in a house near the bar and that is how he met his wife. Move to Woodside on 67th Street after he bought the bar. Rent was 64 dollars a month! Moved to 64 Street after her was married. 00:26:50* The early days in the bar: �The Irish were coming here like flies�. Most of them worked in construction. Some came from England. Would come in and ask for work. Would often network people to work. Didn�t really tell new immigrants what to expect. Bad advice he received was to not to buy a house unless you can do your own repairs. 00:30:05 Had a horse training come in to do some exercises. Would get people asking about work with the horses. 00:31:10 The bar would open at 8am and would close at 4 am. Would meet different people with different temperaments. People changed on the full moon. Kicked a decent amount of people out of his bar. They weren�t dangerous, just �nothing going on upstairs.� 00:32:40 Missed his mother from Ireland, but was happy to be in the US. Took a trip back to Ireland 5 years in and didn�t know what he would do if he stayed. People from Ireland told Christopher that he changed. Two brothers moved to England and two stayed in Ireland. When he was 13 his family left him at a boarding school in Court? so he was used to not seeing his family, �hardened� him. 00:36:20 Gave up the bar at Woodside after he went to 3rd Ave 91st Street in Manhattan and bought a different bar which was close to a brewery for one year. After a year the brewery shut down. Business was not good after that. 00:38:20 Asked about women in bars. Men would bring their wives on Friday night, but that was it in Ridgewood. At Woodside, there were a lot of single girls came into the bar. Married women didn�t come in much. Sometimes it was hard for Christopher�s wife because of the hours he worked. 00:39:50 Owned the bar in Manhattan for 11 years, ended in 1976. The 70�s were bad years but they didn�t bother Christopher. People weren�t as neighborly as people are known. There was some pride in Irish-Catholics when Kennedy was elected president. Was behind the bar of Castle Lind when Kennedy was assassinated. Everyone at the bar mourned him. 00:42:50* The community at Woodside were mostly Irish, German, Italian. Everyone knew everyone at church. People were very proud to be American; there were a lot of veterans in the bar. When asked about his loyalties, played both sides of the fence; kept the Irish tradition with his children, three daughters and a son. Son is a firefighter in Jersey. One daughter in Wyckoff, New Jersey who has two sets of twins. Another daughter is in Rumson, New Jersey, with 3 boys and a girl. Another girl in Jersey is married. Said they didn�t give him any trouble when they were growing up. 00:47:00 Wife is from Donegal in Ireland, she came to American because she had aunts in Philadelphia. Grandchildren know about Ireland but they haven�t visited as much as his son. Christopher has no musical ability, his father played the violin and that side of him is showing in his son. 00:49:00 Asked about being a doorman: Said it was the best job he ever had, better than being a bartender. He could stand and walk around all day and he never got tired. 200 61st Avenue was where he worked. Would have the occasional odd tenant, but everyone was pretty nice. 00:50:20 Christopher doubts grandchildren would understand everything he�s been through to get to America. Worked on �the bog� until he was 16. A lot of people were moving to North Ireland to work so the government required a residence permit to live and work in Belfast. He was declined so he had to go back home to the farm. Said protestant got the good shipbuilding jobs over Catholics. Tried going back to Belfast, decide to not apply for a permit, but he was outed and had to move back after 3 months again. 00:54:30 Coal mine opened up, brother was recruiter to work there. Brother didn�t want this job, Christopher took it instead. Foreman didn�t know who was who, and he got the job. Lasted two months, It was terrible work; the commute was the hardest part to walk up the mountain. He was fired, someone else replaced him and he was only there for a week. 00:57:20 Asked what the worst part about bartending was; he said listening to people�s stories, and people coming in drunk. Money was scarce too, different from today. People would often not pay for drinks. Would ignore the worst customers. Made a lot of good friends during the bartender years. Had some good friends in Astoria, Jackson Heights, friends that worked in the airport, unfortunately a lot of them have passed. 00:59:40 Was in the AOH for a short time. Filburn ran it in Woodside. Wanted a Gaelic football team. Joined the Highbinders (?) Joined the Woodside (??) Chairman of the Dance, promoted the event, would get a crowd to come in, Raised 900 dollars to buy equipment for the football team. The manager wanted to the boss, would often fight with Filburn. Would often moderate the two. Others formed another football team called the Flushing Harps. Because Woodside was off the beaten track, Christopher would advertise often to get more patrons, which means meeting a lot of people. 01:03:00 Asked about what the bar looked like: There were big windows, decorated the tables and chairs. People smoked in bars back then. Christopher stopped smoking 20 years ago. A funny moment: different characters coming in. Never had any interactions with gangsters. A young man got into trouble; a guy almost threw a chair at him, was thrown out and then came back with a shotgun. Christopher locked the door in time. Someone took the keys from him and everyone in the bar ran after him to chase him off. He called the police; the man with the shotgun never came back to the bar. Terrible relationship with the police; would get tickets for little things all the time. Liquor license had to be renewed every year. 1:08:30 Was not sympathetic with any patrons. Belonged to the County Sligo organization, marched in the parade. More active now than when he was younger. Meetings are small; they get letters from people looking for donations. Don�t have a lot of money but try to help out. 1:10:15 Is happy he came to America. The best thing about America is he has always been able to work, never went hungry here, and you have the freedom to be able to do things for yourself. Changes in neighborhood: �nothing I can do about that�. Is happy they are keeping up. Still has neighbors he lived with in Woodside nearby. People are still coming over from Ireland. Was close with some of his neighbors. 01:15:15 Doesn�t remember much Gaelic from his schoolboy days. Used to be good at it. Parents didn�t speak it. 01:17:15 Wanted to travel more. Regrets he didn�t try his luck working for some bigger companies. Maybe try con Edison or telephone companies. Didn�t make much money at the beginning, so that�s why he never tried. 01:19:12 Wishes his children and grandchildren to be educated and to get the best jobs and raise a family. �Keep the party going.� ",

With this economy, this business isn�t going so well, but we�re coping. I�ve lived here 19 years. JB: And I�ve lived here 49 years. JT: I lived for one year in Corona. I didn�t like it because it was very noisy, with a lot of loud music. Here it is a bit more peaceful. Of course there�s still a problem here or there, but we manage. There are people you�d rather not be here. But Astoria is a very good place to live. JB: It�s very expensive. The prices are going up. JT: The good things it has are Astoria Park, the park for dogs, the swimming pool. The schools. The post office, small shops, places for food, everything. JB: All my family is here. JT: My mother, two children, my aunts, three brothers, sisters, nephews�most of them are in Ecuador. My most happy memories? The birth of my children.

The neighborhood is good, the people who live here are good, the problem is when people from outside come through to cause trouble. They call me the grandmother of the neighborhood. JT: We�ve known each other since my 13 year-old son was in pre-kinder.

  "Bridge_AnnThea_timecode.txt": "“There is no question that they are a wild creature. You have to treat them with a certain amount of deference and respect, because they sting. In their mind, I’m the equivalent of a bear—well, I’m a little more gentle than a bear.” Anna Thea Bridge has been interested in bees almost as long as she can remember. But only once beekeeping was legalized in New York City last March, did she install two hives on the roof of her house in Sunnyside Gardens. Beekeeping, Anna says, is so versatile that it is impossible to tire of it. “This month I might be interested in watching them bring pollen back and learning about different kinds of pollen, at another time in hive design and the history of different hives. It keeps your interest potentially for a lifetime,” she says. Currently, Anna enjoys how present and mindful she has to be when working with the bees. She compares beekeeping to meditation and Tai Chi. A litigation attorney, Anna often works long, stressful hours. But on the weekends she puts on her beekeeper’s suit and climbs to the roof, where she moves thoughtfully and slowly to not agitate the bees. She inspects the hives, feeds the bees sugar water and makes sure that the Queen is happy and the hive has enough space. This Memorial Day weekend, Anna added another “super” to one of the hives. The supers look like drawers and contain several frames in which the bees store their honey. When it gets cold, the bees cluster in the hive’s center to keep warm, and some of the supers may have to be removed, because too much space is difficult for the bees to heat. Each of Anna’s hives houses up to 50,000 bees, mostly female workers and male drones, and one queen, the hive’s central character. Affectionately, Anna has named her first two queens Queen Alice and Queen Bernadette, their initials corresponding to the first two letters of the alphabet, presumably the beginning of a tradition. Each hive can produce up to 100 pounds of honey a year. Some of that honey will help to reward Anna’s neighbors. “They were nervous at first that there are going to be bees in their yard all the time. But bees have a three-mile radius,” Anna says. “And they don’t all leave because the queen is inside and they are bonded with her.” In fact, I was surprised how calmly the bees came and went while we were on the roof for Anna’s weekly routine. Sunnyside, with its linden trees, its abundance of flower boxes and its proximity to several cemeteries—bees love the patches of clover that grow there—is the perfect environment for bees. While Anna agrees that bees are wild creatures that have to be treated with deference and respect, she also thinks that their virtue is underestimated. “People don’t really think about pollination but it’s really important,” she says, mentioning the city’s recent push to plant more apple trees in the Big Apple. “If you don’t have any bees you are not going have any apples,” she explains. So if you see a bee in your yard or on the cemetery, be kind to it. Maybe attach a tiny little letter to its pollen sacks, thanking Anna for helping to pollinate Sunnyside’s flowers and fruit trees. In return, you will soon be able to buy “Sunnyside Honey” at the local farmers market. In the podcast Anna talks about the perks of beekeeping and her decision to buy a house in Sunnyside.

  "Brintel_Patricia_timecode.txt": "Patricia Brintel is long-term residents of Jackson Heights and Whitestone.

Religion played a huge role on getting to know her neighbors. She also discussed about her neighbors in her neighborhoods and how the neighborhood has started to change over the years. 00:00:19 Patricia Brintel will start to discuss about Jackson Heights. 00:00:30 Patricia went to the Elmhurst library and she thought that it was nice to come back to her neighborhood. However, the neighborhood changed a lot since she came back and it changed for the worse and the better. 00:01:10 Patricia lived in Broadway, Elmhurst in 1964 when she came there from Haiti.

  "Brock_Carol_timecode.txt": "Carol Lang Brock was born in Corona but spent most of her childhood in Beechhurst. After graduating from Queens College with a degree in home economics, she began a highly successful career in food journalism that included positions with Good Housekeeping magazine, Parents magazine, the New York Daily News and the Queens Times/Ledger. She and her husband eventually bought a home in the Douglas Manor section of Douglaston, where she still resides today. Carol�s memories from her earliest years are filled with references to food and gardening, two important subjects that helped shape her career and influenced her experiences of life in Queens. 00:00:14 Carol was born in Corona in 1923 but moved with her family to Beechhurst when she was 3. Her father was in real estate and built four homes there on former farmland. The homes were Tudors that were designed by an architect who had also designed homes in Forest Hills. 00:02:30 When Carol got married [1944], she and her husband moved to an apartment in Sunnyside. They wanted to live in the Sunnyside Gardens neighborhood but nothing was available; she remembers strolling through the gardens with her young son. During this time she worked for Good Housekeeping magazine. 00:03:36 Beechhurst was still rural when Carol was a child. She remembers a cow grazing near her home and that one of her neighborhood friends had a pony. Her friend�s housekeeper sometimes made her cinnamon toast. This friend�s father was a teacher at Flushing High School, and Carol would trade hunting souvenirs from her own father for marking books that she would use when playing school. 00:05:55 Carol went to P.S. 79 in Whitestone. She won a prize there for baking a daffodil cake, and made her own organdy graduation dress. Her grandmother had been a seamstress, and her mother went to millinery school � she could make copies of the hats she saw in Fifth Avenue store windows. 00:07:30 She later attended Bayside High School and walked about 2 miles to get there. Carol intended to go to Cornell after graduating but wound up enrolling at Queens College because her mother was friends with Judge [Charles] Colden, a founder of the school. It �turned out to be the right decision.� She graduated in three years in September 1944, the same month in which she got married, and started working in November [at Good Housekeeping]. 00:09:07 Carol had thought she�d be a housewife after marrying but her professors, along with her mother and husband, encouraged her to use her education �out in the world.� She had difficulty applying for magazine jobs with no experience, but got an interview with Good Housekeeping. Two of her Queens professors � Margaret Gram and Eula B. Corbin � wrote letters on her behalf, and she got the job of assistant food editor. 00:10:40 Part of her job at Good Housekeeping entailed making lunch every day for the editor, Herbert Mays, and the head of Hearst Corp., Richard E. Berlin, in exchange for their teaching her the magazine business. She had her first published byline about six months after getting the job. 00:11:25 Carol stayed at Good Housekeeping for 23 years and then became food editor of Parents magazine. She continued to make luncheons throughout her years at Good Housekeeping and entertained many distinguished guests, including former President Herbert Hoover, the Duke of Windsor, the president of Mexico and the head of the state of Israel. 00:12:52 When she had been at Good Housekeeping for 10 years, Carol decided to pursue a master�s degree from New York University, which she received in 1963. As an undergrad at Queens, she had also taken three courses at Columbia University � one in magazine writing with [Prof. Ernest] Brennecke, one with food writer Mary Barber, and one in contemporary civilization with a Prof. Clark, which Carol felt helped her write a strong thesis for her program at Queens. For her Home Economics major at Queens, she had to take chemistry and physics classes. One semester, she had a chemistry class at 8 am on Thursdays and often fell asleep in class because Wednesday night was �date night� and she was usually out late bowling. 00:16:15 Carol says she did well in her cooking classes because of her early experiences with her grandmother, who grew vegetables and made cheese from her home in Beechhurst. The family also bought bags of potatoes from Long Island in the fall and stored them in a cold cellar. She remembers one intersession class at Queens when the Home Economics students took over the dining hall and prepared food for the faculty. Carol wanted to create a table setting featuring a live goldfish in a bowl, but chemistry professor [Roland] Whittaker said it would be too distracting for the diners. Her experience serving these meals gave her a respect for restaurant wait staff � it is not an easy job. 00:19:38 For her own lunch at Queens, she most often grabbed a peanut butter sandwich and an apple from the lunchroom on her way to class. The Home Ec department was in a small, two-classroom building near the cafeteria. 00:20:45 As a student, Carol was president of the Home Economics Club. She thinks she was the first alum to join the Alumni Association. Years later, she took a class in belly dancing at Queens and tried tap dancing as well. 00:24:45 Carol�s grandmother had a house in Fresh Meadows, built by her uncle, a civil engineer. She remembers rabbits in the compost piles and especially the presence of a summer kitchen and garden. Later on in Beechhurst, her grandmother had a large garden and still planted corn at the age of 80. Carol�s childhood home was only two blocks from the water; she recalls a friend�s home being demolished when the Cross Island Parkway was built. 00:27:31 Carol�s father was a hunter and fisherman; they had a small boat that they took out in the bay. When Carol was dating her future husband, Emil Brock, he would go eeling with her father in Little Neck Bay. Carol always loved eels and as a child, picked out the �squiggliest� one to be cooked. She and her husband had an outdoor fireplace to smoke eels. Carol vividly remembers getting smoked eel sandwiches from the automat in Amsterdam the first time she and her husband travelled to Europe. 00:30:08 Carol�s father took her to Fort Totten [in Bayside] as a child to watch boxing matches held among the soldiers stationed there. She was an only child. 00:32:06 Carol and her husband looked at a number of neighborhoods in which to buy a home and decided on the Douglas Manor section of Douglaston. It is a landmarked community; the home of [William] Douglas, first winner of the America�s Cup, is there and is now the Douglaston Club. There is great interest in sailing and trees in the community. The Douglas family had trees brought from all over the world by [landscape architect Samuel] Parsons. Near where the Brocks bought their home, there was a 600-year-old white oak as well as a windmill, which was later moved to the Alley Pond Environmental Center. 00:35:15 The Matinecock tribe has history in the area; Carol remembers attending the 100th birthday celebration of Chief Waters shortly after moving to Douglaston. There is currently a proposal to have a commemorative marker for the tribe on the site of his house. There are Matinecock graves in the cemetery at Zion Episcopal Church, which Carol attends. 00:37:09 Carol wrote an article for the Sunday Daily News about Thanksgiving traditions featuring Princess Heatherflower [Chief Waters� daughter], including her recipe for cranberry bread. The Princess also judged the Native American costumes at an annual Boy Scouts� gathering in Douglaston, in which Carol�s sons participated. 00:38:46 Because Douglas Manor is landmarked, no �McMansions� have been built there as in other neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many trees on private property were not protected and have been cut down. All homeowners must belong to the Douglas Manor Association; dues ae $650 per year. There are fewer birds coming in the spring now since so many old trees have been lost. Ethnically, there are more Asian families moving into the community. The Manor has a clean-up day every April, followed by a buffet lunch, among other neighborhood events. Carol feels the newer Asian residents do not participate in these activities and worries about the future of the Manor community. 00:44:19 Carol attended both the 1939 and 1964 World�s Fairs in Flushing Meadows, as well as the International Expo in Montreal in 1967. She thinks the (1964) Fair �brought fine dining to New York City.� Many chefs who came to direct the food operations at the international pavilions stayed in Queens after the event. After leaving the Daily News, Carol worked as a restaurant consultant; one client was a restaurant on Northern Blvd. in Bayside that was run by the man who ran the Spanish dining facility at the Fair; it is still there today (Marbella). 00:48:20 Of all the New York restaurants Carol has visited, her favorite is the Four Seasons � �it is so New York.� She recalls a party given there by Good Housekeeping in honor of its food editor, Dorothy Marsh, who had worked there 50 years. Glass bricks were placed over the pool to create a dance floor, and a Four Seasons employee walked around with a screwdriver to keep the bricks tightly in place. 00:50:06 Carol�s grandmother had an �avant garde� garden � cranberries, herbs such as oregano and bay leaves, etc. As a little girl, Carol would make mud pies there and decorate them with flowers. She recalls gathering flowers that grew in empty lots in Beechhurst to make bouquets on Mother�s Day. Beechhurst is much more built up now but Carol still goes there in the summer for movies and for the Parks Department�s walks to Bayside Marina. 00:53:50 Carol has been very happy living in Queens and loves its ethnic diversity. She enjoys travelling to Manhattan via public transportation and remembers open-ended trains in her youth, as well as the trolleys that ran in Flushing. She reviewed Queens restaurants for the Times/Ledger for 13 years and enjoyed eating �food from all over the world� so close to home. 00:55:55 Years ago, Flushing had open fields and farmhouses. Carol�s uncle used to run his beagles along Little Neck Bay, where the Cross Island Parkway is now. 00:57:55 Carol hopes the history of Queens will be recorded so that its special characteristics can be preserved. While at the Daily News, she wrote often about Douglaston; it has had many interesting residents, including [tennis stars John] McEnroe and Mary Carillo. 01:00:48 Although television has the �glamour� today, magazines had it when Carol started her career, and Good Housekeeping was at the pinnacle. The magazine had its own testing laboratory, test kitchen, beauty clinic, etc., and employed many women with home economics educations, like Carol. She says many men in the advertising department from that time went on to become publishers � it was a very exciting time. Working for the Daily News was also fascinating. 01:04:55 While working for the Times/Ledger, Carol was coordinator of culinary classes for the Great Neck Adult Education program. Until the beginning of this year, she was also special events coordinator for the program. 01:05:54 During her time at the Daily News, Carol founded Les Dames d�Escoffier, a professional organization for accomplished women in the food, wine and hospitality fields, who had previously been excluded from all-male Escoffier groups. It began in 1976 and now has 30 chapters � including one in London � and 2,000 members. A member of this group is president of the Milano 2015 Universal Exposition; another is president of the James Beard Foundation. Les Dames is also very strong in providing mentoring, scholarships and awards to support women in the field. 01:10:50 One of the reasons Carol and her husband settled in Douglaston was its proximity to her mother in Beechhurst. Also, it was important to her as a working mother that her children could easily walk to school and other points of interest. Community clean-up days, yacht races, ecumenical Thanksgiving services � �Douglaston did everything right!� ",

  "Bryant_Linda_timecode.txt": "“When they are feral. They are too used to being outside. They can be very vicious.” Linda Bryant is the president of HYPERLINK \"http://www.lindasferalcatassistance.com/\" Linda’s Feral Cat Assistance, an organization that traps and neuters stray cats in Queens and then returns them to their colonies in the wild. Linda, who is originally from England, founded her group ten years ago when she noticed that feral cat colonies were a significant problem in Sunnyside and Woodside. She was instrumental in establishing and spreading the word about TNR—short for Trap, Neuter and Return—in the New York area. TNR helps to control the feral cat population and has drastically reduced the euthanasia rates of city shelters. Linda’s group traps between 300 and 500 feral cats in Queens a year. The ASPCA’s mobile clinic neuters and vaccinates the cats, and Linda’s Feral Cat Assistance holds them for a couple of days to recover from surgery. Volunteers then put them back out into the wild, providing food and shelter in a designated area. Only few of the cats are tame enough to be adopted. Most feral cats are too wild to live among humans, and TNR is the only alternative to euthanasia.“When they are feral,” Linda says, “they are too used to being outside. They can be very vicious. They are completely reverted back to their natural stage.” Linda’s Feral Cat Assistance has several volunteers in Queens who help trap and take care of the cats after surgery. But Linda explains there are several ways of contributing to the effort. “We can always use cat food and gas money,” she says. Those who would like to get more involved can take a class to become TNR certified. She says the group’s biggest problem is finding garages and basements to hold the cats in the winter while they are recovering from surgery. In the podcast Linda talks about the TNR process, feral cat colonies in Sunnyside and the various ways of getting involved in the effort. ",

Recently had a family reunion, when his mother turned 100, and members of the family (his mother�s side) came from other parts of the country. 00:06:26* Life in Astoria: Mother spoke of how there was �a lot of farmland sold in Queens.� She married fairly late, had Don at age 33. 00:07:05 Once, his mother explained how his father was divorced when she met him. 00:07:26 Capalbi visited the graves of his father and his mother�s mother (died in her early fifties): father died of occupational illness/cancer. 00:07:55* First time Don got married at age 20, but divorced at 23; he believed there was more of a �stigma� to being divorced at that time. 00:08:24 Italian community in Astoria: Astoria was comprised of people of Italian and Irish descent, with a synagogue across the street not far from where he lived. 00:08:43 As he was growing up (prepubescent and into puberty), he did not know any kids who were neither Irish or Italian, except for a Polish kid moving into the neighborhood. The Irish were the dominant group since they arrived earlier. 00:09:30* Inclination to not being prejudiced to Asians in Flushing is due to his recollection of what it was like being called a �guinea� as a kid. 00:10:06 Didn�t care about race differences between peoples or different races of people. 00:10:18* Transferred from Manhattan College to a number of Catholic schools, then to Long Island University (Brooklyn), which was predominantly Jewish. 00:10:35 Met a fellow who was a black sophomore: they shared many conversations regarding being African-American. Capalbi had been unaware of racial inequalities until then. 00:11:28* Capalbi was born in 1945: was in college when Kennedy was killed. Remembers he was having lunch across the street from campus when he heard about JFK�s assassination. 00:12:08 Grew up in 50s/60s, and was friends with those of Irish and Italian descent. The Catholic church/parish was fairly important then, maybe less important to the Italians than to the Irish. Church in New York was the church of the Irish � style of religion, cathedral named for Irish saint (St. Patrick). 00:12:59* In Italy, the priest did not tell you to read the Bible or encourage it, but to let them teach you �their version of the Bible.� 00:13:25 Went to public school for four years and then local parish built a new, large building which was added to their existing elementary school and afforded his mother an opportunity to send Don to Catholic school. 00:13:47 He switched to Catholic school in 5th grade and graduated 8th grade; students were encouraged to go to Catholic high school. 00:14:20 His family was unsophisticated. Women weren�t as upfront in �knowing things� � mother had only 4th grade education. Don accepted into many schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2 00:14:57 Boys were encouraged in high school to become priests or brothers. 00:15:16 Christian Brothers taught at LaSalle, and also ran Manhattan College in the Bronx. 00:15:36* Capalbi took religion very seriously at first and felt that if what he was taught about God and the church was true, that the right vocation would be the priesthood/brotherhood. 00:16:21 Took Mandatory Theology 1 & 2 in first year of college, which taught how reasonable it is that there is a God based on reason without teaching. The more he looked at it, the less sense it made to him. 00:17:55 He believes now in a brother/sisterhood of humanity: �We�re all clones except for our genes and our personal experiences.� But if you take out the variability of our genealogy and personal experiences, we become a part of each other, we share the same soul. 00:19:18 Recent experiences reminded him of 1960s hippie culture: Currently �a plague of hipness� in Williamsburg, like a religion. Also, outside a bar on Lower East Side, he saw three youngsters (in their 20s) sitting on a sidewalk panhandling. In the 60s, mostly affluent youth were in hippie movement, �taking a few years out of their life to see what it was like to be poor.� 00:21:20 Regrets that he was na�ve towards and not involved in Civil Rights Movement. He heard Martin Luther King on TV/radio and believed that style of Black oratory was just entertainment. 00:22:43 How Black churches look upon life and death is more real than celebrating death: he admires their attitude. 00:23:26 Don�s childhood address in Astoria was 26-49 30th Street, a very �non-descript working class block with an amalgam of architecture,� between Astoria Blvd. and Newtown Ave., near 30th Ave. (which used to be called Grand Ave.). A lot of youth move into this area now. 00:24:08 Lived in a six-family apartment house, two apartments on each floor. One Irish family lived across the hall from the Capalbi's; generous people who helped Don when his father died. 00:24:36 This family had a summer house in Mastic, Long Island: they would go on weekends in the spring, summer and fall, taking Don and his mother with them. Family patriarch extended the house and took Don with him to help on project. 00:25:22 Local Democratic Club would send kids to Yankee Stadium in summer � pre-renovated stadium. Don has recollections of his father: walking down the street with him, holding hands and listening to Yankee games on a transistor radio. Current Citi Field (Mets� stadium) reminiscent of Brooklyn Dodgers� Ebbets Field. 00:27:18 Democratic Party: �I have always been interested in policy.� As a kid, interested in the Adlai Stevenson campaign. Mother was �a product of the Depression. And people who lived in the Depression stayed people of the Depression.� Even though the Depression ended, the people didn�t change and did without. His mother was an �FDR Democrat.� 00:28:05 Stevenson�s first run for president occurred when Don was a child. Don volunteered and helped Stevenson as much as he could as a teenager. 00:28:39 Democratic Club dominated the political landscape of the community; local club important. He was too young to join party or participate in committees. 00:29:58 Capalbi�s civic engagement came largely due to his philosophical beliefs. He has a very deep philosophy of the meaning of life: �I believe the difficulty in finding the answer to what is the meaning of life is because of the fact that life has no meaning. There is no meaning to life. We live like the ants live. There is no meaning unless we put meaning into our lives.� 00:30:36 Capalbi has no kids and is married to his second wife. Searches the solar system for any meaning to his life. Tries to create meaning by doing good. 00:31:52 Involved in many volunteer groups, and his travel agency focuses on people with disabilities. Started to focus locally: got involved with neighbor who was running for State Assembly. 00:32:20 To Capalbi, television is like a babysitter for adults of our culture. He prefers reading about and participating in real-life drama of politics. 00:34:01 Listens to news radio � refers to particular commentator�s style, which is awkward and used to gain attention. Feels most news is presented as �infotainment.� Prefers Al Jazeera and BBC; Russian news and Chinese news to hear �other side� of the story. 00:35:39 Radio commentator stated we are living in an oligarchy, not a democracy, because who runs for office is largely determined by a small group. Very difficult for independents to win � Capalbi feels this is true at all levels. 00:37:28* He remains involved with politics. Everything, not just politics, is corrupt � educational system, Wall Street, etc. � because humanity is corrupt. You must deal with and work within the rules. 00:37:57* Works for an Assemblywoman named Grace Meng because she is the best and he receives satisfaction from her, although the pay is low. He believes she is what the country needs. 00:39:35* Acquired his job from neighbor who ran for Assembly and asked Don if he wanted to run for District Leader. District Leader is lowest level of elected office and a non-paying job. 00:40:43 Capalbi became member of one of the Democratic Clubs in Flushing and became vice president of that club. When incumbent assemblywoman ran for re-election, he felt he could not support her for re-election compared to Meng. 00:41:32 Resigned from the Democratic Club under the belief that it wasn�t proper to remain in the club and not support their candidate. He describes the intrigue involved in running for office, even at the local level. 00:44:27 When Meng was elected, she asked Capalbi to be her Community Liaison. Job included attending events where either Grace couldn�t make it or felt not important enough for her to go; she sent Capalbi instead. 00:44:50 Most politicians have Community Liaisons under different titles/names; usually a 22-23 yr. old who just sits and takes notes. He tried to do more with it; met many people. 00:45:55 Capalbi questioned why his local civic association seemed to be dormant. He ended up taking on leadership role of group (Queensboro Hill Civic Association). 00:46:57 Although considered a great honor, job was unpaid. Began to run the civic as he saw fit. Gathered political and elected officials as guest speakers, held candidates� forums. 00:48:15 Believes that a good civic runs with good community participation, in theory. Has found it difficult to get the degree of participation he would like. But, he finds that a group is influential if it appears to be � perception is a big part of reality. 00:50:15 Different groups discuss a multitude of issues such as zoning, congestion, transportation, parks, relations to other institutions, and more. 00:51:09* In his civic group, there is no single pressing issue right now. One concern is New York Hospital Queens, which is a world-class hospital in community. There are concerns with congestion, parking, littering, etc. The hospital wants part of Kissena Corridor Park (next door) for parking, as it plans on adding a new cancer treatment center. 00:53:21 As part of conservancy for the park, Capalbi and his group want a meditation garden across the street from park. 00:54:19 He suggested to hospital that they make an offer to take this park for parking and provide other parkland elsewhere in Flushing. As leader of local community, Capalbi stated he would support this concept. Would be a win-win situation. 00:55:18 Other local issues include stores with no signs in English. 00:56:22 Capalbi didn�t move from Astoria to Flushing. He was living on Upper West Side of Manhattan at the time. He closed down a business and moved back to Queens. But he has owned his house in Flushing for about 35 years, with his mother living there; he lived there off and on over the years. When he married a second time, they lived in several areas of the West Side. 00:57:57 Was inspired to buy in Flushing for his mother: he wanted a location conveniently close to transportation and shops. 00:58:42 Intersection Don lives by is close to the Long Island Expressway and Main Street, a few blocks from New York Hospital Queens. 00:59:28 Asian influx was unexpected, but he feels it saved Flushing. 01:02:03* Capalbi has worked in many different businesses. As a young man, he worked at the (1964) World�s Fair while going to Manhattan College. Outside the placement office, there was a list on a bulletin board with 10 companies that were to be at the World�s Fair. He wanted a summer job. 01:02:42* Used his typewriter to compose a letter and sent a copy to each of those companies, one of which was Post Houses Inc. That was the only response he received. 01:03:13 This company was going to run the Rheingold Exhibit and the Greyhound Pavilion at the World�s Fair. Capalbi corresponded with the personnel director at the company. He was offered a job as assistant manager at the Rheingold Pavilion, which was a food services operation. 01:03:58* The Greyhound Bus Company conglomerate had a food service division with three food service companies: one was Post Houses, which took its name from the rest areas that stage coaches would stop at. 01:04:36 The operation became a huge success. Capalbi ended up supervising 165 employees at age 19. Job started in April and ended in November, as that was when the Fair ran. Was also going to school full-time and struggled to keep up with classes. 01:05:21 Managed to obtain good grades, was 200th of a point below cum laude. 01:06:30 His job at the World�s Fair was not a prestigious job, but it was fun, lots of young people working there. Half the employees were female, one of whom he married. 01:07:10* After graduating college, Capalbi started working for Metropolitan Life. They offered 10 jobs for college graduates for fast-tracking in the company: worked in the accounting department, but it wasn�t for him. 01:07:41* Rheingold Pavilion was a street in turn-of-the-century New York City. Featured an outdoor park with two bandstands from which food was served. There was also a street that ran through the pavilion with food carts. 01:08:13 There was a strip of buildings in turn-of-the-century style, which ran food services operations via a tavern at one end and a sit-down restaurant at the other. 01:08:40 Capalbi ran the outside operation. It was a turn-of-the-century New York theme park, no rides. Attractions included old-fashioned car for photographs. There was also a bandstand and a couple of kiosks for food. 01:09:40 The atmosphere was fun for everyone. It was especially fun for him to work there with other young people. His favorite pavilions were Schaefer, Ford, GM, and AT&T. 01:11:52 Capalbi took his next job, after Metropolitan Life, at Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J., but decided instead to work as an assistant manager in a pancake house on Long Island. 01:13:00 He did not want to give up his life for a career. Would like to live more comfortably, but feels it�s better to have less money and enjoy your life. 01:13:38 Capalbi believes there is a satisfaction to the immediate results, immediate ramifications of what you are doing, in food service. It�s a gut-level job, dealing with people instead of paper. 01:15:40 Even supervising groups of restaurants still has that contact to people. 01:16:00 Capalbi wanted something else to do. He enjoyed travel and wanted to work for a travel agency. 01:16:13 Found it is a terrible industry to work in unless you have a niche or a relationship with a conglomerate. Commissions very low. 01:16:40 He had an Internet client and walked him through lots of information, but the client ended up booking elsewhere for $13 less. 01:17:37 He assists a British couple, both of whom are blind, with their travel arrangements. He was a member of SATH (Society for Accessible Travel and Hospitality), from which he got this referral. 01:18:34* Capalbi had become a volunteer at Mayor�s Office for People with Disabilities. Was a member of the Queens and Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce as a travel agent. Once or twice a year, the five borough chambers come together: he attended one meeting in Staten Island at the Yankees ballpark. 01:19:02 The president of the Brooklyn chamber spoke and introduced Matt Sapolin, who was the commissioner at the Mayor�s Office for People with Disabilities. 01:19:25 When no one was around, Capalbi went up to speak with Sapolin, and eventually Sapolin put Capalbi on a volunteer committee at the office; he served on that committee for 8 years. 01:19:47 Matt was blind from childhood cancer and died a year before this interview. Cancer resurfaced at the age of 41 and he passed away after about three years. 01:20:36* Because he became associated with people with disabilities, Capalbi became a member of SATH, and then he worked with the woman who runs the New York Office for SATH. 01:22:00 If he could have afforded to live on Park Avenue in Manhattan, he would have. 01:22:22 Looked at other communities where he would prefer to live: found Flushing to be dynamic, with good access to the city and Long Island. 01:23:32 Character of Queens: Likes the diversity of Queens and the city in general. 01:24:12 Enjoys multicultural performances, especially by high schools such as Townsend, with kids from different cultures. 01:24:25 At East-West School, Chinese students will perform an act in the African-American style, African-American students perform something Korean, etc. At Lunar New Year Parade at Town Hall, people danced to Columbian music. 01:25:07 He went out with a Costa Rican girl, Egyptian girl, African-American girl, and a Filipino. 01:25:30 Capalbi feels that people who live in New York may better understand the joy of mixing with people from different cultural backgrounds. 01:26:28 To Capalbi, the development of Willets Point on both sides of Citi Field is the best thing to develop and change in Queens in years. Development of public spaces and parks there, will take a number of years to mature. 01:27:00 There is a plan for retail development where the parking lot of Citi Field is. The mayor has selected the same developer he always selects to develop that. There has already been improvement in clean-up of creek. 01:28:40 Retail development will be the first focus; ground may turn out to be too contaminated for housing. 01:29:53 Feels that living in Queens is great. Who knows how large population really is, if all undocumented residents were counted? 01:29:59 Mother still considers herself an immigrant. ",

  "Cavallo_Dorothy_timecode.txt": "“The newer children who are coming here unfortunately do not have this available to them, and their parents don’t know all the history.” Forty years ago, when her little son ran through one of the hedges of the Phipps Garden Apartments, Dorothy Cavallo immediately received a phone call from the management office reprimanding her. Phipps’s on-site nursery school and playground offered sand boxes, slides, swings and a swimming pool to romp around in, but the Gardens were just to be seen. “Our site here has diminished somewhat in its outside appeal,” Dorothy laments in her Phipps Garden apartment of 46 years. “It’s sad to see and sad to say.” An anniversary brochure from 1980 likened Phipps Garden to the great Botanical Gardens in the Bronx and in Brooklyn. “To step into the gardens through the archway,” it reads, “is to move into a world whose existence in the midst of New York City is as astonishing as the land into which Lewis Carrol’s Alice tumbled.” Today the Phipps Garden management frequently receives complaints: Children run across the grass and ride their bikes on the pathways, colliding with pedestrians and strollers, and teenagers skateboard down the old steps. Adults feed the Garden’s colony of stray cats, scattering Styrofoam plates on the lawn, and dog walkers fail to clean up after their dogs. Built in the 1930s by philanthropist Henry Phipps and urban renewal architect Clarence Stein, the Phipps Garden Apartments followed the ideals of the turn-of-the-century English Garden City movement. In high contrast to the dark, dingy and crowded tenement buildings still common in New York at the time, Phipps Garden offered 472 clean, bright and safe apartments to working class families. It even allowed cats and dogs. A private well was dug to water the flora, and old female guards were employed to sit on the courtyard benches and make sure no children tramped through bushes and across lawns. Landscaped courtyards still take up 57 percent of the development, but the guards have long vanished and the nursery has shut down. The playground was sold to a private developer in 2007. Phipps and Stein’s social vision was to encourage tenants to actively participate in the communal living environment, and Dorothy, who was raised in Astoria and moved to Sunnyside as “a brand new bride” in 1958, was quick to implement their ideals. In the winter she led children through the Gardens singing Christmas carols and in the summer she was part of the “carriage-stroller-brigade,” blocking rush hour traffic to lead the little ones safely across 39th Avenue. (“You were risking your life out there!” the 71-year-old laughs.) As a substitute teacher at the nursery school, she even jumped into the playground pool. “I was the bathing beauty,” she giggles, adding that she was the only teacher willing to show herself in a bathing suit at the populated corner of 39th Avenue and 50th Street. (In the podcast she tells us more about her experiences at the Phipps Garden playground and nursery.) Whenever Dorothy now passes the closed-off, derelict playground with its deteriorated aluminum shed and its rusting swings, Dorothy hears the children’s laughter. “The newer children who are coming here unfortunately do not have this available to them,” she says, “and their parents don’t know all the history.” ",

  "Chang_Dong_timecode.txt": "“The real treatment begins from the moment the patient walks into the clinic.” Dong Soo Chang, a former accountant who lives in Maspeth, had a very pragmatic reason for opening up his acupuncture and herbology practice on 43rd Avenue and 46th Street. The close proximity to the 7 line and to the city would allow people easy access to his services at rates far lower than those of his colleagues in Manhattan. After working with and learning from his father-in-law for several years, he and his wife opened up their Sunnyside clinic four years ago. It has since attracted clients not only from New York City, but also from Boston and Long Island, and even as far as California. “The real treatment begins from the moment the patient walks into the clinic,” Chang quotes one of his old professors to explain the holistic approach. This, together with his knowledge and technique, is responsible for his success. (With 35 percent of his patients being Hispanic, it also helps that Chang, who used to live in Buenos Aires, is fluent in Spanish.) Having studied in both the U.S. and Korea, Chang takes advantage of the benefits of both cultures. In his home country acupuncture and herbology stem back thousands of years and are considered the primary medical treatment options. Chang explains that while Korean acupuncturists know more techniques, the U.S. leads in terms of double-blind studies, proving and disproving alternative healing methods and showing the chemical process initiated by such things as herbs, minerals, roots, leaves and seeds. American scientists have also conducted magnetic resonance imaging during treatment to show the effect acupuncture has on a patient’s brain. While the 80 percent of his patients who have been referred to him by relatives and friends are generally trusting, walk-ins often express doubt. “Does acupuncture really work?” some ask. Chang always takes the time to explain the benefits to them, most notably that acupuncture is natural and strengthens the immune system so the body can pick up from there and heal itself. “If I explain these positive aspects to them, they become hopeful,” he says, “and try acupuncture.” ",
  "Chavez_Greg_timecode.txt": "“You are the boy that danced with me in Astoria.” “I was educated in a different way,” says Greg Chavez, who was born and raised in Astoria. He dropped out of high school to travel around the world with The Shirelles, the first major American girl band, which landed their biggest hit, “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” in the early sixties. After a rapturous life in show biz, Greg returned to Sunnyside three years ago to care for his 86-year-old father. At a concert in Astoria in the early seventies, Greg, then 16, sprang into action when Addie “Micki” Harris asked if anyone in the audience could dance “The Bump.” Greg’s bump made such an impression on Micki that she recognized him a few months later at a concert in Florida. “You are the boy who danced with me in Astoria,” Micki said, according to Greg. From then on the two were inseparable. For a decade, Greg worked as a road manager for The Shirelles, carrying their luggage, making sure no one entered the dressing room and buying pantyhose and super glue when the need arose. In return he was slipped $50 bills in his pocket during their many flights. “I was a gopher,” he says laughing, as we recently sat talking at “The Haab” on 48th Avenue. “You know, not the animal, but ‘go-for-this’, ‘go-for-that’.” Eventually Greg was promoted from “gopher” to “manager,” booking shows for the band, but his new position didn’t last too long. In 1982 the band broke up after Micki died of a heart attack on stage in Atlanta. Greg says he was treated “very bad” after that. He followed Shirley, who had begun a solo career in the mid-seventies, and later worked as a freelance booking agent for South Florida clubs and for individual artists, among them Mary Wilson of The Supremes, Bonnie Pointer from the Pointer Sisters and Grace Jones. As the music scene changed and as he felt the tug of family, Greg decided to return to the apartment in Sunnyside he had bought 30 years ago, where he now lives with his brother and father. Until recently he worked as a barkeeper at Daizies Restaurant, but the job didn’t allow him enough flexibility to continue his career in the music business. “I had the time of my life,” Greg says about his previous career, “but I could have done a little bit more of mine. I always put myself out for somebody else.” Currently Greg works with the 10-year-old granddaughter of Mary Davis, who once toured with The Shirelles and with whom Greg has stayed very close over the years. “As a tribute to the girls” he shows the child old video footage and teaches her the songs and moves of Billy Holiday and Dinah Washington. His dream is to get a young R&B group together and act as their manager. “What they call R&B today is not R&B,” Greg says. “I don’t want to see a girl grabbing her crotch on stage. It’s not classy, it’s trashy. I call it bootie-shake music. I want to bring the respect back to girls.” ",

As a child, she remembers neighbors renting out rooms in their mansions for extra income during the Great Depression. McQuilling married her neighbor, Wayne Christensen whose family settled into the neighborhood in 1936 when both he and Annalou were freshmen on different campuses of St. John�s College.

  "Chu_Aili_timecode.txt": "Aili Chu is an immigrant from Taiwan to the United States in 1960s. She became a long time resident of Flushing, Queens after she received her visa to America through his husband working relation. In this interview, Aili discussed about her personal life, family members, and the support system of the United States government. Holidays, races, and language were all important components involved in development of Flushing. Aili also discussed how Flushing has become a center for the immigrant community, primarily consisting of Asians. 00:01:09 Aili Chu was born in 1942, Taiwan. 00:01:49 Aili came to United States when she was 20 years old. 00:02:17 Aili never worked in the US after she came to America; she was supported by her husband who worked for the Taiwanese government. She came to the US because of her husband worked here. 00:03:31 Aili talks about why she thinks the US is a great country. She was born in China, but her family immigrated to Taiwan with her shortly after her birth during the conflicts between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Nationalist Party (also known as the Kuomintang). 00:05:05* Flushing is the first choice of settlement for many Chinese immigrants because transportation is convenient and easy to communicate using Chinese Mandarin. There were not many people living in Flushing when she first migrated to Flushing, especially not as many Chinese immigrants as today. 00:06:40 Aili�s son is currently living in Iowa. There are only a few Chinese American residents in Iowa, and it is not as overpopulated as New York. 00:07:22 When asked about the reasons why she came to United States, Aili said she came because she had an opportunity to come to the US. 00:07:31 Marriage between Aili and her husband was arranged by their family. 00:08:00 Aili�s husband was working for the Taiwanese government, so he didn�t live in United States with Aili, but he would sometimes come to New York to visit her. 00:09:00 Aili spoke about her religious perspective. She also mentioned that she relied on her parents when she was a child, relied on his husband when she grew up, and now relying on the government. 00:10:39 Aili�s son was born in Taiwan and he came to US after Aili. He later moved to Iowa. 00:12:20 Aili became a Christian in Taiwan since she was a child because there were many western Christians and churches in Taiwan at that time. The churches would send cards and give candies to children. People became more familiarized with Christianity. After she came to the US, she became a member of the Faith Bible Association located at 133-25 37th Avenue, Flushing, NY 11354. 00:14:12 Aili explains why she doesn�t think she�s a good mother. She doesn�t know how to cook and eat out often. Her personal home health aide currently cooks for her. 00:16:40 Aili talks about how she never really had any challenges or difficulties in life. She�s still renting an apartment room for $650 a month. 00:19:26 Aili mentions that his son has a good job in Iowa, she has two grandsons that are in college right now. She is not worried about her family. 00:19:52 Aili went back to Taiwan a few times after she first came to America, but she does not want to go back anymore due to its weather condition. 00:21:39 Aili likes to go shopping in the Flushing area. She also watches Chinese TV and read Chinese newspapers. 00:24:59 Aili goes to the Chinese Christian Herald Crusades� (CCHC) senior day care center located at 156-03 Horace Harding Expressway, Flushing, NY 11367 from Monday to Friday, and church on Sunday.

She also criticized the other seniors at senior center who pack excess food to take home. 00:42:30 Aili likes to be straightforward. 00:42:50 The streets in Flushing are much better now than before, because there are less homeless people or beggars on the streets, most of them are Caucasian. 00:43:15 Aili likes to visit lively place, but not too crowded. 00:43:34 Sanitation problem in Flushing, such as people smoking on the street, littering and that they like to gather in a crowd, but nonetheless Flushing is very convenient. 00:44:27 Aili will sometimes purchase bread for the homeless. 00:45:34 Aili is very confident about her health. 00:46:30 Aili believes the purpose of every religion is to do good things for people. 00:48:30 Aili often go to the CCHC to listen to gospel and to join their gathering. 00:49:28 Aili came to America after she finished high school in Taiwan. 00:50:10 How Aili raised her son and wanted him to be independent 00:51:10 Her daughter-in-law is Taiwanese, but her daughter-in-law thinks Aili�s personality is serious. 00:51:35 Aili�s son and his wife was married in Taiwan. 00:52:15 Aili�s husband was a guard for the Taiwanese president Chiang Kai-shek. 00:58:00 Aili has one sister who�s currently living in Taiwan. 01:00:10 Aili prefers not to buy house but rent instead, because rent allows mobility when she wants to move. She lives in a 3 family condo apartment; she does not care about the renting price and other living expenses. 01:05:23 Aili warns about the danger of taking too much medicine because it will harm one�s liver. 01:09:50 Aili would sometimes go shopping for food with her home attendant nurse.

  "Cimkentli_Levent_timecode.txt": "Levent Cimkentli describes his family�s strong connections to the World�s Fair.

  "Clayton_Ian_timecode.txt": "Dan: What is your earliest… Banks: Earliest memory of queens is when I went home with a girl who turned out to be my girlfriend she lived in queens. I was living in Brooklyn south prospect park and this is about 1987 and I giver her a ride home she lived in Steinway street in Astoria and um lets see we were an item for about 3 years but my first impression of queens was coming to Astoria I had just moved into New York City and all of it was new, uh living in uh Brooklyn with a man who was a friend of a friend who happened to have a room and I um it was sort of tough quarters there, let me try to speed through this but this building in Brooklyn happened to be filled with people from Tibet. It wasn’t a Tibet neighborhood it was just this building and it started with one guy from Tibet cause we can cause he brought more and he filled up this whole building with Tibet. That was on quartile road and um lived there for about a year uhh and then um girlfriend… she was a topless dancer… Halloween she was leaning against a parking meter on ST. marts place avenue A wearing just a little velvet dress and had no costume except the blood on the side of her mouth and big vampire teeth oh yeah she was drinking wild turkey straight outta the bottle like this lively lass and then uh I just walked up to the parking meter and put a quarter in and said “ I got you for 15 minutes” and anyway we went to her place she was a seasoned new Yorker from long island and all that. I’m this goofy hick from Tennessee and uh she just thought it was a one night stand ya know and then head back the next day and it blew her mind. It was great man we had a good thing uhhh lets see that was Astoria, Astoria I loved in that time in the 80s uh Astoria was uh still a safe neighborhood it was being patrolled by guys named Nick, Big Mike, Guy and tony driving around in Trans-Ams with baseball bats uh cause they were keeping the Puerto Ricans out it was a very safe neighborhood Dan: not official law enforcement Banks: oh no no no it was the Greek boys you know uh yeah sure and uh the other impression I had about uh Astoria was uh is um the Greek orthodox churches ya know, churches are a friendly place but and one time people were coming out of the Greek orthodox church the women who were very traditional and all that I’m this hick from Tennessee and I’m like “excuse me ma’am can you tell me what time it is” HISSSSSSSSSSS and I’m like wow jeez she just like hissed at me. Coming out of church and hissing at me I was confused I get it now, okay well that was my first impression of queens but we lived next to this bocce ball court it was on Steinway and 5th mars Steinway, lets see around there there was this huge bocce court and ahhh man I definitely got the full flavor of uh the queens and Astoria and Greek and Italian men and uh I always loved New York City and I arrived up here and yes New York City has been uh great to me I’m here because of the variety of people the smorgese board New York City and queens but you have people from all over the world you know growing up in America growing up in Tennessee its you know you have black people and white people and you know they shop at kmart watch the news and its so so harmonized and uh come up here and its every block is a different country Dan: Did you always see yourself moving to a bigger city I know… from Tennessee to New York that seems like such a huge Banks: I had a great love for New York and uh a it seemed like my mother was involved in theater my uh older sister uh we always appreciated like broadways and musicals and stuff and I grew up uh you know listening to great musicals things like guys and dolls are you familiar with that? Dan: yeah living with the parents you kind of pick up on those things Banks: Sure and all the great old movies uh and um yeah I was at an early age by uh the uh this spirit of um the industrial revolution but the after world war 2 the big industrial boom and the great America all sort of philosophy that America was the greatest and um art deco architecture as a little kid iw as fascinated by uh new york city and by uh art deco architecture and um when I went to elementary school in Tennessee at the time was not uh the greatest public school system in the country and so the books that I learned to read on were like books form the 50s and stuff and it was all films that were you know sort of back dated so I got sort of a full measure of that sort of propaganda like you know we are an industrialized sort of nation Dan: it was probably even more extreme down in Tennessee Banks: Sure, uh yeah I didn’t always, it was sort of the formative years I went to a private school for a while so I got a fine education but I do remember my early textbooks and early films fascinated me as this great America thing and then as a lad, the sort of disillusion that Vietnam it was sort of like the war that we didn’t win, we won everything, and then uh seeing the cars go mammoth to like getting smaller, the 70s was even kind of the bubble bursting on the great America thing uhhh but what brought me to New york was this fascination with uh um sort of art deco and architecture and you know the spirit of New York in its um old movies and stuff. But I wasn’t essentially planning on moving here lets see uh I visited here in uh 1974 we passed through I saw it and came back in 1976 I uh neighbor and his best friend and his mother they stayed 2 days in downtown loved it, came back in 78 my cousin was a hostess at the lone star café a famous venue in um west village history Lone star roadhouse , uh that was 1978 anyway I wasn’t planning on moving here I did my plot and went to art school in 1980 and uh anyway fast forward the tape im back in Columbus Ohio in 1986 and a girlfriend of mine there, just a friend, can you give me a ride to new york city, I asked 5 people so far in the 11th hour and they backed out I’ve got a place lined up I have a job lined out I just need a ride and you got a good car. And I got this chill, I’m like yeahhhhh sure ill give you a ride to New york yeah and im getting chills now just thinking about it. So I’m kind of spooky im like yeah sure well she says you can stay for a week ya know fine. Well this was in uh Brooklyn and prospect park it was this beautiful uh I go straight to Washington square park and um and fall in with these street musicians who take me to an improve standup theatre thing and I’m just absolutely fell in live you know im like this is it I go back to Columbus Ohio where I was living just gave everything away, I had a Volkswagen in my garage, I took the plates off of it I had my Toyota as a second car, gave away everything except my clothes and a guitar and came up here the car got towed the night before I was leaving and that sort of took all of my money to get it back and I was like god I might not have enough money uh am I going to be crawling back home with my hat in my hand and I had this epiphany like no, don’t even let your fears and doubts have a chance to form an image, think about your dream and don’t ask how this is when I was 25 and yeah had that thought and uh ya know I’m doing the calculations I had just enough gas money to get up there with $20 leftover. And then like I go for it and then I’m going to get my car um and then I look down on the ground and there’s a $10 bill and no body is around and I say you know what that’s just my luck, ever since then, I’m like you know what just my luck. And then I call my operation JML industries, and then it stuck Dan: Just my luck industries Banks: but uh yeah and I did wind up getting to town with $20 in my pocket and a place to stay for a week with the girl I’ve given a ride. And uh I immediately went down to 9th avenue and got a job at a car wash washing cars and detailing cars uhhh I did that for about a month until um I had experience with exotic cars kind of being a stable boy not at a ranch but taking care of exotic cars at a place called exotic car emporium hired me as a foreman of a detail shop so all of a sudden I had a good job and um boom so oh and part of this job was delivering Porsche 911s to Yonkers and back so uh I get here with $20 bucks and like about 6 weeks later I’m driving porches down the road just my luck. So you know what I am rambling there but that’s my first impression of queens and uh just uh coming to this town and uh you know its funny I still have the same love for new york city same excitement I uh don’t know how it is I dig it all of my hippy and artist friends have so many different temps of art I’ve heard of so long “oh its not what it used to be the scene used to by better” Dan: what’s your opinion on that? Banks: this is a great scene now it keeps changing its just human nature, just nostalgia Dan: better than what it used to be or do you think its.. Banks: in a lot of ways its not as much of a spirit not as much as an art scene necessarily its not as unified or cohesive we didn’t have the common I mean uh I guess it was this common enemy of like it was sort of a hippie thing and you could still be rebellious Dan: So you think it was kind of more underground? Banks: uh yeah because you could still shock Dan: oh okay Banks: and now yeah so maybe that’s why people say there’s not as much a scene meyabe because uh well it’s pretty hard to shop Dan: Especially with the Internet Banks: Sure Dan: everything is just information overload Banks: Sure but the town is very livable now law and order the infrastructure ive lived here through the 80s and 90s when there was the crack epidemic and it really was a dangerous place Dan: do you want to talk about that a little? Banks: on that uh lets see, we can go off on that lets try to get to the big scope where else are you trying to go is there an end Dan: um there’s no end point honestly its just really an hour um I kind of just want to pick as much as I can with your experiences with your experiences in New York City and then Banks: Sure Dan: kind of form that and see where you were and kind of are now and just kind of ride that ride I guess you could say through your experiences Banks: um ill defiantly do that, 86 and 87 I was with uh Cornelia the dancer but she the girl had no faith she thought that we die it was just gray and anyway this is kind of an incompatibility I had been, I got a job Dan: Didn’t realize that went off im pretty sure it still records though, were good Banks: okay Dan: yeah keep going Banks: I uh lets ee im not sure why I stopped with the auto detailing job at exotic car emporium on the west side highway I uh but I got a job delivering flowers for Charles Floral in Astoria. Charles Floral a guy Filipo, he had inherited the business from his father. Who had established this floral company on Broadway in Astoria probably in the 50s or something his son had it. Well, they had it was a very reputable florist and Filipo was just absolutely the archetypical Queens hustler guy and you know but um there, as a driving delivery man I got to see so much of queens and New York City but in particular, the funeral homes around Astoria didn’t realized this they were like listen dude they’re mob fronts. Dan: really Banks: mafia you know the mob there still alive its not like the were in the glory days now they have back then they had the paving uh contracts that they don’t have now but and the carting, the trash, but now its like just the trash in Staten island, but you know the stereotypes come from somewhere sure enough, uh as uh that was one the major impressions of queens still being the kind of country boy from Tennessee uh delivering flowers ot these funeral homes and queens and sure enough there was always a big mike, nick, Gus, and tony and always with the pinky rings and everything and these stereotypes come from somewhere well I got to see it they actually didn’t know what to make of me because I realized now they thought that I was pulling some type of a scam because I was raised to say yes ma’am and no ma’am and please and thank you. Dan: okay Banks and so there’s these tough guys and all that and I’m like yes sir thank you Dan: and they’re just like whoa haha Banks and like you know they thought I was you know, Dan: who is this guy Banks: and then they realize that I was legit so I became friends with them but on Valentines Day I would take like a dozen roses to this I guess mobsters wife. Have you ever seen the movie married to the mob? Dan: yes Banks: okay, well you know what like the set of that so they give the flowers from Charles Florals Dan: the mental picture is there now Banks: and in that interview I saw the movie married to the mob im like oh my god I deliver the flowers to these people and so um lets see I can go down any number of tangents say like talking about the crack epidemic and all that but generally you know what if this is about queens and New York City in general but my love I have a powerful affection for um all of the city. Manhattan, Brooklyn, I lived in bush wick for a while uh and queens and now here, long island city I would go on about that but for me its just the greatest place on earth. And uh its you know not for everyone but for me just like the variety in your diet, you just eat the same thing everyday your body doesn’t have that many vitamins and minerals to choose from Dan: you need a little bit of everything Banks: yeah if you get a variety in your diet then you’re you’re healthier. Well culturally I feel like that while I move out of the United States and move to new york because I’m spoiled now god the variety of culture it uh its uh its very healthy Dan: have you um I know you’ve said when you were delivering flowers, the yes maam and the no maam thing, and that cultural difference, have you noticed that thaths always played like a major factor in your time up in New York City going from Tennessee have you like when you kind of realized like that little thing you always grew up with was different up here? Banks: Oh absolutely and I’ve kind of learned to capitalize but not exploit it or anything but to realize that this was an asset I had because the uh mob and once they realized that I wasn’t making a game and that I was legit they appreciated it and also just we even had a lot of money we weren’t upper middle middle class or rich and all that but I never got any inheritance or anything like that but but to be raised ot have manors is like id rather have that than have been given a trust fund. It has served me so well in New York City because its for a real its not nay kind of calculated agenda its just uh yeah there is uh you know I say stereotypes come from somewhere well southern hospitality it comes form somewhere Nashville has a reputation for being a very friendly town and I feel and yes respect and yeah just the yes maam and no maam Dan: even driving from Ohio to New York when you drove that girl here, do you think that, well that kind of goes off the southern hospitality thing who else would do that you know? Banks: well I’m uh you know that’s a, maybe I’m a freak Dan: Do you think you would have came to New York City if it wasn’t for that or uh do you think it was a turning point Banks: yeah you know come to think of it if it hadn’t had been that, something else would have brought me here and that uh almost like a chemical reaction I don’t know if you’re familiar with the book the secret, well its this fundamental philosophy about the law of attraction that like combines with like. Uh like meets like, and whatever you’re about, whatever thoughts you’re putting out, you will find other people with the same thoughts for this harmonic Dan: kind of like you attract what you put out Banks: yeah and so me and New York city uh it was sort of almost an inevitability uh my girlfriend Clare and I you know were talk about oh just how faith had it that we met each other the night we did at this local bar but I got to thinking have we not met that night, we would have met somewhere else in the neighborhood Dan: You truly believe that Banks: yeah so I only mention that that yeah I would have come here because I think its like that harmonic version why I love new york city is because it is a magnet for strivers and uh you know people who are different or very individual uh people how are out of place in Duluth Minnesota or you know sure people who are just too creative for rural culture come here Dan: So you think New York City fosters all that stuff Banks: oh absolutely and that’s what makes it not for everybody you know its just too much work and too much compression for a lot of people but people who its for you know its uh yeah I uh say that they say that oh there is electricity in the air uh its not just a metaphorical thing no our bodies have an electrical system and we have like magnetic field and all that well just the kind of sensation of all these bodies you feel the electricity from all the people and um the uh oh god you know its just electrifying that’s what brings me to new york city is the energy the spirit it’s the most yes a creative place and um Dan: I feel the same way though I’m from believe it or not in New Jersey we have its rural parts so northwest jersey the joke that used to be there is there’s more cows than people in the town I’m from and even today just driving into the city just seeing the skyline and even when I was a kid I still get I still feel that those like chills I still have that overwhelming sensation I understand what you’re saying and that connection um so like your youth growing up in school you said um like do you have any experiences in school especially in terms of like art and everything, how did you actually cause like art obviously brought you into the city the creativity, when you were a child what where did you start realizing like okay art and this creative side this is part of who I am when did you start noticing that and how did you build on that? Banks: Um my as a kid I’m not an artist I’m a painter Dan : are these yours by the way that’s a mustang right? Banks: yes it’s the letters L O V E there and the story on that to digress just to digress as an artist lets a few years back I was working on something and I thought wow if I super impose the letters l o v e as a composition for one of my landscapes I drew this in one of my books to make a part of a universe I made this sketch just arbitrary thinking let me super impose the letters L O V E that’s my mothers yard in Tennessee Dan: oh so that’s actually a real place Banks: it’s a real place and I have made this sketch in my book because I am all about that love is the energy that energy is love that we that this is a manifestation of love uh this is love its alive love is everything im all about it well anyway so I made this and then arbitrarily looked up and saw the E I’m like holy shit here it is this is in real life and I have seen it in my head and that’s like its chilling its like great that’s what I have been trying to say that love is the fabric of the universe Dan: That’s awesome Banks: thanks uh well lets see you know um through my Dan: So yeah growing up and art Banks: oh yeah it wasn’t that I had such a passion for art I just learned to draw at an early age at first I was fascinated by clipper ships like at the age of 5 or 6 and bi-planes, world war 1 bi-planes oh yeah as a little kid we had this encyclopedia and uh this is like 1965 whatever but they had this red illustrated panel of airplanes from world war 1 and world war 2 and as a three year old kid I was engrossed in this and by the age of like 4 or 5 I was not only drawing them but I was taking piece of cardboard and I would cut out and make these bi planes out of a cardboard from a shirt and the other thing too but ill try to speed it up my brother would come home from high school and on his um notebook he had been doodling the cube and perspective and maybe I saw him do it where you take these two and connect it up and boom but so yeah I must have been 4 years old but I started doing that just from his notebook I remember drawing an alarm clock you know with the bell and doing that just like anyway by the age of 6 I was drawing bi planes in 3 point perspective because I would super impose that and uh Harley Davidson choppers and dragsters you know with the blower and all that and that fascinated me I drew them school was always like some sort of punishment for me I would do that the only thing I aced was lunch I would participate and all that but I didn’t like all that and I would draw. It wasn’t so a great love for art uh and but I became a detailed skilled draftsman at an early age and when I got to high school a uh teacher in commercial art said you she said you got no choice she enrolled me in three hours of commercial art uh 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade I was a commercial art every day and I got a scholarship to CCAD Columbus College of Architect and Design in Columbus Ohio a very good school and I learned fundamental of deign and that was the first time I had been really like taught how to paint learned some painting in highs school the basic shapes and fundamental things but as far as painting and you know it still wasn’t painting for the love of painting or anything like that I uh went to CCAD and I majored in industrial design okay and fine, but then uh you know it was a very tough school and tough course I made it through the first year but uh for whatever reason I withdrew and moved, I graduated High school in 1980 and at that time my mother she had been divorced since I was 12 we were a close family and all that uh but she remarried in 1980 to a man in Birmingham Alabama so in 1982 I was overloaded at CCAD with the industrial design and I bailed I moved in with my mother in Birmingham and I was like well ill get my academic credits so I went to the university of Alabama Birmingham and um in part of my academic credits was American literature and uh also I enrolled in painting there. Went from a professional art school structure where its very serious CCAD is the sister school of the art institute of Chicago they have the same curriculum and the same foundation here so I go down to Birmingham Alabama and it’s a bunch of doctors wives who have started a painting class but the instructor Dr. Edith Crower, not Dr. but Edith Crow she was a very good teacher and uh I got into the painting class but at the same time American literature I started reading Flannery O’Connor I don’t know if you’re familiar with the author Dan: I heard of the name Banks: Well the main thing is that main writers like John Steinbeck and uh they use allegory and symbolism you know the story is about one thing but if you read between the lines its making a big comment on the whole human condition. Flannery O Connor uh did that an I uh it was just part of American literature to read these short stories it turned us on to symbolism and the language of you know the metaphor and all that but I would say that Flannery O Connor influenced me more as a painter than even like my favorite painters like Monet Dan: Really? Banks: yeah uh because she if you just give somebody a fact it just goes in one ear and out the other but if you give them a riddle and they have to solve it then it sticks with them and its this “ah ha” moment for example Flannery O’Connor in some of her stories say she is describing a um farm house with the fence around it and an out building and another field around that and a tree line around that she describes it but then you realize she’s describing the solar system the moon and that its like ah haaaa and it blows your mind so I started uh when I left university of Alabama Birmingham left Alabama left my mothers house moved back to Columbus Ohio and went back to CCAD and as taking fine art paintings I scrapped industrial design part of the thing was look you’ll end up in a cubicle designing cafeteria trays for delta airlines ya know this is the work in commercial design until you get up in the work designing cars you’ll be designing medical equipment and stuff and like ill go with the fine art ya know actually just because I needed something to say I’m doing. Dan: that’s why I’m in school haha Banks: yeah lets see and uh girlfriend in Birmingham and um her father was a very famous physicist and was the astronomy professor at University of Alabama Birmingham and at the time he was a celebrity because he had been in Omni Magazine he and his colleague were the authors of uh the concept of the black hole and he was mentioned in that. But he synthesized stardust in a laboratory and that put him on the book by analyzing the light structure whatever he made some chunks in like this is what a stars made and uh he was a man who was raised by his grandparents in Germany and they never picked him up that was like no love he was a brilliant scientist but rotten father and his daughter they had sort of a violent relationship well anyway my time in Birmingham was occupied by all that and this girl screwed up and you know she was a good girl and very intelligent but she she was sticking her head in the gas oven like once a month and just it was you know this isn’t where I wanted to go with this but finally after a couple years of me trying to be the white knight and and save somebody well uh it’s a cool apartment I go out of town I Tuscaloosa my car breaks down I spend three days in the parking lot changing the timing chain on a chevy 350 station wagon in a parking lot I did that oh my god and put the thing back together I was black and it still didn’t start and the guy at the gas station went hold on finally pulls out the distributor pulls out the rotor and gets another and pops it in and it turns yeah it wasn’t the timing chain that I replaced anyway I get back to my cool apartment on the side of the hill in Birmingham and Celeste is moving in and uh oh my go well anyway I can mainly go on that but I finally left Birmingham Alabama because I like needed to get away from this girl who you know is no animosity or anything like that but its just I was just like I need to leave the state and uh anyway I call her up are you alright you’re not going to kill yourself and she was like oh by the way I am shagged up with Eddy my best friend you know I mean im thinking shes going to kill herself but I take off and she is with our best friend and I learned a lesson you know what you cant be the white knight but me to digress on that but that’s what took me out of Birmingham and that part to back to Columbus Ohio and I was in Columbus Ohio for a couple years doing the painting and working at specialty sports cars where I was the stable boy for exotic cars they had 3 GT40s which is if you know are very exotic cars and oh god all these old Ferraris and Lamborghinis and jaguars. They used to do a lot of ground up restoration on Jaguars. Well when you do that all the parts are sand blasted and spray-painted and that’s what I did. I didn’t turn the wrench but I did everything else. Love cars I still love cars my blood type is 10w40 but um so well try to keep it concise lets see uh so yeah that brought me to Columbus for a couple of years I was uh dating a girl and that was you know I don’t know fading out went to visit Birmingham for a long summer and then I just come back from Columbus and was just about to get settled back in and that’s when the girl said give me a ride and and this was in 1986 and then so I had totally moved back into my apartment and was like you know what don’t let me down, which I didn’t and uh Dan: Did you have any like I know that a part of you you always knew you planned on coming back to New York was there ever that voice in your head or butterflies in your stomach where you were just like oof or where you dead set on it like you didn’t care? Banks: nah I uh I didn’t expect to but I told her that when I came up here and went to Washington square park uh and then I met the street musicians that took me to um a got me involved in this improve theatre also there was a girl there I developed a crush on, and uh some of my friends who I gone to art school with in Columbus who at that time were working with Mark Gostavi who was a painter who employed all he did was sign the work, this was part of his shtick, is that he didn’t make it, he hade a factory of people who made the work, it was his idea they would paint and he would sign it and it was a splash in the pane in the 80s. I thought and there was a possibility that I would work with him in the factory and then I met this girl and as far as the new york city, well just those factors well everything fell into place on top of the love that I always had for new york city and um and uh it just yeah was my big ah ha moment I mean it was I knew it once I started to do it but it hadn’t been my plan if it hadn’t been for that girl saying to come up here once I got up here then I was like ahh there’s the answer that was it like that’s what I wanted to do and uh then I always also thought that I would make my mark on the art world but the world in general and visions and uh I see now that we all do that you know I came up here like I want to have my paintings in the metropolitan museum in my lifetime or the Whitney or the MOMA any of the big ones I wanted to do this to prove im a big painter and all that uh I uh still have these ambitions but that’s not what drives me I narrowed it down about uh as an artist my greatest creation is myself and let me be the art be the beauty let me be the creative force and if I make a painting great fine but I’m the art and I think that’s true for all of us too we think that the legacy that we leave the impact we make on life is fine, philanthropically organizations these big facades you know that people leave a legacy that’s fine and legit but I believe that the wake that you make when you walk down the street the look that you exchange in every persons eyes that is your legacy and who you are right now in any given day and we don’t realize how the ripple that you make in the pond reaches the distant shore and the waves that you enjoy. Dan: no project aside I think that’s not only just for an artist to live what they do but in general I don’t think, I think part of it is associated with your upbringing and everything but I think now more than ever thing of live what you want to be type thing isn’t that common and I think that’s something that should be more apparent that’s awesome Banks: I never put a lot of stock in like reincarnation or but ive been told that maybe im an old soul and I’m starting to see that now because uh I just my perspective uh is well just that I’ve come up with something like that I used to be so ambitious about maybe more material things and um Dan: kind of a bigger picture thing? Banks: more isn’t in yeah and uh I’m very happy with uh my evolution Dan: I like that world evolution Banks: yeah um and uh I have been I guessed in trusted with a lot of real gifts that I feel like I wouldn’t have given a combination of what I love and been given this because I’m not selfish I don’t give it away I don’t you know I care about all the treasures in this world they’re great and legit and all that but its all like the same man I’ve invested in what I can take with me this is uh this is for everyone the joys of my heart and my memories is solid and no one can ever take it away I can take it with me haha. I guess I do I guess I say I’m a freak because from an early age I thought about what is death death means to cease to exist and I think at the age of 12 you cant cease to exist when you already exist I never believed in death Dan: it’s a good way to look at things Banks: yeah a good um well and now I mean it was kind of a vague thing and now I um do I’m very comfortable to see that this 100 years span we have this incarnation on planet earth is the moment of many moments. One time I saw a liter of pups they hadn’t even opened their eyes like running around and trying to find the right teat and I just watched them and they all have distinct personalities these things are right out of the box some of them are one way some of them are the other way. And Im like we come to this planet already a complete package of who we are and just seeing the liter of puppies that started me onto it and now since I have kind of researched it more I do realize for years I thought that this was just a mind inside a body that was me harvest the radio playing inside I even made a series of paintings there’s a house with just a light of the TV on and I called it “The mind inside the body” that light of the TV inside the house is like the speaking mind inside the physical person and yeah for years I thought I was uh a mind in a body and now I realized there’s something that precedes that and realized that I was me when I was born and I will be me when I am gone. And uh I love that there’s an unknown Dan: You like that mystery? Banks: Sure and I have learned the most counter intuitive things to trust complicity what you cannot see what you cannot control. Even uh counter intuitive things and yes grateful for all circumstances and you are a master of yourself which means I call it “Oh boy flat tire” no body wants a flat tire and you can say its purely circumstantial you know its not god saying “you’re going to have a flat now” or is it? Now I do see that the house is rigged this is my own opiate but yes that flat tire kept you out of a 10 car pile up yes that flat tire that you’re so pissed off about has altered the timeline and kept you from dying and you’ll never know it. But somehow I see it and I know and I am able to especially appreciate when things happen and trust it. Dan: I like that I think everybody should see the good and the bad Banks: Since doing that my life has changed completely it takes the sting out of the hard times and when you are at your lowest and you are on the corner of this sucks and I’m fucked, if that time you can look up at the sky and say thank you, its powerful. If you can do that, nothing can touch you, and hell I have been through this I was so lonely but to continue on my queens and New York story uh shoot a girl who I was with, Cornelia the dancer, we broke up and then I was single for a couple of weeks and then I met Laura Cronenberg. We saw each other at the club and instantly, I asked her if she wanted to dance she stood up, and we started making out immediately. And uh I was like I am going to go warm up my car, it was January and she said she was going to go get her friends a cab fair, turns out she was about 15 years older than me and she was part of the andy Warhol scene and she was at Woodstock and she was in touch with whoever was still alive a lot of these Andy Warhol underground people died in the early years from debauchery and all that and the ones who were still alive she was in contact with she saw me as an artist and she was like, I quit my job and she had the money and we lived in park avenue south and uh we were together for about 18 years but in that time I made a series of paintings from they were an allegorical and metaphorical paintings like this American paradise, we can go into it but I have a lot of paintings oh yeah the muscle car, that’s a boss mustang, an American super power, America used to be the boss, the tire there has a letter E for eagle which if you read between the lines it says good year saying it was a Goodyear sort of that Flannery O’Connor symbolism that like the good year tire, hello good year boss Mustang, America the Boss, but anyway I uh did a series of paintings and made uh and started making my way in the art world at one man shows and uh Woodstock, one man shows at the Girshman gallery in New York City and other group shows and um it was uh some press it was making a debut into the art world still known was running with some artists who are now quite famous, uh Richard Hamilton, there’s a man named Rene Ricard who has been instrumental in getting uh the who is the artist, black dude who did the graffiti he did I cant believe, um yeah so but anyway I was uh I kind of burnt out on it I had these expectations to sell my paintings for a couple thousand dollars, there was a big art bubble in the 80s and people were selling and do some miserable thing and sell it for a lot but I was petered out I was working really hard on these big paintings and then selling, didn’t even want to sell them but had to sell them to get not for money but to get it out on people walls and I uh eventually burnt out on it and quit painting sort of, its not making me happy this art scene you know uh I am going to hang it up until it I enjoy the process I was doing it for the wrong reasons I was doing it it prove I’m this painter and this and that it wasn’t making me happy si I will stop. I also was an alcoholic, well from staying up all night and drinking all night, I never got a hangover because I would do a hairy dog, which wound up to me not getting drunk but to me drinking, yeah until that caught up with me. Laura uh lets see we moved to park avenue uh to Bush wick because rent got so high and park avenue was real nice we had a good run there, 19th street in park avenue south in Newton square, right next to High Times magazine and the staff would come over and uh party at 4/20 in our apartment, I did the poster for the cannabis cup and they sent me and Laura to Amsterdam to be judges for the cannabis cup, I had some real high points uh the last few years in Bushwick it kind of went downhill and i was an alcoholic and I was taking drugs along with that I got busted going out to get drugs and then I could have fought the case but I knew I was a bad alcoholic and uh if I didn’t have a drink by noon my hands would shake I wasn’t eating and all that so when I got busted and the fingerprints down, the cop booking me said “Boy, this is the best thing that ever happened to you” Dan: That goes back to the good and the bad thing as well Banks: yeah I was like uh god this is going to suck and yeah soon I took treatment instead of incarceration because they had a shaky case but if I had gone to trial and lost I would be a big felon and be unable to vote and that was a primary thing I didn’t want to lose my right to vote my father was 1st Marine Division in World War 2 and I grew up with these two worlds, the Beatles, and Psychedelic, and all you need is love, and my father, who World War 2 hero, stories about him he was in four major actions uh in the pacific and anyway I have a great love for this country and our freedom. Dan: it shows in your paintings too Banks: and uh yes, many times, and at the same time I mean I’m very patriotic but I still have my own thing Dan: it’s a good balance Banks: yeah so anyway I uh didn’t want to lose my ability to vote and uh I got shipped off to treatment, which was good Laura died while I was in treatment and uh I was devastated, and um got through treatment and uh sobered up my health came back moved back to Nashville in 2010 and uh moved back to Nashville New York had kicked my ass, sent me back to Momma with my hat in my hand and my tail between my legs and uh I hated leaving New York but I had to go back home and start over uh and um and I did start over as a stage hand racket ive been doing stage handing up here but I was an alcoholic I didn’t show up drunk, but just from all those saturated and when I would sweat I would smell and they were like we love you and you work hard but clients smelling you we cant have you around and um I got back into stage handing and worked my way up uh and in Nashville it doesn’t pay that much stage handing because its not union and there’s a huge supply of people who want to be roadies so if you don’t like this, if you don’t want to take this job, there’s somebody who will, anyway worked my way up, oh here’s the main thing is that when I got out of treatment and my head was clear no drinking or all that I started to get back into painting but why do it and uh I felt like all my what I call narrative paintings that I do with a story people are like “Banks tell us about the B story tell us about this” ill tell you what come in here and take that ill show you the narrative part okay and as carry on with the story I switched over to uh I decided I was going to paint with light okay this is narrative this is called the “Immaculate Reception” but see, it’s a peace sign the base, and I made this the berlin wall had recently come down this is an old painting and uh I realized that the Berlin wall came down because uh they had been trying to keep the culture out and all that but the satellite dish goes over the fence and all of a sudden this country wants Levis, they want John Wayne, they want Rock and Roll they want Coca Cola and you cant stop, and I see all the dished divide into the seven sections to represent the seven seas, you know this is just an example of my narrative work and uh like the boss mustang these are all from my imagination I just worked in the studio from a room with no reference its sort of narcissistic and as like like a drummer walking back to the studio to get his chops I’m like you know what I don’t want my voice involved in this you know let me get back to the fundamental painting of color and all that yeah I have this thing the only energy that comes off a painting is the energy that goes in and like why do it so this I had this epiphany when I got off drugs and alcohol why do it I realized I will only paint something if I love it. There’s something that I love, then it comes easy. This is a new one behind you, that’s Annabelle bison, and I don’t know if you can see the uh on the smokestack there there’s a candle and that is a video projection of a candle right there and uh Annabelle Bison is nearby over here and its going to be and they’re going to build a 90 story high rise where that factory is and my motivation is well let me go there and paint the sky while you can still see the sky and I get down there and I realize they have been videotaping this candle on there and I love the smokestack all the magnificent things that’s an example but I only paint things that I love and since then I don’t want to go into showing you my work and all that but this is a day I spent in France, this is is Central Park and it has meaning to me because at this particular spot it actually that girls name is Silvia and there’s a bunch in there you cant see, that’s Dennis who I have a relationship with and its deeply personal to me and actually I realized that I painting form life I realized that if I look at the painting later years later, because I remember every stroke, it teleports me back to that day and its always warm sunny days and I realize I’m not making a I’m illustrating my own life and that is and New York City factors into it so much I am making a its like trying to photograph a ghost that the spirit of New York City is, oh yeah I learned to, painting from life, I still have my narrative I still have my voice but I want to let just what I choose to paint tell its own story and that’s my narrative but here is an example, hello, alright, Long Island City, Dan: So while youre doing that, you actually hit on all the questions I wanted to talk to you about, Banks: Okay this is Bethesda fountain in central park, but you see that these angels is looking at the stops, she is perpetually looking at the stop light, I am like that is it! New York City, where the angels even have to wait. Its and so I’m able to have my voice but without it being over loud and I am continuing on that y affection for my subject matter and the piece I get into a sort of Zen like state when I am working because I am grateful for what is before my eyes I look at what we consider ordinary is extraordinary and just what is I can take the mundane and elevate it its spectacular I do it amplify it by talk about being in harmony with nature when I am painting a tree I am ingesting it I feel like Godzilla eating Tokyo I feel like Godzilla eating every tree and branch and through my hand I do live in harmony with it and that uh peace that I find when I am working is my expression for my love of creation its alive and its human nature but we cant help but take it for granted somehow talking about this gift this key I don’t take it for granted another thing is recovering from my addiction and alcoholism had I not gotten busted I probably wouldn’t be here now, alcohol can kill you. And so I have always been an optimist its not that bad ill do alright now looking back it sucked and so I was in a very dark place my self esteem when I went back I felt so worthless after being a child very mellow hearing you’re the next Da Vinci you’re the next Michelangelo like great this is a wrap then I get to be in my 20s and I realize maybe im not this I have to work for it its not here I don’t know Dan: Yeah so going off that, you hit every one of my questions by the way, that was awesome I didn’t even have to ask you just, it was such a natural flow that’s exactly what I wanted but, the last question I have, in two sentences, since we were talking about the past so much, what’s next for you, where do you see yourself? Banks: Okay, if I boiled it down, Dan: all this past talk, what do you look for in the future, so Banks: Sure, thank you Dan: Like 2 maybe 3 sentences, Banks: Okay, metaphorically speaking, I want to put together a string of work, powerful thought, and carve it into stone, my legacy. I see I am able to do that with the help of circumstance with love and uh so what I want from the future well is to carve into a powerful thought, okay what I want from the future, yeah is to hmm, good question, well you know what to feel as as good as I feel now the energy I feel now, and be in good spirits, I am in good spirits, in art, and mind, my place for the future is to continue to enjoy the journey and my life is ongoing science fair project in that we are born we came here from our cosmic travel and you take a step sort of off the planet and look at the totality of your 100 years on earth and think of it as one moment of many moments so my time here on earth, oh yeah you’re born and your memory is wiped out, I remember, I actually do remember being in the crib, and I remember vividly from a year and a half onto it also I had this repressed memory for years and then it dawned on me about 7/8 years ago that I realized what that memory was I remember being circumcised uh I remember being like the pain you know but being completely disoriented. This is why I remember this I was like what the fuck is going on where am I, what is happening and it was dark and all that, I realized dude, that was when I was circumcised and then I don’t remember anything from when I was a year and half old and then I remember vividly from that I mention that because I remember being at that age and yeah you’re memory is wiped clean and along the journey this 100 years we have you remember who we are and even create yourself and that is the thing I think of it this way Its funny my name is Clayton, Clayton is my last name and I looked it up and Clay-Ton is like tun a Tun is a vessel or a like an earth structure a Clay- Ton so I am an earthen Vessel. Dan: I want to end it right there I like that Banks: Good ha-ha great ",

Her journey began in Brooklyn, but continued onto neighborhoods in Queens. She has spent her life being a mother, sister, wife, and educator in the Queens / Brooklyn Catholic school system. Family is a central theme throughout her interview. (00:46) Nina Cucchiara was born in Sicily, Italy. She describes her life in Italy as a happy and comfortable. Nina�s mother was depressed because her mother (Nina's grandmother) was living in the United States. This made their family life difficult as Nina was often in the care of relatives. Her mother's sadness is major reason why the entire family chose to immigrate to the United States. She goes on to tell her grandmother's story of being born in Nashville and moving to Italy where Nina's mother was born. Her grandmother moved back to the United States, leaving Nina's mother alone in another country. She then details life in Italy and her father's decision to move to the United States. (04:59) Nina discusses the immigration process; obtaining passports and vaccinations. Her father was unhappy about his choice to move to the United States; however, he wanted his wife to be reunited with her mother. Her father always planned to return to Italy. Although not pleasant, the immigration process ran smoothly for her family. They came to the United States by passenger ship called the Cristoforo Colombo. She details her experience on the ship. Their passage took place in March from March 9th to March 21st 1966. (08:21) Nina was happy to arrive in the United States and to meet family that she had never met.

She recalls her time in school and her experience being the only Italian girl in her class. No one was able to help her learn English, and so she had to rely on herself. Once she transferred schools, she met more recent Italian arrivals and had a much easier time learning English. Her mother and sisters learned English, but her father refused to learn the language, as he always felt he was going to return to Italy. (18:38) Nina discusses her first return to Italy which happened forty years later. During her trip, she learned a troubling and sad story about her family's past that may have contributed to her mother' depression. She had a brother who died that she and her siblings knew nothing about. (27:29) Nina remembers the concept of kids playing in the street in the United States as something very new to her. This was especially a shock with all of the cars in the street. Because she lived in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, she didn�t experience that much culture shock. She recounts the riots that broke out after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She discusses the rift between blacks and whites. (30:15) Nina remembers how she and her siblings wanted to be more like other American teenagers, but her father remained very traditional and strict.

  "Cuervo_Isabel_timecode.txt": "“Leaving the neighborhood was a measure of success and it was really difficult for me to accept that I had to come back.” Isabel Cuervo has lived in Sunnyside since she was six, but had to travel halfway around the world before she could appreciate the neighborhood. Growing up as the daughter of a Colombian single mother in a one-bedroom apartment wasn’t easy. Isabel was not allowed to play on the street or walk to school by herself because her mother was “overprotective.” She often dreamed of owning one of the “pretty, little houses” beyond Skillman Avenue, the virtual border that still largely separates the working class from the middle class. After high school, Isabel began studying different architects’ approaches to low-income housing at Barnard College and later enrolled in a Master’s program for environmental psychology in Spain. “I always wanted to travel the world,” the 35-year-old says. But Spain wasn’t what she had hoped, and Isabel returned to Sunnyside, broke and pained. “I felt like my life wasn’t progressing,” she says. “Leaving the neighborhood was a measure of success and it was really difficult for me to accept that I had to come back.” In 2003 Isabel began her PhD studies in environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center, which slowly changed her feelings towards Sunnyside. Isabel now appreciates the neighborhood’s small town feel, its accessibility and diversity. “It’s not in the middle of all that chaos that can be New York City.” Isabel’s doctoral thesis combines her two main interests, traveling and low-income housing. She recently spent three months in Bogotá, Colombia, interviewing key stakeholders of low-income housing, including residents, developers and representatives of city agencies. She hopes her research will contribute to a better understanding between these divided parties and improve the living conditions of working class families. As to Sunnyside, Isabel has found a good reason to return: One year ago she fell in love with a man who grew up on the same block as she. Her new boyfriend is the son of Turkish immigrants and was one of the children she envied because he was allowed to play on the street. “Sometimes I feel like in ‘The Godfather,’ ” Isabel says laughing. “The main character wants to leave the mob but he is always being pulled back in. This is the story of my life with this neighborhood.” ",

  "DePaola_Frank_timecode.txt": "My name is Frank DePaola and we are in Sorriso Salumeria. We�ve been here for 33 years, and we specialize in hard-to-get items. Cheese, fresh-baked breads, sausages, meats, whatever you need. I was born in Calabria. I came over here when I was eight years old and have been here ever since. We moved to Long Island and then we came here to Astoria. It used to be quiet [this part of the street] until I got here! We support each other. We have the bakery, the liquor store, and we all support each other. Most of them have [been here as long as we have]. I have importers that we use. Sometimes people want a special item and I ask them to bring it in for me and they do. Nothing�s hard to get anymore. It�s actually easier to get stuff from Europe than it was 10 years ago. Everything is computerized, everything is faster, it doesn�t take as long to approve labels and everything. My personal food favorite food here has got to be a homemade mozzarella. You�ll have to try some. We make it every hour. We also do a lot of catering, a lot of prepared foods as you saw. We have a whole showcase-full. If someone walks in off the street and needs a piece of lasagna, a couple of meatballs, we put it together, you know. Our catering is really good, we do a lot of catering. We do parties, we do Kaufman Studios, we do Silver Cup. We�ve been here 33 years. My wife doesn�t work here with me. Better that way! For some customers I�m on my third generation. Yeah. I have the grandparents, and the kids coming here and now the kids are coming here with their kids. It�s nice to see people grow, and have their own families. It�s rewarding. Not yet! [nothing that find a challenge so far]. I love this business so I don�t consider it coming to work every day. I love food, and I love everything about it. And I love creating food. The Italian community here used to be bigger. They�ve gotten older, they�ve moved away, some went back to Italy, some left us. But we do have a lot of their children here now coming with their children. And we also have an influx of younger people moving into the neighborhood � 25, 35 years old, young professionals. They know good food, they love good food, they�ve been brought up on the food network so they already know what to expect when they come in to buy something. Especially with the computer�people know where to come. Like we�re on Yelp, so that guy who was just here, he was going to the airport, and he typed in Italian food and we came up. He was from Texas and he was on a layover. And that�s happened quite a few times. So everything is faster than I remember it years ago. As my son says, �Dad it�s the computer age.� I mean I�m not a computer guy. But yeah, absolutely [it helps the business]. Twice as fast. We�re open seven days a week. I�m off on Wednesdays and the rest of the time I�m here. So I give a lot to the store. 190%. That�s why I�ve been here so long because I�m on top of everything. You have to be. I mean I can leave, my son�s with me now, he just finished college so he�s with me now. So I can relax just a little bit. But I�m doing something else! It�s like when I�m off, I�m out getting stuff, or I�m going to the bank, you know it�s always something. I haven�t been back to Italy since I�ve been here. But I do plan to do that. It was 1966 we came. I could leave seven to ten days but I�m so attached I can�t leave! My wife says I�m crazy, but it�s my passion, I love it. This has been my dream, so�why not? ",
  "Dermansky_Marcy_timecode.txt": "My name is Marcy Dermansky, I�m a writer, and we�re at the Athens caf� on 30th Avenue. I don�t plan my novels all that much or work with an outline. I just work really hard for a long period of time and write what comes into my head. I used to have a daily writing schedule and a writing office and a plan. Since I now have a seventeen month-old daughter I don�t have a process right now. But I�m hoping to get one. If I have a lot of energy at night when she�s asleep I might write at night, but I don�t do anything on a regular basis any more. So far I feel like I haven�t done anything all that wrong [representing a two year old accurately before having a child of her own, in the novel Bad Marie]. I think if I were writing it now I might not feel as much sympathy towards the Marie character, because she does something so bad [run away with the child she�s looking after]. People make jokes about my babysitters running off with Nina � and well, [you don�t find them so funny?] No�So I think maybe it would have been harder to write her if I had had a child of my own. My friends with little babies read that book and it makes them uncomfortable. Getting published is definitely one aspect of success. I think that it�s when you get to the end of a novel, when you read anybody�s book not just mine, and if the end works for you, if you read it and you think �that�s right�. Sometimes I like to make people cry with my work. That�s always the best thing you can do. There�s an anthology that�s coming out called Forgotten Borough � Writers Come to Terms with Queens [pub. by SUNY Press]. And that�s the first time I�ve written about Queens. I set the short story in a place called Caf� Bar on 34th Avenue, which is a place that I love. So when I had to write about Queens that�s what I chose. But I think with fiction a lot of times you write about a place after you�ve left it. So I�ll probably write more about Queens when I live somewhere else. I�ve lived in Astoria for ten years. I certainly didn�t know I�d be here for this long. I came to New York and people said �move to Queens�, it�s happening and its cheap. And we like it so we�ve stayed and we�ve moved a couple of times around here. I was brought up in Inglewood New Jersey. But I lived in San Francisco, and then I lived in New Orleans, and then came home. I actually lived in Dominican Republic for a bit too. My husband had a job translating for a funny company, a little start-up translating company. So I just wrote. I had a year of not working, and worked on a book when I was there and went swimming. My husband�s German so we go there a little bit. Alongside my own writing work I edit people�s manuscripts � so short stories and novels � and I love doing that kind of work. I can do it at home and in my own time, and it�s perfect for when you have a baby. I�ve been doing that for a couple of years now. I also write film reviews for a website. So it�s busy, especially with Nina. Sometimes I think it would be so much easier if I had a job, and could go. Working from home and having a baby means not working. So I�m playing around with that. The first idea is always the hardest thing for me. What I like about writing novels is that they�re long. Once you have the idea, you can just write for a couple of hundred pages. Every day when you start working you have this book and you keep writing it. With short stories you finish them so quickly and then you need to have the next idea. The hardest time for me as a writer is when you finish a novel. Because to start a new novel is very daunting for me. The ideas just come. I don�t believe in inspiration: I don�t have a gazillion ideas. I have to just force myself to sit in front of my computer and force myself to work, and then an idea will come. But I don�t normally start with an idea raring to go. I just have to force it. Astoria is very community oriented. And I�ve particularly liked it since having a baby. I�ve almost liked Queens and Astoria more since having Nina than before, which you wouldn�t necessarily expect. Suddenly I know my neighbors a lot more, I keep meeting mothers with strollers. People are so warm and helpful. The restaurants are good, the people are interesting. And the rents are really good. I think that�s a good reason isn�t it? I mean, we live on the top floor of a house � that�s nice. I love it when my characters just do something. Like in Bad Marie, Marie goes to Paris. I didn�t know she was going to do that until she went there. My characters start making decisions without my planning it, because I don�t plan. And that�s really fun, because they become these creatures in my head that just do things. My stories entertain themselves while I write them. Sometimes I get upset when I write them if bad things happen but I just go through it. It�s fun. I like what they say. ",
  "DiMaria_Tina_timecode.txt": "Tina DiMaria was born in 1970 in Queens, New York. She lived in Woodhaven, Queens in a two-family home until she was fifteen years old and then moved to a house in Howard Beach, Queens. Tina talks about growing up in Woodhaven, recalling her most profound memories and changes in the neighborhood from 1970 to 2017. She ends the interview by talking about her thoughts and hopes for the future of the areas she lived in including Woodhaven and Howard Beach. 00:01:09 Tina has lived in Woodhaven, Queens for the most part of her childhood before moving with her family to Howard Beach, Queens. She says she had wonderful friends and neighbors in both parts of Queens. 00:02:50 Tina talks about her memorable next door neighbor. She recalls Mrs. Morris baking cookies, playing old time music, and having a good time. She refers to Mrs. Morris as a “wonderful, wonderful person”. 00:04:00 Tina describes the diversity of both of the neighborhoods she lived in. She says Woodhaven was more diverse (there were more Hispanics moving in) while Howard Beach consisted of a majority of Italians. 00:04:55 Tina explains the changes in Woodhaven from her childhood to now. She says the candy store from when she was a child is “not as clean” to this date. She adds she will not feel comfortable living in Woodhaven now. 00:07:08 Tina talks about the schools she attended as a child and teenager and says they were better back then. 00:09:27 Tina recalls her childhood in Woodhaven when her block would have parties every summer. The street would be blocked off so the childhood could run in the streets freely until eleven at night. There would be barbeque, music and the fire hydrants would go off. She says she had a lot of fun with her neighbors. 00:10:14 Tina says that children these days, such as her daughter, do not have the same experience socializing since technology has taken over their social lives. When she was growing up she would play games such as kick the can, stoop ball, and other outdoor activities with her friends. 00:11:22 Tina would love for Woodhaven to change, however, she does not see a change occurring for the better in the near future.

  "Dimola_Audrey_timecode.txt": "Khylla Watson: My name is Khylla Watson. Today is October 5th, 2018. I am in Astoria, New York, with Audrey Dimola. Okay, so, what is your earliest childhood memory? Or, what was life like at home as a child? Audrey Dimola: Totally, oh my god. Always taking trips to wonderful places. But only a couple times on an airplane to Florida. But, as soon as you said that I just always think of a memory of being outside of my house. Its summer time, like, you can smell the black top. And there’s just this smell of summer. My dad’s car and just all of us getting in. I think that’s my one the reasons why I love the Triborough Bridge so much, the Art of Gay Bridge. Just the trips that we would take. We would go to, you know, amusement parks, or go visit family. So, always have memories like that and just being able to enjoy my family. Our house has lots of history. The house itself is from the late 1800s. So, even before my family got there, but literally so much of my family’s history is in this house. My father emigrated from Polignano, in Italy with his family, well he was taken with his family because he was one years old, so he didn’t make the choice. And so, they ended up on 9th street at first, and then moved to the house that we still have. My grandfather owned it then my father inherited it and so he grew up there and then he moved in downstairs with my mother later on. When they were engaged, they were living there you know and then started their family there, you know, myself, my brother and sister all grew up there. So, there’s so much in that house and just yeah. I feel like, why does summer time come up so much as soon as you ask me my earliest memory? And being in our backyard. We have this, like, cute little backyard space and I’m a summer baby so that Queens backyard pool life with the little kiddie pool and playing in the sprinkler. Khylla Watson: Is it far from here? Is your childhood home far from where you live right now? Audrey Dimola: Thankfully its not. Yeah, so it’s on 33rd road and Vernon. Its one of only two houses, now three, because they built a house in the property, and actually, in the front yard they built another house for their daughter or something, our neighbors. But there’s only two houses, and we’re right across from the Noguchi Museum. So, that’s also a part of my family history. My dad worked at the gas station that existed there before the Noguchi Museum even existed. So, he swept the street for Noguchi, this world-famous artist, because no one knew who he was then. Khylla Watson: Have you been there? To the museum? Audrey Dimola: Yeah and my dad is close with them. And also, where I work currently, Socrates Sculpture Park, is really close by also. So, growing up there, now in that area, so much is coming up, you know and that’s what we’re seeing in Astoria. These old houses being ripped down and like mini condos being built in spaces between, you know, old nice houses. Lots of gentrification in that area because it used to be super quiet also, somewhat unsafe, you know, and now there are, yeah, there’s condos all the way down Vernon Boulevard, there’s more coming up all the time. A Costco exists now, right near us. There’s, cafés, which is crazy, because it used to feel like no-mans-land you know and when Noguchi and Mark di Suvero founded Socrates, that’s how it felt over there, you know, just this, like, this green oasis, and this artistic oasis in this pretty much just like straight up industrial area, with warehouses and desolate streets. Khylla Watson: So, what was it like growing up in, as you said, a wasteland environment? Do you think you spent more time with your family then? Audrey Dimola: Oh yeah. Yeah, I would say we definitely had a wonderful life of freedom in our house. Like, we were pretty sheltered, you know. Like, we would play with childhood friends of ours but like with our family there. With my grandmother, my nana, like sitting on the street. You know, we were definitely not kids who were like: here’s this money, go to the store and buy me something. No, it was like, we were a pack and we did everything together or we did everything with my mom. My mom also babysat lots of kids over my entire life, so I’ve had all these like, almost, foster brothers and sisters, right, like all these kids that you get to know. And watched the neighborhood kids, watched, you know, my cousins. So, there was just always kids and life, and like, something happening in our house. It was a house that no one ever wanted to leave. Like kids would literally—I’m like kids—my friends, and family would like hide in the closet and cry because they didn’t want to go home because my mom gave us so much, you know, wonderful freedom. So, it was like, yeah, I guess we didn’t, I didn’t realize, you know, I didn’t realize until I got older and then, you know, started going to college, and like then you’re going out, right, you’re like seeing your friends and then you come home and you’re like hm, I don’t feel safe walking, you know, I’m going to take a cab from the Broadway train because, yeah there’s like this long stretch of blocks from the Broadway train to where we are, generally, take the buses until later. So, yeah and I guess not even realizing, you know, you’re in this space, for your whole life—that’s the thing about me with Queens—even now like I work at Socrates, which is my stomping ground, for my whole life, so you don’t even notice, you know, how quiet the block is, like hearing birds in the trees or just like the characteristics of your, yeah the like, the fiber of your block until, right, you have to move. I haven’t lived anywhere outside of New York. I only lived in Brooklyn for, like, less than a year so I’ve always been here in Queens, but I feel blessed when I can hear birds somewhere. Like, living, myriad living situations. Khylla Watson: Interesting. So, you mentioned your grandparents. Have they ever shared a migration story with you? Because you said they came over from Italy. What was that like? Audrey Dimola: So that interesting because we were not really able to communicate with my dad’s parents and my dad was the last of six; they were farmers and that’s one the reasons why they ended up emigrating because their crops did really badly one year and then they had an opportunity with, you know, my grandfather’s brother, I think, or brother-in-law. So, it was like, wanna go to—wanna go to America? And then, that’s what ended up happening. And there’s, so that is actually really interesting like now being an adult and thinking of this. You know, I’m thirty-two now and I have, uh—my mother’s father is like a little bit, you know, separated or estranged from us, she didn’t grow up with him, so we just have kind of like a friend relationship with him. But in terms of our like real grandparents, they’re all gone. You know, and it’s like, when you’re a kid, you don’t even think of these questions and things you would want to ask. And so, yeah my dad’s parent’s were much older and so we’re like still getting these stories, you know, occasionally, from his brothers or sister, because he was too young to even hold any of these stories, right? He was literally one year old, like I had mentioned to you when they came over from Polignano. Khylla Watson: And he never asked them? Audrey Dimola: And like yeah, like. Maybe, but not—my dad’s an interesting character too, right? Like, the stories that he tells are more, I feel like, about his life in the neighborhood, and you know, and like growing up, being a rock and roller, like, fixing cars you know. Yeah, so my uncles or my aunt, were the ones who kind of told us a little bit about that. But, in juxtaposition to them, and not really being able to communicate with them, aside from like, you know, gestures that you could understand and like, we’re all having dinner together, whatever, my Nana, who is my mom’s mom, was so present in our life, especially in my life. And so, you know, where I was talking about my dad growing up, on you know, 33rd Road and Vernon, literally my mom grew up on 14th Street which was really close by. So, this radius of my life, is literally, like I can be like, that’s where my mom grew up, that’s where my dad grew up, this is where they met, on the stoop, in the pizza store, you know, like, this is where the butcher shop used to be. And it’s like, crazy to have all of these layers—it’s where my cousin used to live, where my Nana used to live. So, they literally met like crossing paths in the neighborhood. As you did, right? I’m like, I guess you could meet the person you’re supposed to marry in the neighborhood, right? So, a lot of uh—yeah so, my dad was the last of six, my mom was the oldest of four. So, my mom was really looking after her sisters and yeah, her grandfather had a butcher shop, so just like, really neighborhoody folks in Astoria. Khylla Watson: So, you talked about growing up, you know, with childhood friends and things like that so what were they like? Did they have the same experience as you growing up or was it kind of different? Being as though, you know, you lived with your family and everyone was in your family, or? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, I mean I remember I was—probably—in elementary school and I went to friend Margaret’s house in Jackson Heights and we got to play man hunt outside and I was like what? Like, no one’s here watching us, we can like run all around and like hide under cars if we want to and like, it like blew my mind, you know? And so, my—yeah, my mom, loves us so exceptionally dearly but it translates into like high anxiety for our life, right? So, those kind of experiences of suddenly like, oh my god freedom, and I remember—super weird—sleeping over my elementary school best friend’s house and this was when Costco was new, right next to our house, and literally like we get into the Costco, and I’m also there with my brother and her younger brother, we were all friends, and her parents were like, go play, just like in the Costco! Like, play hide and seek and like meet up here or whatever and we were like nuts. But like my mom found out after and was like, you could’ve gotten stolen, you know? So, like I feel like we had differences in those ways and like, for me, really coming into my own, as being my own person, took all the way into college because all of my schools were so close. I went to Long Island City High school, which I could see from my living room window, right? Like, when I’m telling you my radius is small, it’s pretty small. Yeah, we got to break out like going on those trips and things like that, you know, but in terms of, you know, yeah, really, you know and you realize more as you get older and then I’m, the fact that I’m like not living in my house with my brother and sister still, or my aunt and uncle moved into that house as well, and you realize wow, we were like really on top of each other, all the time. Khylla Watson: Well what was high school like? Were you in any clubs or activities? Sports? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, definitely. So, I—yeah, I was just a weirdo. Still am! Always just wore whatever I wanted and like no one could really make heads or tails of me, which was really funny, but I was really big in theatre, yeah, and performing and writing and like really kind of made a name for myself with my writing. And yeah, always in the school plays I got to do the English speaking—English Speaking Union of New York Shakespeare Competition—in the city, I got to like to train for that, and then compete against kids from all around the boroughs. Like, I won from Queens, so that was really cool. And yeah, made, you know—friends were the thing that gets you through. I have a lot of, like, anxiety in school also, and just like yeah wanting to do well, stressing out. But yeah, starting to get my little taste of, yeah, following a friend into the city, right? My best friend Nick and I would always hang out in Union Square and just like wander and go into Virgin Mike Store. But, yeah having the high school super close, when you don’t want to think about it, and you could see it out your living room window; not fun. Khylla Watson: Well do you remember the first time that you actually ventured out outside of, as you said, your radius? What was that like? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, oh my god. So that, definitely, you know, college—because there were like a couple different things. There was this guy I started seeing in Staten Island and that was like—end of the world!—like trying to get out there, right? I had to take a ferry, I had to take a bus, you know? And you do a lot of things for love, right? And then of course, yeah I went to school outside of Queens, I went to Hunter College, so like you know just taking the trains by myself the first time, paying for things by myself for the first time, and then escaping to Atlantic City with my best friend without telling my mom where I was going, she thought I was in Sunnyside. He had grown up going there and it’s still our tradition. For my thirty second birthday this year we actually like went back after all these years, so, yeah. Shocking, but like, yeah feeling that, right, self-confidence and power is amazing. And getting out from under the worries that have kind of weighed you down from childhood. Khylla Watson: Well, you spoke about going to college, and going to Hunter College, why did you choose to major in media studies? Audrey Dimola: So, when you love to write! Yeah and we actually were talking about this off the record! Khylla Watson: Was it theatre? Audrey Dimola: Yeah! When you love to write I feel like, you know, at that I time I wasn’t given a lot of options, right? You know, so many of the jobs I’ve even worked in my life, I didn’t know existed! Right? Like right now, I’m like in public programs—like what the hell is that? Right? I was a project manager, what the hell is that? You know, you love to right and then its like ok, be a journalist or be a teacher, right? Be novelist? Like, what do you even do with this, you know? So, I, you know, I didn’t want to do hard news and I love the arts always since I was a kid and so what better than like telling peoples’ stories and you know I loved Rolling Stone, loved music—I was like I want to write for Rolling Stone or Time Out New York—so media studies was the umbrella because they didn’t have like a specific journalism major but sorry to say, I had an awful time in my major in college and I almost was like I’m not cut out for this. A lot of like self-worth stuff and self-doubt came up and I came in thinking I was going to perform, you know, I was a minor in theatre and I like backed out of it, you know, I was just too afraid, you know. And I didn’t perform my own work again until after college. Like, all of college was kind of going dark and really like inside myself and feeling different things but thank God I kind of like came back around to it afterwards. Loved my electives in college! That like, made me live. Khylla Watson: Or—well, you said you minored in English, so? Was that also a saving grace for you as well? Audrey Dimola: Yeah! Oh my God! Being, you know, deep, more deep, more deeply—sorry—more deeply introduced to like Emerson and Thoreau, you know I took a class like, yeah. All these wonderful, literature classes and then like I mentioned, the electives, getting to take mysticism class and architecture, the early renaissance, you know, and archeology and then there was one on Cleopatra in Egypt, crazy. So, all of that was like so enriching for me in a way that sticks with me today. Like, things that I learned in those classes. Like Buddhism, learning about Rumi, the poet. That changed everything. Thank God I didn’t like drop out of college at that time because I couldn’t hack it as a journalist. Khylla Watson: Well you said Thoreau and Emerson. Are those some of your favorite writers or do have any more favorite poets or writers? Audrey Dimola: Oh my God I have so many and I bet they’re all going to like fly out of my head right now. Uh, Fitzgerald was a first. The Great Gatsby, like, I read it over and over since I was in eight grade and its just everything how, just how he constructs sentences. Like he can take the tiniest moment and just extrapolate it into this like beautiful, flowery thing, you know, and I’m just like, how do you do that, you know? And, but, Emerson is like my soul brother, in a way. Like, I love Thoreau as well but Emerson like tops him and tops everyone, really. I even like—I went to—I had a boyfriend who was from the Massachusetts area take me to the grave where Emerson’s buried, where Thoreau’s buried. I’ve seen his house and everything because he speaks from the soul of the world and those are all the writers that I have an affinity with and I realize that, like everyone who has this like mystical, like contingent, to their writing, or like an Eastern influence rather than Western, right, and some kind of yeah, like, metaphysical bent or like that there’s God in nature and that there’s spirit in nature in the world, like that’s who I’m drawn to. So like, Rainer Maria Rilker, Hermann Hesse, Paulo Coelho, who wrote The Alchemist, yeah, Hafez and Rumi, Khalil Gibran, the prophet, and then other folks that I learned of later, like Anais Nin, like, her diaries and how, like, daring she was. Oh my God, her name is flying, Clarice Lispector—is nuts! Like, just these people who are pushing the bounds of the page and just like breaking language apart and doing something different with it and just like infusing life into it. Like speaking of that Emerson class, like it was kind of the first time in my adult life that I felt this like resonance from the universe. Of like—I got chills all over my body and I was like, ok. And now like I have all of those experiences and I like understand it but that was the first time and it was sitting in that class. And my teacher was reading something Emerson wrote about another writer, about Michel Montaigne, and he said, “Cut these words and they will bleed. They are vascular and alive.” And it was just like a lightning bolt and I was like, that is how I need to write! You know, and like all these years later, I feel like I’m going through my own journey and like exposing my own truth and standing in my truth like I feel like I’ve done that. Khylla Watson: Was this a point in your life where you, because you talked about in the pre-interview survey about how much you love to volunteer—was this, when you were in college, was this a point in your life where you realized how much you love to volunteer? Is that when you started volunteering a lot? Audrey Dimola: So, it was after. It’s so strange, it’s like when I think about my college life now, I was like knee deep in relationships, and love and drama and—lets be real—and like working for the first time and having an internship and like trying to like knock out straight A’s, you know I was so like deep in that, and so after college, one of my internships—and this is also what I mentioned in the pre-interview survey—I got this chance internship at this magazine that no longer exists in Long Island City called Ins and Outs and literally, like, I literally think what would have happened if I hadn’t done this because I took a cab to the address, right, and again I’m young, right, I haven’t like done a lot of these situations, and I roll up at the address and its like a warehouse and I’m like this is unsafe, right? And literally, I don’t even know if I called the number, but I was like I don’t see any signs saying Ins and Outs, like I didn’t know that there are studios inside warehouse buildings and like artists and magazines can be inside them. And I like went home. I literally like turned back around and I went home. But then thankfully, I called and I was like, yeah I was at some weird building and she’s like no, no that’s the right building and I went back and I ended up getting hired. So, that was like towards the tail end of college and through that started just getting to know all these people and that was when the volunteering—and it happened, like, in this strange way. Just not even realizing. It’s just like, oh my God I’d really love to help, oh my God yeah, I’d really love live events and just like the all hands-on deck feeling and the energy of it and like we are creating something with our hands for the people. So, it really wasn’t something that I was like consciously even thinking about, you know, this was—a girl that I was close friends with, Liz Nievez, she’s also an Astorian—and she had this magazine called Sugarzine, an online magazine, so we were like on the same paths, but she was like older than me, and so she wanted to start doing events and there was another gentleman that I met, Justin Finley, also an Astorian, and he created Astoria Music and Arts—and so just kind of jumping in with both of them and suddenly, you know, realizing, this is important and this feels right. And to get swept up in a movement of—as I was at the magazine, realizing, oh man Queens is really overshadowed by Brooklyn and Manhattan. Even at the magazine at the time that I was there, I was like, looking at past issues and I’m like, why are we not writing about the people in our neighborhood? Why are we not making this paper local? So, I was like stripping stuff out, you know? And so realizing like I want to carry that banner for my neighborhood, about like that their—let’s find these venues, you know? Like we don’t have Bowery Ballroom and Music Hall Williamsburg, but where are our venues? Where are our artists? Everyone’s just like, there’s no writers here. There’s no musicians here. And I’m like that can’t freaking be true, you know? Maybe it’s harder to find but that [24:27] like galvanized my soul in a way that like literally has led up to this moment. Decades later. Khylla Watson: And what was Ins and Outs Magazine about? What were the articles—what was the content based on? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, so it was an arts magazine. It was a glossy arts magazine. It was free. Costed way too much to produce and did not get returned. It was interesting because it was about everything at the same time because the staff was constantly changing, right, so it was just a chameleon of like amazing, you know, like full colored, glossy spreads, photoshoots, and like in-studios with artists and things around the neighborhood but also stuff from all the rest of the world and kind of like whatever anyone wanted. So, being there I got really tight with the staff—super small and I was like we need to hone this in. So, I, again picking up that banner, of like I want this to be about the arts in Astoria and Long Island City and Queens and if there’s other things, great, but this must be the focus of this. Yeah, so it was just like arts of all kinds: music, theatre, visual arts, painters, film—we had a fashion spread, which was ridiculous for like a local magazine. You know, its like a fashion spread? Alright. Khylla Watson: Well, you know, being as though you had all of those creative juices flowing, did there ever become anything inside you that you wanted to start on your own? Or did you have any ideas? Audrey Dimola: Totally. Khylla Watson: When did you want to venture out? When did that happen? Audrey Dimola: So that’s actually like a perfect point to like pivot off of. Yeah, because as you’re noticing the whole journey at the beginning was writing about other people, I wanted to tell other people’s stories. Like, this is what I’m doing and I want like to make this platform for others, for others, and in one of the Ins and Outs Magazines we had a like little poetry section and I like, threw a poem in, you know, and I was like oh ok, you know. But really again, like Liz, changed the course of my life again, you know, and she was going to do another event at the Late Great Hell Gate Social—it doesn’t exist anymore—it was this great venue that we had on Astoria Boulevard, near Astoria Boulevard rather, and it was all about portraits of people in the neighborhood that she took, everyone in a wife-beater—just to make everyone homogenous, and, just see the quality and like the differences in their faces and like whatever they had been through in their life coming through, and she like wait, you write right? You’re a poet right? Why don’t you read. And I was like—uh—you know? And literally me saying yes to that, opened the flood gates, you know, and then after that I was just like I got the bee in my bonnet and like I wanted to understand like ok, where are other readings in Queens, where are other writers? What—is there a scene? Like are there reading series, and then that also, yeah was like a pivot off moment from you know doing shows with music and arts and everything jumbled together, really, like this is the banner that I really want to carry for this literary scene. And like I was freelancing at one point and then I was, you know, getting into the scene and discovering you know, at that point, there were like—I only found one, and then I found three reading series—in all of Queens. I’m like, this can’t be. We gotta connect the dots. And that was huge. That led to—and so I started with Liz, that was the beginning of 2011 and then—like now I’m like, oh my god its crazy to think how quickly things go after that. So, 2013 I did the first ever Queens Literary Town Hall at Queens Council on the Arts and I got all these myriad people together and like everyone who was not even just doing a reading series, but doing, you know, a writer’s group or whatever, and I was like, and the bookstores had just opened up again in the neighborhood after—oh my God, I think it was like Seabourn’s Books, wow I have not even accessed that memory in a long time—we didn’t have any bookstores for a second! You know, its like, what? You know, and suddenly we had Enigma Bookstore who opened up an Astoria Bookshop and I was like we need to get all these people, in one room, and like have them talk to each other, and have them—I met an amazing woman Wendy, who was doing things further out in Queens—and just like suddenly, you know, these threats came, were just showing up, and instead of wanting to compete with them, I was always like sticking my hand out, being like, let’s all work together, let’s like talk to each other, lets figure this out and I got on TV for it, which is crazy, I got on New York 1 that year. Khylla Watson: Wow. Oh my gosh, wow. What did that feel like? Audrey Dimola: Oh my God. Nuts! You know, to be like—and the thing that was even more nuts about it, was that I just, I tweeted to Rocco Vertuccio on New York 1, right, you never think? And literally, he was like send me info, tweeted back, you know, and then I sent him info and he was like come in on Thursday. That is literally it! You know, and that’s why I tell everyone, I’m like, do the thing that you do not know, right, like it seems like its nothing but you have no idea what could happen and later on I got to go back on New York 1 to talk about my own book, which was really crazy. Rocco had me on again, so it was like, super surreal. Khylla Watson: I can’t believe you said that in 2013, that was the first time that there was a bookstore around. Audrey Dimola: The first time there was a bookstore again. I don’t know if I’m messing up the name, Seabourn’s Books was there a really long time on Broadway and it closed, and then, you know, later on, there was a bookstore, there were some Barnes and Nobles around, or at least there was one on Austin Street, which also closed, which triggered other friends of mines to want to start the Queens Bookshop Initiative, which made a bookstore in Q Gardens. But, you know, like trying to look into it, Enigma Bookstore unfortunately was like a sci-fi themed bookstore and it didn’t last super long and we lost that one but Astoria Bookstore, you know, is surreal to imagine. This the only—especially because we don’t have this like big Barnes and Nobles store anymore—so there were things at some points but that store had closed. Khylla Watson: Well, ok. So, you said you were kind of doing a lot of things, you know, like branching out into the community, starting your own groups, bringing everyone together, so of course you spiraled down and landed at Socrates Sculpture Park, so what was that like? How did that start? Who did you meet? What was that experience like? Audrey Dimola: Que life explosion! Basically like the trajectory of my life was, you know, I started off at that arts magazine, when I got fired from that—the same day—the same day I got picked up by a blog about Long Island City, which was this great girl that I knew in the neighborhood, it was called LIQ City. So, those, like I felt like those were right on mission, like they say, right like these are things I want to be doing, right, I’m working in media, I’m working in the neighborhood. And after I lost that gig—que the kind of like spinning out into whatever random job comes across my table, right, as you do—you know, and like, so that’s when I became a project manager for a web and mobile development company, you know, and then all the other jobs I listed on that pre-interview survey from there going to be a dog-handler at a doggy day care, going, you know, working at a yoga studio. I even like worked for a family friends plastic surgery office—super weird, you know, like—I was a temp in the legal department of the Port of Authority, like totally, I was a babysitter. I was a bike messenger for Grubhub, right. But the saving grace for me through all of that was always doing this creative stuff on the side and that is what led me to Socrates eventually. Because even though I had this resume that looked coo-coo-loo-ku, I could say, like I self-published these books, you know, I’ve like made all these connections with these cultural institutions—like Queens Council On the Arts, like Queens Museum—suddenly, I found myself being asked by the Queens Poet Laureate to curate the local stage of his massive festival at the Queens Museum. Or like Queens Council On the Arts, you know, after we started our relationship, or solidified our relationship, rather because I knew them from previously when I worked as a journalist, you know, they were like we need poets, right, like and spoken word and music like for the block party, Audrey, you do it. You know, suddenly, like my name was out there, out there, swirling around and people were thinking of me and I was just like tenacious and insane and like anything. You know, I had either full-time jobs, or just like myriad jobs all over the place and just still like you have to have this drive, even if on the side, right, to like do the things that you love. And like more often than not I was free, you know, like I was happy when like I got a stipend or something, but it was not the caveat, you know. It was like, I didn’t do this, and I have all these amazing people that thankfully rally behind me also and like they also didn’t ask for pay. They were just like we just want to do this with you, you know. I also want to mention my friend Gus Rodriguez who is the booker at LIC Bar. He was the one, before the Queens Literary Town Hall, he gave me my first gig to host a show. He gave me a space. And so it’s like all these people in your life, open the door for you and crack, but you have to run through it, right, and take it. I can not stress enough, just like, how these small kindnesses of these people changed my life forever, you know, Liz and you know working with Justin, and working with Gus, to do my first show. So, yeah and then culminating with, getting to know, and just like saying yes to everything! I feel like, you know, you get to a point eventually where you can’t but when you’re first starting, like, say yes, you know, and just like meet all these people because you never know. And like, everything in my life sprouted in another way. You know, I started a relationship with this awesome woman at the Latimer House Museum and then suddenly me and my creative tribe get carte blanched to create a sight specific theatrical experience in the Latimer House Museum in Flushing. You know, just like, here’s the keys to a historic house, have fun, like what? And like, I had met someone who worked at Queens Council On the Arts when I was a journalist, his wife works at LaGuardia Preforming Arts Center—got in there to do my most massive show, ever, which then like killed me because I—it ran like, two and a half hours, or one. I want to say less to make it sound better but its totally true. Like, too long; it ran too long. But just like being able to experiment in all these ways eventually, you know this was later, doing a show all about the intersections of art and mental illness. You know, doing a show about like trauma that we carry in the body, it was called Church and Sacred Body, so like over time just pushing edges. And so I had, in 2015, I was a project manager again from a referral from my original job and I was living in Brooklyn, for that one year-ish, you know, and I was engaged, and then I called everything off. I quit the job, I left the guy and like crash landed back home in Queens and then was like, now its time to find myself. Now it’s the time to figure out how to love myself, right, and figure out what I really want to do. Because again, right, like all of these just like random, random, random jobs, you know, and like yeah taking whatever was coming across my plate. I was also like taking gigs, hosting open mic for In The Inspired Word—which is a great organization—so literally it was like towards the tail end—you know, it was just like this amazing summer that I just like ran around until y money was gone. I was training as a wilderness guide, mostly for free, in the Catskills. I was like living the dream. I was just like what is my heart saying to me? What do I want to do? And then, yeah crashing back in a super low point. No money, no real place of my own, and just like directionless, you know, and dealing with like mental health stuff. Like super bad depression, and my coming out of that, like making a decision to like dig out and again be like, ok, the next job I get has to be the job. I remember, like, I was crashing at my ex-boyfriend’s house, who was a God-sent and like let me stay there in my turmoil and I remember like sitting at the table and really thinking about it and I was like I want to work with parks, I want to work with kids, I want to work with art. You know, and I was like applying for like an urban farm job on Randle’s Island—I was applying to be like a playground associate, which sounds the most amazing job ever—with New York City Parks and you know, just like really trying to just change my trajectory because I didn’t want to be a journalist anymore I didn’t, you know, like—and all of these other interests had just like popped up organically over time and I did not realize until starting to work at public programs. That’s what it is! This whole time, right? And literally like my mom just told me by chance, she was like check Noguchi, check Socrates and I’m like no one’s ever hiring! No one’s ever hiring! And like, for whatever reason I checked anyway, and they had a job that I mistakenly thought was from the current year—it was from last year and I called up about it and I felt really embarrassed. And they were like but, you know, that job position is old but we are shaping that position for this year. So, I literally caught it before it was even out. And they were like send us your resume and I like stayed up all night and wrote this like gushy cover about like Socrates is my special place, ever since I was kid I feel like I’ve seen like every exhibition, you know like, and then being able to like point at all this insane journey that I’ve done, right, like, everything on the side, on the side, and literally I got the email, come in. Come Thursday, the director of poet programs wants to interview you. Like again, right, these like pivotal moments of you know like, I feel like Socrates chose me. Like it was just very strange because I worked under this woman who, again, like—I feel like I get emotional about these like pivotal people in my life that just like, you know, her name is Pasqualina Azzarello, and she made me feel like I had a place in an arts institution whereas before I had a chip on my shoulder, you know, and I was like, I don’t fit in anywhere. I’m like too loud, I too this, I’m too that, you know. I don’t have a museum background or I don’t you know, like—I didn’t go to arts school, you know like, I didn’t—I don’t have, I just like did all of this, boots on the ground, like from my gut, and that’s like all I have to say about it, right, like I don’t have a Master’s, like nothing, you know. And, we just like clicked in this cosmic way and it turned out, you know, we were together, running the public programs at Socrates. And it turned out a couple months in, that she was making a decision to leave Socrates very unexpectedly because of life changes in her life and she was like, I need you to think about your life, what your future looks like and what you want. And I was like, what’s happening?! You know, like meanwhile I’m thinking like I found a mentor, I’m going to like go to the season and like from her, and maybe someday I’ll be the director of public programs and suddenly she’s like, I’m going and if you want to throw your hat in the ring, tell me and I will tell the executive director. And me like, crisis of like I’m totally not ready, right like, some adult is going to come in and do this job because I was still like shirking, you know, my worth. And then I was like, I would be effing crazy to not at least try, so I tried, you know, and I got interviewed and they were interviewing other people who were older me, like, had education backgrounds because you know, were professors, had master’s degrees, whatever it was. You know, and like, I kind of like let it go because I didn’t like hear back and I was like ah well. And they freaking ended up choosing me! You know, and they were like, we’re willing to support you, like you have all these things that you can’t teach that are coming from your heart and your enthusiasm and you know, here we freaking go! And so, that’s what I mean, its been like—this process of coming into this directorship is just so much more than what I even imagined. Do you know, like the whole first year and like after I—so like towards the—like literally I got the job in April, Pasqualina and I overlapped in August, and I was alone by September. Khylla Watson: Of this year? Audrey Dimola: 2016. Yeah. Do the logistics for the fundraising gala. Do the last two festivals by yourself. And now do the budget for next year. You know what I mean and these are like large scale outdoor events with like thousands of people. Logistics, folks working under me and just like—you know I was so caught up in not screwing up and like proving that I had a right to be there that I wasn’t, yeah, this problem kid with a chip on her shoulder that somehow snuck in through the back door, to realize like I deserve to be here. And realizing that this job and this directorship is not just about checking off the boxes, making sure that the events happen, you know, everything happens, and execute, execute, execute, you know its what I’ve done. The first year was amazing, but also, like, really tough and in like every way, like I pushed myself. You know there were times we’d do a incredible festival and them I’m like crying on the floor of my office after because, I’m like—every bit of me was just like scraped out. I had no boundaries; I had no self-care protocol like, and just whatever was necessary to be for it, you know, and like coming around to. I also had like myriad crisis in my life. Relationships and mental health wise, you know, and just like going through all of that and like realizing who I am, and showing up for myself, has helped me this year to just like be so present and like convene with the energy of the park and the history of the park and that sacred space that’s there. My sacred space and like dig in with these employees that I have which are all like these amazing youth. With all different life experiences and we’ve all just had this insane transformational experience right, and I’m like, my God its not just about not screwing it up, you know, like, and you know Pasqualina told me, like her immortal words, she’s like no matter how much you try not to fall in a trap, you’re going to fall in the trap, like you will just not see it from a million miles away. Doesn’t matter, you know, how hard you’re trying or how careful you’re trying to be. You know, but like its not about falling in the trap it about how you get out of it, right? Like, take responsibility, like the grace with which you come out of it, you know and just yeah, owning it. And if its ugly, its ugly, because goddamn it, its usually ugly, you know. So really, like I’m growing up fully, like at Socrates into this position and its not just this job, its like what is teaching me in my own life, yeah, self-care wise, boundary wise, being healthy wise, showing up in life, trying to short circuit like a lot of really tough patterns in—a lot of tough self-defeating patterns that I’ve had pretty much had my whole life—so. Long, crazy, story, right? Khylla Watson: Yeah, but amazing at the same time. It’s just amazing. Do you feel like working there has kind of blurred the creative energy that you’ve felt for the past couple of years? You know, having all of these numbers, and all of these responsibilities. Do you feel like you can still juggle the creativity aspect of yourself how you did before? Or now do you feel that its kind of dwindling down because I know you wrote a book, Wildlight, this past year, so I just want to know how you were able or if you’re able to juggle creativity and work? Audrey Dimola: That’s an awesome, really awesome question. I, yeah, like really since the Ins and Outs days, I didn’t have a creative day job. Really. They’re all creative in their own way but like in terms of this kind of output like from yeah, your gut and your heart, like because programs is not just like you’re doing a thing; you’re holding space you know and there are times when I’m like dead after it you know because you’re holding the energy of all those souls. You know, you’re creating a safe space and also for my employees and like its not anything of what it just seems like on paper right, its like a huge energetic expense. I mean, yeah. So what I’m actually trying to do now—its funny that you ask—is like, you know Socrates is just a beast, like, you know and that has to be my priority, right, like I cannot let this thing get out of control. I have to be—like show up for my employees, for myself, for the park, for you know, all these events and like, I just blew myself out the first year. You know, I did like the most robust season Socrates had probably ever had, ever! And I like almost killed myself in the process, right, like everything happened, but like, I’m a shell of a person. So, Wildlight—so like what I was speaking of, of Wildlight, like what I’m realizing now, is how do I work with the seasonal nature of Socrates as it exists right now because my live season is May to October—April to October. That’s when we’re creating—especially in the summer we’re crazy—its just like not really realistic. At this point, maybe some years down the line I’ll feel more, you know, acclimated, and be able to do it but its too, yeah, it has absolutely been challenging. Because of course like, at the Port of Authority, I’m sitting at my desk like making like poetry stickers and like cutting them out because I finished my work already and nobody cares, you know what I mean? Sorry, Port of Authority. But, yeah, having things that you can just shut off or maybe are not as much of an energetic output, you know, this is like super challenging. To then come home and be like, alright, I’m going to work in my show now or I’m going to work on my book now, you know. So, I produce, in the off-season-ish time, is when I’m like performing a lot, you know and trying to curate and like pushing out Wildlight was like right at the edge of where the season was going to start and I was like if I don’t do this now, I’m going to get hit in a tidal wave. You know so then it was like every night I was staying up to two, three, four, like, and that was work from the past three years of editing it together so it wasn’t like sitting and writing a book, it’s like a culmination of poetry. So just like pushing it. Ugly, ugly, like, you know. Just like committing to this has to, you know, this has to happen because I had a previous due date of Fall 2017, missed it, you know, and so it’s like, woah, ok, y’know and I hadn’t missed, y’know I did two books previously and was able to like crank it out and I was like, this is really tough this time! You know, what is happening? Even like the content of the book was like super tough. So what I’m trying to do now and now that we’re like slipping into the off season—literally today was the first day that I like had some studio time to work on what I want to be like my next creative project because I felt really stifled in my own sphere because I’m like I can’t—I don’t want to do another book again, right, and I don’t want to perform my work. Like I want to make a one woman’s show that integrates like what I’ve been through and has movement and ritual and like ugliness and danger and beauty, and poetry and like in three dimensions and its terrifying because I have no idea of what I’m doing. I don’t have a map. But like that’s what you’re supposed to do right? Like, so realizing like ok Audrey, y’know, you are going to have to get up early and like rent studio time and do this or else its going to be an idea in your head because this show has been following me around for me a minute and giving me anxiety because it needs to come out. Y’know and feeling that itch again of like trying to discern my Socrates self and things that fit well and serve Socrates and my own stuff and where that those things can blur because of course like I’m curating these things, so it’s my heart and the way I hold space, but I’m not going to like do right, the same things at Socrates that I would do somewhere else. So, starting to—like I want to get back in that like tenacious mode, you know where I started. Where I was like emailing everybody, right, and just like wedging my foot in like every door and what could I cook up here? Like what thing can I do and try, and try, and try and I feel like you know, getting older and having been in the scene—quote on quote—in the neighborhood, its like you can get burned out and lose your edge and stay in the comfort zone. Y’know? Like now, going to a mic is like it’s easy, right, putting my poetry out there and speaking about all of this like vulnerable, crazy stuff, it’s easy, right, it’s like where am I terrified to go?! That’s where I have to go! And yeah, there’s like a girl I met recently, Shanice, and she started an open mic at this place called Flower Power, further out in Queens, and I’m like, seeing her, I’m seeing myself. I just see her tenacity and I’m like yeah. Remember that?! Y’know? And also like I’ve had just huge like transformational experiences on like the spiritual end, kind of in the ways, y’know, back at the beginning of this conversation we were talking about Emerson and Rumi and like that has changed you know how I can apply my art, it feels different; it feels alchemical. It feels like a prayer, it feels like energy, it feels like something’s happening. I’m not just like reading my work. It’s like oh, this makes ripples in the atmosphere. And so to realize this can work in different situations, like we can hold this reading like ceremony and I can apply to different things to read with a different mindset instead of just like I’m just going to read an open mic or I’m just like going to the show, there just like this layer that’s been peeled away and everything is merged. It’s like its all the same, like this alchemy, this transformation. So that’s been really exciting but challenging as hell yes. Great question. Khylla Watson: That’s amazing. I’m blown away. So, I don’t really want to—sorry to back track—but you were talking about your shows and, that’s what I wanted to get into next, but what was your first show like and what has it been like you know having more new shows? What is the transformation? What has the transformation looked like from your first show until now? And maybe to what you’d like to do. I know you were just talking about putting more energy and putting more affirmations into the universe. So, what is that like? Y’know, what’s going on with your shows? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, every question I’m like great question because they seriously are! They really are! Yeah, what I just mentioned actually is like the perfect segway of realizing like this is all the same, y’know, like I felt really drawn to like a shamanic path and the symbol and metaphor of the shaman of what they do, right, that they’re like leading you to what’s real in effect, right, to the other world, right, to bring back information. Khylla Watson: If I can interrupt, where did that come from? Audrey Dimola: Oh yeah, so—I feel like it could like go as far back as like Pocahontas in 4th grade and being really drawn to like Native American spirituality and like God and nature, and in the animals, and spirit. So, I was always an earthy, like, wild child kid from then. I grew up Catholic though, like we got baptized, ate communion, but you know it was—and my parents were both not devout, they just did it because they’re Italian and like y’know, you just gotta do it, you know? But like, none of my—like my brother or my sister didn’t make conformation, you know we didn’t continue—it wasn’t like baked into us. Thankfully, you know I inherited and through watching my mother’s like spiritual exploration, you know, we were young and she’s literally reading books about quantum physics, dead sea squirrels, you know, like the lost gospels of Jesus Christ, and just like the Kabbalah, and just like questioning, exploring and like. So always, there was this idea that you don’t need a medium; you don’t need a church, you don’t need a priest, you don’t need whatever. Like you can go right to the source, and so for me, finally, like my way back around even to my own faith—to like the mythology and imagery of my own faith—was through starting with this like shamanic path and being drawn to shamanism and that happened [57:24] through like literally just going to events. Like, I’m trying to—like was there even like a specific point where this started happening? Women Who Run With the Wolves. I’m literally looking at the altar that is taking up one half of my room. You know, suddenly realizing, ok, there’s something here and again, all these threads just like appearing. But experiencing it in actual life was what changed me, like there’s this organization called Golden Drum in Brooklyn and they do this amazing heart and mind festival and they bring all these cultures from different places and you know there were these like Mahika dancers and like they’re leading us to call in the four directions. And everyone’s doing it together, y’know and its in the same way that it could’ve happened in a church, right, and you’re like saying the things that you’re supposed to say. But it felt right. In a way that like other things did not, you know, and I was like there is something here and then just like going deeper into that, and like this idea of the Wild Woman, and wild spirituality, and the self and like just this hunger to experience other cultures’ myths and folklore and legends. And then going to, and having amazing friends also on the path who were doing this, and doing their own ceremonies and stuff like that; reading things so the more that I started walking to that—there’s also this organization called New York Shamanic Circle, where they do this amazing shamanic gathering in the great hill at Central Park and I remember going there and again these Mahika dancers were there and it was like Celtic shamans, Yoruban shamans, you know, like Italian shamans and I was like what?! Y’know so experiencing spirit in a living way and then realizing, oh my God, I’ve been doing this all along in ways I didn’t even realize. So like, I feel like the biggest thing that’s happened to me now is like merging all these selves, where there was like, ok, this person who feels like they’re on the shamanic path and then there’s this like this like worker person, and then there’s a poet person, right, but it’s like wait. And that’s what I think one of the biggest things I’ve learned since the beginning, from that first show, is like not having the same nervousness in the same way and like understanding—this amazing poet was like, the day you do not have nerves is the day you should quit. Because it means you don’t care about it anymore. And I tell it to everybody I can because it changed my perception, right? So, its like looking at everything as an opportunity now. Or its just like I’m not just doing a show, I’m not just hosting, not whatever. Like, we’re holding a container. How do I make these people feel safe? How do I get these people to push their edges? You know, and that is what my first show was. It was called Nature and the Muse, and it was reading and live writing, by the fire, in LIC Bar. So that opportunity from my friend Gus and I was y’know going to all these readings, volunteering and just like taking the pieces, right, this works, this doesn’t work, this works, this works, and I was like, crafting this thing, y’know of like—it’s four or five writers and they read their previously written works but then the twist of it is that I ask everyone in the audience to write something on a piece of paper, it can be like an actual writing prompt or it can just be like an image, or a word, or like a song title, whatever the hell they want—I don’t censor it—it can be perverse, I don’t mind. And so the writers read their regular work, this is the poems that I’ve written on my own time and then they pull some out of the hat, that the audience wrote, and they have to go downstairs in the dungeon—quote on quote—in the basement of LIC Bar and they have to write for like five to seven minutes, that’s it, and then they have to come up and share it. So its like terror all around, right, like and the audience has a reason to stay because they want to see if someone go their prompt, right, and it showed me how much I love being this like trickster spirit, because like I began to see oh my God look what happens when you like push people to like trust themselves. And everyone was always terrified, terrified to do the show, y’know, but like every time it was like hilarious or brilliant or like so surprising and for myself also, because I was super afraid to trust myself in that way. Ok, that’s a save having a mic and having a thing, you know, but to trust myself in an improvisational way which I hadn’t done since like playing party quirks in high school, you know like, and just improving like as a person, y’know and as I started doing all these things I just like—again speaking about the banner that I’m carrying, it’s like you realize that over time you get stripped of the things that you knew when you were a kid. Because you know everything when you’re a kid, right? You could be anything. You had no fear, you know like whatever you wanted to be you just were and you saw wonder in everything and you just learned and if you messed something up—and I was just like, this is ludicrous and like criminal that the world—well I don’t even want to say the world—that society, whatever, the structures that exist like beat it out of us. So that is like my banner and my work. How do I get the sense of play? How do I like, experiment with people? How do I get them to trust themselves? You know, and so many like blessed moments of like either shepherding this person to read for the first time or shepherding this person to stand up and speak about this trauma or like whatever it is that I can like help do [1:03.26] you know and its like going back to Rainer Maria Rilker, with like Letters to a Young Poet. One of the things that he was writing is like he’s giving advice to this young poet and he’s like, don’t think for a second—I’m like grossly paraphrasing—but like, don’t think for a second that like I’m able to tell you this because I’m totally fine, I’m not. And I went through all these things so that I can, y’know, and so like, I would always be like if it appears to you that I’m holding the keys, just open your hands, you have them too. So, that’s been the big thing and like I was saying to you just realizing like when I get comfortable, I have to move and its really hard to move sometimes. Usually I’m really good at being transformer, and like understanding that and going after it but then like getting to this point where like there’s a lot of stuff with moving in the body and like that’s related to like my life and to trauma and like reclaiming myself, right, so like to be a performer in three dimensions fully and like trust yourself with that, has like all these other layers that like getting a mic and reading my work and I can hear in my voice just like the clarity in it, like the power in it. Like as opposed to when I first started and not saying obviously, I don’t screw and f’ things up, but I realize y’know like, things that I do don’t follow the norm. That’s why my shows run long and I beat myself up for it like to no end and I was like God, I’m like such—I’m so unqualified to do this, blah blah, you know, but its like I’m doing more than that; I’m on shaman time and I realize that like recently like when the shaman is healing, you know, and like I’ve met these amazing medicinal men from Mexico and they were like however long the healing lasts, that’s how long it lasts. Whether its eight hours or five minutes, right. And its like, if I’m holding this container like at Queens Council On the Arts, when we did that mental health show, it was a container like I had never experienced. And the show ran, yeah, hours too long. Thank God, Milando Jones, another amazing person, he stuck with us, but I was like watching this and participating and feeling and there’s no way I’m going to be like time to go! You know, like is more than just a show, this is more—so that’s where I feel like all of this has gone and even at Socrates too like the more that I can own who I am and feel clear in expressing that, right, like and I like slipped in some shamanism like on stage at Socrates and just like however you can channel your true self, like it makes all the difference and I hear that from people like in Socrates, y’know, attendees to the shows commenting about me or about my staff you know like, what you put into that is so real. So yeah. Khylla Watson: Has anyone ever been inspired, like you know, came up to you like wow that really moved me? What was that like? What kind of experience was that? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, oh my God, I mean those are the most humbling experiences and it can be with anything, you know especially like with my own work and that’s when I realize, right—going back to Emerson now—his quote, trust thyself, every heart vibrates to that iron string, right. The more personal you get, the more it reaches people. And like literally I have put like things that I thought I would never say, right, that I would never share, like its all out there and that’s also how I’ve also kind of made a name for myself, which also has made people very uncomfortable and it feels dangerous, right, and then it’s like you take that with it because its more important to me to be myself and like, life is ugly man! Like, no, really, this stuff happens! And like I really feel like the places I’ve been enable me to do this work and help people and its like then I have to accept that you know, why do we go through these awful things? To like, bottle them up and pretend they didn’t happen? Y’know? That’s like the transformative experience and I remember like I did a performance that was edging out into this space, its called Reliquary the Body, and like the first line of it was: I was studying for midterm exams in my freshman year of college when I found out I was pregnant. Like, just like, here we go. Tracing this like origin story of this like trauma of my body and my decisions and my relationships, and I was like terror, like terror; like everything in me was like you’re going to mess this up, you’re going to forget the words, like so much just awful energy in my body but like somehow I did it and I like cried afterwards and I came out and like all of these people were like, I was crying, I was this, and it reminded me of myself and its like woah, wow. So its like how can I not—I feel like when you get that affirmation, and I always have—right, the more vulnerable I am, the more I put myself out there, the more I like, yeah, and like walking on this path of truth in myself, the more I’m affirmed. So how can I go back? Even if people have told me, you can’t possibly say that. What about your reputation? What are people going to think of you? You’re a director. You can’t, like, have potential mental illness. You know, I’m like that’s real life! And that’s what’s been so transformative for me with working with these youth at Socrates, like, I’m like oh my God I have a chance now to be the boss that I want to have, right, that I like wish I could’ve had and literally we put that out there from like that first meeting. Like self-care is number one, like if you’re having a mental health crisis, tell me. If you’re feeling anxious and like you don’t want to come to work, or like you need a moment during the festival, like—to make that make space and literally like—these kids changed my life, like these kids changed the way I think about everything. I’m calling them kids but they’re like eighteen/nineteen. To see what happens when you like take a risk, you know, and I share these like really intimate stories with them about my own life and like it has bonded us, together in a way that they’re like, shouldn’t do that. I’m saying they, whoever they is, y’know. Like don’t let your employees know so much about you—don’t break the fourth wall, like they’re your employees not your tribe, they gotta know who is in charge, you know, and I’m like—I never resonated with that. And now to like be in a space where I’m like look how like these kids are all willing to like and breath the Socrates spirit and like you know they have come in when they’re sick. You know what I mean? Like they’re invested not to the place but to each other. And that’s what I feel like I’m here to do, you know, when I get out of my own way and remind other people, like, you can get out of your own way too and to learn from people have gotten out of their own way. Khylla Watson: Wow. You really have a way of bringing people together, its very apparent. So, well of course, I mean you, your life, and experience have inspired your work, but is there anything else that inspires you? Maybe it is something that is daily, maybe its gratitude? Is there something specific or multiple things that inspire you? Audrey Dimola: Yeah, it’s that like sense of living spirit, now. Of like realizing that everything at any moment is talking to you. Like there is metaphor, and imagery, and symbolism and its meaning is everywhere and you can choose to not see it and think that like someone else needs to take you there or that you cant get there or like, right, whatever story it is. Or you can like start like putting your feet on the ground and like feeling what’s actually here and not saying that that’s always beautiful either but its like to have an authentic experience of life, you know, and like it actually ties into Socrates, Mark Di Suvero, the founder of Socrates, who is one of my heroes—a living legend—you know everyone is like why the hell is the park named Socrates, right, why is it named after a philosopher, and Mark, actually just at our fundraiser gala, he was like, Socrates lived a search for truth. That’s what this place is about, y’know and Mark quoted Socrates as saying wisdom begins with wonder. And I think wonder is everything. Like, Borges was also like without enchantment everything is useless. Like you need to be able to see through that and break the fourth wall and like whatever it is that’s like telling you that life is just ho-hum and you gotta go to work and you gotta do this, and you gotta fall in line—y’know like I’ve never—I’ve always like resisted so hard against that in ways that also spited myself, right, like I damaged my jobs, I damaged relationships because I was so gung-ho on like exploding every limit. Like I had peter pan syndrome for a long time, didn’t want to grow up, you know, and like just subverted a lot of that and now I feel like what growing up is, is like keeping that childlike spirit but with the wisdom of being an adult and you’re not coming from a petulant place, you’re coming from like a wiser place and you know you can do the same thing, but your not—literally my therapist told me this—she was like how much more powerful can you be as an adult who can make change rather than a child screaming to the wind, right? Why are you choosing that? Choose to be real, choose to get old and die and like make an impact in this finite amount of time that you have. So yeah, I feel like in my most filled up living moments is like feeling all of that, feeling spirit, feeling everything talk to me, feeling, you know, yeah, like I was saying God and nature. Feeling all these things that like I read about and seemed so mystical to me, now I’m like that’s what you mean. I understand, y’know. And it’s there for everybody. The other thing that inspires me is self-care and self-love because it was just so absent on my journey and like small things, like I’m going to go home and make dinner for myself and go to sleep early, you know what I mean, like small things—I’m going to make this altar in my room and I’m gonna like, you know, take a bath, and I’m gonna—I started getting into sensory deprivation floating, if you’re interested in that at all, I could hook you up—doing that, and like eating well, and just like, that has been a huge source of wonder. Like, oh my God, I really like can be in control. And growing up does not have to suck. Khylla Watson: Wow! You’re just amazing! Audrey Dimola: I love you girl, we’re going to be friends after this video. You hear that whoever. Khylla Watson: *Laughs* I think we kind of covered everything that I was going to ask you. You did great. So I guess, to go into wrapping this up, where do you see yourself in the next couple of years or do you have any predictions? Audrey Dimola: Scary question! Ha! Whenever someone asks me that I like clam up. But I feel like, you know, its so funny because for the majority of my life I was like I’m going to live and die in Queens and I don’t want to live anywhere else. You know, and like, I know that I’ll always have my roots here, my home here, but like I think at some point I’d love to experiment living somewhere else. I recently, I was like a reclamation journey and to finish Wildlight, I took a Greyhound to the desert by myself, to Santa Fe, and I had like this spiritual pilgrimage and like fell in love with that place. You know, and I—feel like I didn’t get to have that time where I—yeah, it could be like I’m going to make the decision to live here for like a month, or like just be an artist inhabiting that, and doing a residency or something like that. So that’s like, in the ether but I feel like right now, like my life is so Socrates and like this like transformative insane experience that it’s been, and growing with it, and growing into it, and just like being there and just balancing the rest of my life, creating this healthier life for myself with different patterns, or like not patterns, actually—taking the patterns away—and like continuing to move into these spaces of daring and how do I continue merging all these things that I am with movement, with ceremony, with doing the things that terrify me, y’know. [1:17:24] Yeah because at the end of the day I think with everything right I’m a servant of the people, like that’s what I always say. Like, whether its at Socrates and we’re like doing like summer solstice or we’re doing jazz night, you know, or it’s like, helping someone one on one, or like curating our smaller show that can be more experimental, it’s like that’s what I want to do and I do feel like the heroes journey, like Joseph Campbell was saying, and you know like these shamanic paths that like the shaman goes into the other world or into the underworld, y’know, the hero descends to bring—and goes through these traumas to bring back this information. And I’ve been through so much, especially in the past three years since I left that engagement, some like incredible things and so many dreams lived and so many like awful things that I like didn’t think I would survive, frankly, y’know. And so like, how do I continue using that and how do I continue helping other people to share their stories too? Because that’s what we have to do, that’s what we have to do. Right, its like, we are meaning makers, and that’s why I have tattooed on my arm: live your legend, which also like grew out of Joseph Campbell, y’know of like, this is whatever the hell we want it to be. This can be ho-hum do-drums, life sucks, and then you die, or it can be like, I’m going to perceive like spirit in everything! And I have spirit guides, and I have like mythological creatures, you know what I mean, and I’m going to like to create this world because why the hell shouldn’t I? I’m here. Khylla Watson: Yes, yes. I completely understand. Believe me. Well, what about—because you said that Queens has always been your home and being as though you said you want to get into a space where you’ll be able to move on, you know, start a different life or just have the strength and courage to live the true life of an artist—do you see yourself breaking away from this? Audrey Dimola: That’s what I don’t know. [1:19:45] And like I’ve always been so bad with like, where do you see yourself in five years, I’m like I have no idea because literally my life changes every day, every hour. That’s like bipolarity, but also like real life, y’know. So like, I love Queens because this is my place, you know? This is my roots like, and this place I felt like has needed so much cultivation of like—we have culture here, we have art here, we have music here, we have writers here, you know, like, and to really—yeah, again, I’m going to say banner, because of the banner like ten thousand times, y’know of like getting us on the map, getting us recognized, whatever it is. Khylla Watson: Do you feel you’ve planted a seed in Queens, in this community? Audrey Dimola: I feel like I do. I hope so, like I hope so, but I feel like I do. Like yeah, you know because its like now I look at that literary scene and there’s so much and like I had just mentioned, you know, that girl Shanice that I just met, and like people are starting things. You know, I was like I need to do a literary town hall again, y’know there’s so much now. And I feel like, yeah, with the gentrification, you know the good thing is that there are a lot of people moving in—if the people who are moving in want to dig in to their community that’s amazing. I don’t mind it, of course it like really sucks, like losing the beautiful houses and also straight up and down it sucks not being able to live here, right—affordable housing, right—but like, I can never say I don’t want new people to move in here, y’know, and I’ve watched countless people just fall in love with Astoria. In ways they don’t fall—like, these are actors, dancers, folks from like elsewhere in the United States or the Midwest whatever and you’re just like, this feels like home. Like, that’s so special. Y’know, and to—so I feel like if I went anywhere else it would probably just further prove like how special this place is. You know, like, there’s a magic here and like I do at Socrates right, it’s my responsibility to uphold that y’know as the neighborhood is changing. This has to be the meeting place of the people, right, like we’re surrounded by the projects, we’re surrounded by condos coming up, y’know, and then we have folks like me who have lived here our whole life. How do you maintain the space that accommodates all? You know? Because like Socrates also had really—that’s a whole ‘nother conversation—that had such like rowdy roots and organic roots started by the people for the people and eventually got designated a city park and then over these years become more professional and institutionalized. But as it becomes that, yeah, how do you ensure like the fabric of the people and that neighborhood—and that’s what I’m like really proud of. To stand on my stage and look out at the audience and see the rainbow, right? Khylla Watson: Right. And its just so amazing how when you were talking about how the definition of, you know, what the park means and what Socrates means, how your life kind of reflects and mirrors that. I don’t know if that was a question but ok, so for the last thing—this is just like a bonus thing, because I know that you’re a poet and writer, so I was just curious, you know I wanted to hear you recite a poem or anything you can think of that you wrote about yourself, Queens, your life. Anything that you want. So if you listen back to this maybe years down the line you’ll hear it or it’ll remind you something. It could be an answer for you. Audrey Dimola: Wow. Ok! Okay, that’s really cool. I’ll already do something from Wildlight, definitely. Yeah. I immediately like jumped to this. So this is a piece towards the end of my third book Wildlight and it came out—a wonderful friend of mine, Yugo Kudo, was doing a show on freedom, and it was like, days to the new year and I had, yeah, just been through so much stuff and actually didn’t realize what I was going to go through in that next week and subsequent months, so like, I was just thinking of the idea of freedom because like—we were kind of dancing around when we were talking—that’s an idea that has chased me around everywhere, right, it has been what made me leave relationships, quit jobs, right, like, break boundaries, y’know, break myself. This idea of staying free, staying free. What the hell, like, what does that mean? And literally I was like standing in my bathroom and I like wrote this on a piece of paper on my toilet seat and like it just came out and I’m like reading this at the show. So: Freedom is one of the divine’s broadest and farthest reaching gesticulations in our universe. It is an energy that once you tap into makes anything possible. I personally have time after time have fallen prey to the idea that once you identify and claim the precious and wild idea of freedom, bang, its done, you get it and you’re free. Forever. Does it totally work that way? The beautiful thing about freedom is that it finds you. This is not about being positive free and triumphant forever from the moment you claim it to the rest of your life. Its about the reality that nothing is linear and solvable in that way. Freedom is really about honesty with yourself for where you actually are and that’s why freedom is so powerful. It can find you in the darkness, at the end of your rope, inside a jail cell, in recovery, with a knife in your hand, on top of a bridge, in therapy, laying next to you in your own grave. Its not about being consumed with shame and fear and loathing for ending up there, for not staying free. Its about meeting yourself where you actually are and realizing that true freedom is the voice that whispers to you: get up, don’t jump, stay a while, love yourself. And focusing your gratitude and energy on that regenerative spirit is what will really keep you free. I believe we are all messengers, shamans, teachers, healers. The freedom in being yourself, being honest with yourself, is a direct conduit to the divine; the soul of the universe. I say to the light workers, the light bringers—which we all are—don’t get caught up in only bringing light in the shame and disillusionment when you don’t or can’t. The world needs your warrior songs, your songs of struggle, your trials by fire too. That is your real duty. Stand as you are. Speak as you are. And bring it to the world. ",

  "Duffy_Jane_timecode.txt": "Jane Duffy is an Irish-American who despite being born in Manhattan, came to the country at the age of seventeen. She spent her early years doing housework and then waitressing to send back to her family in Ireland. She discusses her childhood in Ireland, living on a farm during the war. After getting married, she moves to Sunnyside and then Woodside. 00:00:25 Jane first came to New York in April of 1948, at the age of seventeen, in a boat called �The America.� She travelled alone and on the trip over, she felt very sea sick. Her aunt lived in Newark, New Jersey where she lived for two months. 00:01:40 Her uncle worked for Prudential Insurance, he could�ve gotten her a job for $29 a week. But Jane was not here for herself, she was here for her family. She was the oldest of five children and with no work in Ireland; they thought she would be better off doing housework. This way she can get room and board and also send money to Ireland and put money in the bank. 00:02:30 Jane went to Mrs. Wagner�s Agency on 59th Street and Madison Avenue, that�s where they hired you when the jobs came in. She got hired by a woman in Glen Cove, Long Island who paid her a $110 a month for the summer. She worked seven days a week, with a half day on Thursday where she would go to the beach with other Irish-Americans her age. 00:03:55 She then went back to the Agency and got a waitressing job in Riverdale for Jewish people. Jane also had family in Philadelphia with whom she stayed with, but �there wasn�t much life in it�. She loved the buzz in Grand Central and Penn Station and knew that�s where she belonged. 00:04:55 Jane was born in Manhattan and raised in Ireland. Her parents went back when she was two years old. The only jobs available in Ireland for a seventeen year old were working at the shop but you had to pay them to teach you for three years and pay for your own living expenses. 00:05:35 Jane�s sister was an investment banker and didn�t understand why she didn�t just go to school and get a good job rather than being a waitress. 00:06:00 The next summer she went to Lake Placid. Jane had a lot of friends who were doing the same type of jobs at her so wherever she saw a better opportunity with better pay, off she went. When her kids would complain about moving too much, she would reply, �When I was your age I slept in almost twenty different beds.� 00:06:26 Mrs. Wheeler was her boss and she had a brother named Mr. Rose, who had a big farm up in Poughkeepsie. That�s when she decided that she wasn�t going to do this anymore and got a job as a waitress at Schrafft's. Jane was then suggested to work at Stouffer�s instead, where she ended up working for thirty/forty years. It took six weeks of training, two hours every afternoon. At this time, she lived in East 81st street with a friend of her mothers. 00:08:30 In 1950, Jane�s father joined her. She used to do some catering in the evenings for private dinner parties. The second year she was there, a dance hall by the name of �The Caravan� opened up. On 59th and Madison there was a big clock, so if you had a date, you would meet them under there. Jane loved to dance, she rather dance than eat in those days. People were coming in the boat loads and it was great way to meet new people. 00:10:00 Jane had a friend who met a guy that said he worked at a bank. He was in engineering, she thought she had hit the jackpot but turns out he was just running the elevator up and down. He called himself a vertical engineer. 00:10:25 When Jane got married, she got an apartment in Sunnyside through building managers that her husband knew as a construction worker on 41-49 45 street. Everyone in that building was from Ireland. 00:11:09 Jane knew who her husband was before she even left Ireland. She knew he was a mechanic and he always seemed to have a car which was a big deal at that time. Jane had a bike and during the time of the war you couldn�t get a rubber tire. When she came back to Ireland for vacation, she met him at confession in Kerry. St. Stephen�s night (Boxing Day) is a big night in Ireland for dancing where he asked Jane to accompany him and a few friends. �Kevin Wood�s Band� was playing and the drummer of that band wanted to take Jane home three weeks before that but she wouldn�t even dance with the man because he was from out of town and she didn�t like long distance. 00:12:45 Jane had no intention of getting married, never wanted a steady boyfriend, but when she started hanging out with Patrick, one thing led to another. He was a great dancer and if you couldn�t, Jane would never agree to a second date. �When poverty came in the window, dancing went out the door.� Her husband was also a musician who played the flute then later the saxophone. (Patrick Duffy and his Showband) 00:13:44 Jane had five children. Her oldest son works for the Supreme Court downtown as a clerk. The other boy just retired, he was a Lieutenant in the Police Department. Her daughter, Bernadette, is a nurse. Her other daughter, Monica just retired from IBM after thirty three years. And Joan works for Columbian Presbyterian hospital in the transplant unit. All of them married except for Monica. Jane has thirteen grandchildren. 00:30:05 Had a horse training come in to do some exercises. Would get people asking about work with the horses. 00:14:53 Jane grew up on a farm in Ireland. They worked very hard and worked on the land depending on which season it was. Then at night you came home to do your homework but depending on if you had light. It was war time so if you didn�t get Paraffin oil for your lamps, you didn�t have light after dark. So she would do her homework in front of the fire, since she had a lot of homework. 00:15:46 Jane learned the Irish language in school. She studied it for six years in grammar school and then went to the Convent in Charlestown, where she learned Latin, French, Gaelic and English taught by nuns. 00:16:20 Jane is the oldest of five. They all eventually came to this country. Her one brother, Billy, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was in the Mental Hospital for thirty five years. Her sister was an investment banker who worked for MacKay Shields. Joe was a bricklayer when he was sober; unfortunately he died of drinking at fifty-three. Her other brother, Frank, worked on the Lincoln Tunnel when he died at fifty-one due to an enlarged heart. Only she and her sister are alive and both live in New York. 00:18:40 In Ireland, they worked in Meitheal; you worked together and helped each other out. 00:20:00 When Jane first arrived to New York she couldn�t understand how everyone knew where they were going except for her. She had to constantly read signs and directions. She came to Sunnyside when she got married, a ground floor apartment on 45th street. Jane bought a two family house in Woodside after having two kids and pregnant with the third. She lived in one and rented the other, living rent free for forty years. At that time Woodside was mainly Irish, Italians and Germans. 00:22:43 Saint Sebastian School was a big draw back in those days to move to Woodside. It was nearby so Jane didn�t have to drive since she didn�t have an American license. Back in Ireland, she purchased a license for a pound which would be equivalent to today�s $1.30, without a test or exam. 00:23:14 Jane and her husband were always involved in the Parish. She belonged to the Sliva and then eventually joined the county Mayo Association. Patrick bought a bar, though Jane hardly ever went into it because she didn�t drink. 00:24:48 The longer Jane has been in America, the more thankful she is. In the beginning, being away from your family was difficult. Those who�ve been in America and go back to Ireland are called �Returned Yank.� Her father�s first cousin married an Indian, Mable, who came to visit when she was in Ireland. She didn�t know what to expect and realized she was just a normal girl. 00:25:52 Back in those day in Ireland, you didn�t have TV, radio, electricity but you had each other. Elders had stories to tell and you would listen around the fire. Jane lived beside the Principal of the school, who was extremely nice to her. 00:26:48 Jane�s father was involved in the IRA and was on the run from 1921-1922. The English tied him and his companions behind a truck and dragged them along the road. They were taken to Galway Jail for two years with just bread and water. They escaped from the jail and got a boat through Galway Bay and went to Canada. 00:28:22 Her father worked on the Holland Tunnel. Her family went back to Ireland in 1932; they were only supposed to go for a month and ended up being there for years. According to her father, they were in Ireland for �nineteen years and nine days and nineteen years too long.� The second time around he was in the US for six years when he died suddenly on the 7 Train. He was with Jane�s two brothers, her mother and three friends. 00:29:40 Jane had extremely happy days with her family in Woodside, without the killings and robberies that you have now a days. When she had her first heart attack, five years ago, she was ready to go. Leaving Ireland when she did was the best decision she ever made. ",
  "Duro_Rick_timecode.txt": "“They are loyal—as long as there’s food involved.” Rick Duro’s mom was allergic to dogs, and while she allowed him to keep snapping turtles, pythons and piranhas, a canine was out of the question. When Rick moved to Sunnyside in 2003, he quickly compensated for those dog-less years by adopting Matilda, an adorable German Shepherd-Corgy-Chow mixture who, according to Rick, knows the words “car,” “Poconos” and her best friend’s name, “Pinto.” Crazy about Matilda and anything dog-related, Rick became a member of the Sunnyside United Dog Society (or SUDS) and eventually its president. Dedicated to the well-being of dogs, SUDS began quietly in Lou Lodati Park after September 11th, as dog owners yearned for a heightened sense of community and comfort. For the past nine years, SUDS, which encompasses plumbers, teachers, orchestra conductors, architects and cab drivers—“a really nice snapshot of the city, people of all creeds and colors,” says Rick—has gathered each night at a designated area at the park to let its dogs off the leash. (SUDS’s core group of 20 was instrumental in making the Off-leash Hours policy, which has allowed people to let their dogs run freely in public parks before 9 AM and after 9 PM, an official NYC Parks Department regulation in 2007.) Rick thinks that his group has long earned its exclusive area within the park on Skillman Avenue. Over the years SUDS has tried to clean up and keep the park safe at night. “The 108th precinct and the parks department appreciate that we are here,” Rick says. “You are not going to do anything in a park where there’s 20 adults and their dogs running around.” To the delight of SUDS, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer announced in a recent press release that he has secured funding for an official dog run inside Lou Lodati Park. SUDS’s activities extend far beyond the park’s borders. Once or twice a year the group organizes “Pick-up the Poop Day,” and its members have raised funds for sick dogs and taught children who stop by the park how to properly take care of the animals. “Sometimes the park becomes an impromptu classroom,” says Rick, who hopes to soon offer classes on dog behavior and training for kids. Perhaps most importantly, SUDS—and Matilda, of course—have helped Rick to make friends and relax after spending his day teaching global history to antsy high school students. “It’s a nice way to wind down your day,” he says. Dogs are soothing and comforting, and it’s fun to watch them interact. They are loyal—as long as there’s food involved.” ",

  "Eid_Mustafa-SabahGuessar_timecode.txt": "Mustafa Eid (ME): My name is Mustafa Eid. I manage Trade Fair supermarket on 30th Avenue. I�ve been at this location for two years and it�s been wonderful so far. It�s a safe area, very diverse. You can always find anything you want. In this store, other stores�no matter where you�re from you can always find what you want. You can we probably have food from six or seven Middle Eastern countries, Brazil, Portugal, India, Pakistan, oh probably a good 12 countries from Latin America�all around actually. I know where every single item is. Prior I worked for the same company but we have another branch on Ditmars. It�s very similar to 30th Avenue but not as exciting actually. Over here is more diverse, much more diverse. I live in Upper Ditmars. The quieter version. It�s actually been a journey. I was a college dropout. Yes, here in the United States. I was born upstate but I was raised in Queens. Right here in upper Ditmars. I�ve been in the same house since I was six months old. We moved from Syracuse when I was six months and I�ve been in the same neighborhood. I probably know the majority of Astoria already. I can�t move anywhere else! Nowhere else, no. It was inherited. My father he worked in the supermarket business, same company, since it opened. And after I left school he talked to the boss and said listen my son needs a job. I grew from the smallest position you can get, then I learned everything, and we�re doing a fine job here. Oh [in a normal day] I do everything from ordering the products to receiving the products to pricing the products. Managing the store is hectic you know. Hours are open, I don�t even have a schedule. Whenever I get the chance to stay here I stay here, no matter how long it takes. I can be here between nine to 16 hours. It�s busy till, around 2am. Sabah Guessar [SG]: It�s busy and safe. Three o�clock I am here sometimes and it�s very like I�m feeling home. I�m not feeling afraid. It�s a nice area. ME: It�s the diversity. Everybody knows the other person�s culture now. You respect everybody, everybody respects you, you go on with your life and that�s it. It�s not like it�s black or white. SG: No, no, no. It�s international. It�s not racist or nothing. Everyone feels together. Immigrants. The only one thing we feel like all immigrants. We try to be together. Culture, religions, it doesn�t make no difference. Colors, countries, languages. We try to speak each other�s languages. We try five languages speaking: French, English, Spanish, Arabic, dialects. ME: Even as managers here, we taught ourselves Spanish, we taught ourselves French. Portuguese. The products we know all of them. They�re surprised we actually know the name! SG: because when you come here you miss your country, you miss your stuff from your country, you just come to Trade Fair and �let me just come to the store which has international stuff and I will find my item.� ME: We are the bridge between the East and the West. We bring the food from the Eastern side of the World to the West. SG: I am Moroccan. ME: My family is originally Palestinian. But in this area, you don�t even ask where people are from any more. Diversity brings people together, it does. SG: You don�t look for like colors or religion or country. You look for the person who comes here to look for his products, to feel like he�s in his own town. Like when you come to the supermarket like you are travelling. So like you meet all the world. ME: You can cross borders when you cross our aisles. Like three to eight is the busiest time of day. SG: yes, like 12-8, this is the rush hour. When people are doing the big shopping. ME: We memorize all of our customers. SG: So if you don�t see them yesterday we say �oh we didn�t see you yesterday, what happened?� Or like if a customer disappears for 2-3 days it�s like �what happened we didn�t see you for a while�. ME: When I worked behind the deli counter I knew all the orders. I just had to see a person�s face I know their order. That�s when I worked behind the deli counter. We have to have a good memory with this kind of establishment. We treat every customer in a specific way. We make them feel like they are at home. SG: Like so when someone comes to ask for their product we have to make them feel comfortable to come again. ME: We�ll walk them to the product. Staff�between 110-120. [most challenging part of job] is making sure that every single product that a customer asks for is on the shelf. [If someone requests something] I look up in my book, I try to find it and I get it for them. That�s the number, number one thing we do. We are known for our variety and we want to stay known for it. Trade Fair is only in Queens. Nine locations only in Queens. There are three in Astoria, one in Jamaica, two in Jackson Heights, and one in Long Island City. It�s family-oriented. It started off as a mom and pop shop. It was only 400 square feet. This was the first location, this was Trade Fair number one. It started in 1974. The first location was here, it was probably the size of this grocery store right here. No, I wasn�t even born yet. My father started off in this store, and that�s how he knows the owners so close, and he got me in here. We�re getting by that�s all we�re asking for. I have a baby picture in �87 of when I was in this place. I�m 25 now. Oh I had to work hard for it. I started off at minimum wage. And I built myself all the way up until I got this position. With trust and hard work. Hopefully [in the future] I can get Vice-president of the company. I can�t be the President � because the President�s the owner � but maybe I�d get Vice! Hopefully I can get Vice Presdient that�s all I�m asking for. Hopefully! [Re family-run businesses]. People would prefer to go to a mom and pop shop to support you know a family-owned business rather than a franchise. Because franchise is always going to go back to corporate and what-not. It�s always good to support a place that started off from nothing. And that�s serving the public for so long. You know that it�s always going to be here for you. The boss started off like one of these customers. He came into the store as a customer and found out it was for sale and he took it. [The people who work here come] from all over, from all five boroughs. Some even come from Long Island and upstate and they commute every day. Anybody comes and asks for a job, we ask them to fill in an application, that�s all. There�s online hiring�newspapers�and we advertise in the Spanish paper, the Arabic paper, the Indian paper. We have a diverse crew here also. Very diverse crew. So any language that a customer walks in we will have at least one worker who speaks that language. We have to make sure that they are completely satisfied. Yes some employees have been here a long time. We trust them but we still have to watch them. People are always going to slack no matter what. We have to have someone on top of their head. ",
  "Ellis_Jon-GeorginaYoung_timecode.txt": "Jonathan Ellis (JE): I live on Welling Court, which is at the intersection of 30th Avenue and 12th Street Georgina Young Ellis GYE): I�m John�s wife. I live in the same place! We�ve lived there for ten years. JE: We moved here from New Mexico and we lived on 12th Street for three years. And spent the last year and a half of our time there we were looking for a house to buy. We insisted on it being in Astoria. We looked at tons of places. We saw this one, and we knew it was within our budget, and we knew it had some potential. We were the first people to see it. We made an offer and bought it. GYE: At that time, Welling Court, which was a street that really very few people knew about, until we did the mural project, it was a bad street. There were a lot of good people on it, who are still there now. But there were also crack houses. One was right next door to us. And we just kind of kept being persistent about calling the police when that was going on. Eventually, we and our neighbors made it into this really family neighborhood. Without gentrifying, without throwing anyone out except crack-heads! And prostitutes. We and others kind of pioneered the neighborhood. Without at all wanting to really change it. Because, well, some people refer to it as little Mexico. JE: Yes, the police refer to it as that. GYE: There are a lot of Mexican neighbors. We really value that. Being from the South west and having come here from New Mexico, we felt really at home. I love the community. And that might sound clich� or trite, but I really do. I love the flavor of it. And I love that it�s so many families and that there are tons of kids. And as soon as the weather gets warm the street is just like filled with kids. Because it�s not one of these really heavily travelled streets so they�re out there playing soccer all the time. And it�s warm. It�s just a warm community. And now we have the community garden right around the corner [Two Coves Community Garden]. Which just adds to it. That started three years ago. We�re members of it. JE: Right now Georgina and I are both working to get our feature-length screenplay produced. And we�re making some progress there. And I just published my book on weight control about a month ago. And Georgina just published her novel. GYE: They�re both e-books. Jon�s is a paperback as well and an e-book and mine�s just an e-book. So we�re writers. And Jon is also a web-designer. And a film-maker. And I am also a teacher. I teach English as a second language. And I�m an actress. We�re artists, essentially! JE: I�d been looking at gang-tagging getting worse and worse and worse. In the neighborhood and all around the neighborhood. Well, I�ve always really kind of admired graffiti in all kinds of ways. When it was nice! Of course Banksy is a big influence in the world right now. And I saw a piece of programming on CBS Sunday mornings that was about an event in Paris that is done every year where graffiti artists from all over the world converge and do their works. So I got that in my head, that there was no reason why we couldn�t somehow manage to pull that off on Welling Court. So I spent two years I guess trying to get somebody to play the game with us. I used to find people working on the street and just stop them and say, �I have this project in mind and I�m looking for people to do it with me.� Strangely it was difficult to make that connection. And then a friend of ours said �I know these people and I�ll connect you to them.� They�re a group called Ad Hoc arts. Ad Hoc connected us to essentially forty artists. They invited them into the neighborhood. GYE: From all over the world. Some of them are really world-renowned. JE: We�re going to do it again in June. There�s more wall-space. And many of the artists are going to come back and re-paint over the areas where they have already painted. The strange thing is that we were told by many of the artists that we could expect the art to be up for a couple of weeks before it would get tagged. Well, it�s almost a year later. And most of the work has remained un-tagged. So there is a response, even from the community that would want to muck things up, there�s for the most part a response of a positive nature. People are interested. We connect all this with a block party. So that people in the neighborhood are connected with the artists. That reaches out to all of New York. We had people show up at the last block party from everywhere. GYE: We had done the block party three times before the art. We call it the Welling Court block party. And when we do it, everyone just brings out tons and tons and tons of food. The people in the neighborhood. We grill hamburgers, and people make their traditional food. There�s Mexican, there�s Peruvian, there�s Brazilian. And we have Greek too on the block. Some people are people who don�t really have a lot of money and yet they manage to bring something out. Even if it�s basic, it�s something to add to it. And tasty, oh my God! And we have this kind of feast together. We invite people to join us. But we�re going to put the word out this year that if you come, please bring something. Because the people on the block are not providing for like thousands of people! JE: Last year because it was the first time we extended it out, we did see some people who came in and they would have their own drink. They weren�t taking anything from anybody else. But you know, they just brought drink for themselves. I really would like to instill that feeling that we�re a broader community and that we�re all sharing. And if they can�t share food or drink or whatever, I�d ask that they make some contribution to the artists, you know. The artists are there doing an incredible thing not just for Welling Court and the blocks around it, but for all of Astoria. And really indirectly for all of New York. GYE: I mean all of those walls that are now covered with art were covered with terrible graffiti. I mean it was just a graffiti magnet. It was ugly. And kind of sad. We never knew when they were doing it. It would just appear. It was basically gang graffiti. JE: A lot of what they do is technically against the law. Interestingly even while we were doing this, there�s some kind of graffiti-removing unit that came along, and we got to talking with them. And they were like �this is fantastic�. We were saying �Jesus, don�t get rid of this!� And they said �This is art, we wouldn�t touch it! They recognized it immediately as art. The response from the community has been amazing. GYE: We had to get permission from every business whose walls are used. That took a while to get. There was a little resistance. There�s a school bus company. JE: There was some resistance from them. Because they didn�t know what to expect. There�s a hierarchy there that was a little bit hard to get through to the main person. But once I was able to talk to her, she was interested in what we were doing and said �yes, do it.� But I think initially she was unsure. Even when some of the paintings were going up, she had people within the organization who didn�t know we had permission. They were almost antagonistic to a couple of the artists. But what was very interesting � apparently people who were in the neighborhood watching the artists literally stepped in and stood up for them and said this is great, we want it. So to me, this is all community building. GYE: And it�s not like we�re a community of all artists, where everybody�s into you know, �let�s have our wall be arty-looking.� This is a community of mostly working people, largely immigrants, who do whatever work they do�some are homeowners and possibly professionals, others do whatever they do to survive. So it�s not like they have this attitude of �let�s be this art mecca.� They all are just excited that their street is not going to have ugly graffiti but instead will have something pretty interesting, unusual, and eye-catching. JE: One of the artists [M City] was from Poland. We had people from Brazil, from Chile, from Denmark. GYE: M City came in and did his piece a few months before. JE: He came in December. He was there over a Christmas holiday prior to all the other work being done. And one of our neighbors had an empty apartment and let him stay there for three days while he did it. Georgina and I never met him. We were away. And what was funny was that we thought he was going to do a different wall. So we heard that he was coming to work. Then we came back home and it was very late at night. We were in a cab. We drove up and I was so disappointed, I was like �oh it didn�t happen.� There was nothing on Welling Court. Then I walked out and on 30th Ave of course there was this magnificent piece of work. GYE: As it turns out, the bus company are really the ones who provided most of the wall. Because all the wall that�s across 30th Avenue, on the 30th Ave side and then around the corner, that�s all bus company walls. Plus the one that runs along Welling Court across from the M City mural. Basically all of the bus company walls and the gates are done now. JE: They�ve been really forthcoming now about allowing us to control the outside of their walls. They see that there is an impact in the neighborhood and I think they like that, as much as anybody. People are coming in now from outside the neighborhood to photograph it, to video. Music videos are being made on the street. It�s bringing a different sense of what a block is. There was a time just after the project when we found out that Welling Court had become one of the ten hottest places to visit for art in New York City. That, is cool! GYE: We were so blown away. JE: It was so unexpected. GYE: And again, and that�s without any sort of Williamsburgian gentrification. What Welling Court used to be known for before was that on December 11th ever year our neighbors organized a fiesta for the feast of the virgin of Guadalupe. So there was a little shrine that they built on our street. They invite everyone in the neighborhood, they go door to door to knock and invite people. They have mariachis and they bring pi�ata, and food, and invite everyone to join in. JE: We�d been in the neighborhood for about five years when that started. And the first time they did it was a surprise to us. GYE: It went on quite late into the night. It was very loud! We were like ok, we just need to be cool with this. Really you couldn�t sleep. JE: Then after that time they started inviting everybody to the celebration and warning us, so if you don�t want to come! GYE: Actually they seem to have kind of toned it down over the years. JE: Ever since we�ve started doing the block parties, now every time we walk down the street we all know each other in one way or another. GYE: There�s a group called Long Island City Alliance that I�ve belonged to for many years. It brings people together around issues of graffiti, over-development and things like that. That was largely responsible for helping to get a done-zoning happening in Astoria. To keep the crazy over-development out of some neighborhood. JE: Some areas realized that the down-zoning was going to be inevitable. Some builders did come in and really tear down 150-year old homes. Fantastic buildings. They knew that the community wouldn�t like it so they literally would go in and knock a house down in a day. Just surround it with plywood and knock it down. On 27th Avenue and 12th Street there�s e prime example of that. They tore out like 30 trees, and just decimated the area. Now there are condos. GYE: That organization also helps people to reach out into their own neighborhoods. Like if some in appropriate building is going on along your street, you can contact that organization then connect with other people who are concerned. And it helps you to get to know people in your neighborhood. In Astoria you can know not only your neighbors, but a lot of people. We know people all through Astoria, and into Long Island City and Sunnyside. We�re both from LA originally. But we met in New Mexico and then lived there and had our child and family started there. We came out here because, I went to college here. After I left New York back in the 80s and went out to New Mexico for a while to do some acting, I always knew that I wanted to come back. It took us a while to come back but now we�re here. I certainly want to stay now. I think that the tradition of New York City is development. It�s pretty hard to put the breaks on New York City development. You can�t really say no, we are not going to build buildings and develop. But I�m optimistic because of the progress we�ve already made in really keeping a handle on it. Keeping it under control, guiding it. I�m optimistic that this area and other small areas in New York City can grow and develop in a good and positive way. It�s kind of in my nature to be optimistic, but I do hope that I�m right about that. That we can do it without driving people out of their homes and rentals. That�s a big thing for me. Jackson Heights is going through the same thing. There are cool, cool local communities where the more people want to live here, and the more wonderful little places like this get built, the more rents go up and the more that people who were living there a long time get driven out. Then big box stores come in and then suddenly it�s not so desirable any more. It�s this whole wave of things that happen. I feel like right now there�s an awareness of that wave, and an awareness of how to try to counteract it. So far I see it going in the right direction. JE: I certainly like things like this place [Astor Bake Shop], coming into the neighborhood. And Vesta [Italian Trattoria]. They�re popping up. And it was daring for him [George McKirdy, owner of Astor Bake Shop] open this place up. To have that forward-thinking idea that this could work here, without changing the neighborhood. And it does. It fits into the neighbhoorhood. People who live here come here and support it and love it. I wouldn�t mind seeing more of that. I do however draw that line where I don�t want to see that cycle that Georgina was talking about happen here. There needs to be a balance. A good example of what works is the Piano Factory building. They went in and as far as I know, they gutted the inside. Then they re-built the condominiums inside that structure. And the outside of the structure was completely maintained. What a great thing to do. And what a contribution to the community. GYE: I have to say that there are some died-in-the-wall preservationists that would not be in favor of that. However for those of us who are willing to see that there is some flexibility, it�s so much better than tearing that building down. JE: There is a building that was built over there, basically just a box that they slapped up. It dazzles me that they would build a thing like that when they could have built something more pretty. People would love having this fantastic view of the water. Instead, all they could think to do was build a cube? What kind of mindset does that? And it�s right across the street from the piano factory. I can�t imagine somebody choosing one thing over the other. G: 21st Street is considered a corridor where there�s an exception from the down-zoning. It�s like a corridor where people are free to build. ",
  "Ellis_Josephine_timecode.txt": "Josephine Ellis is a long-term resident of Jamaica, Queens. In this interview, Josephine spoke about her experience living in Queens and how she grew up with her father, mother and her 7 older siblings. Religion was a key component in her life. She has wonderful memories of being part of the church community and participating in her foundation. 00:00:33 Introduction to Josephine Ellis’s experience and the reasons why she left West Virginia and move to Jamaica, NY. 00:00:48 Josephine’s parents migrated to Jamaica because her father’s coal mine had shutdown. Introduces her siblings; there are 7 sisters and 1 brother. Josephine is the youngest out of all of 8 siblings. Josephine was still with her parents, while the older siblings had already migrated to New York, after they graduated high school in West Virginia. 00:01:20 In July 1953, Josephine’s father and mother, and Josephine drove to NYC. 00:01:35 Josephine and her family visited NYC couple of times before, however, it was a little challenging for her because she was only 12 years old and she went to an integrated school with both white and black students, which she did not encounter in West Virginia. 00:01:58 Josephine, however, succeeded nicely at Edgar D. Shimer Middle School, when she was twelve years old and graduated at John Adam High School in 1957-1958. 00:02:16 Josephine worked with one of her sisters, Bunny. Bunny worked at an American Home Magazines on Queens Boulevard after graduating from high school. She was able to get her a position as a receptionist. She was a receptionist for about 2 years. 00:02:37 Josephine quit her receptionist job and went to the Savoy Ballroom, where she met her husband, Willy, with her sister at the age of 16. At that time, people didn’t have to show any identification, while being very tall; Josephine was able to get away a lot. 00:03:01 Josephine got married and had two daughters. 00:03:14 Once the children were in Kindergarten, Josephine went to work in the school system as a para professional and got into the Career Ladder Program and graduated with the Bachelor of Arts in Education. Josephine retired from the New York City Board of Ed. in 2010. 00:03:37 Josephine was married for 56 years. She is still very close to her siblings. Her family goes to same church. 00:04:00 Josephine’s memory of leaving West Virginia was sad, however, she is happy now because she knew the life in New York City would make her happy. Her older sister, Gladys, bought a home, where her family had lived. Josephine’s home was a 2 family house, her parents lived upstairs and Gladys lived downstairs. 00:04:21 The family has always had an understanding and foundation in the Lord and knowing that God is in their lives. Her children and their children still continued to create this type of environment, which is why we they are able to do this interview. 00:04:46 Kim, Caroline, Gloria, and Robin are their nieces who want to pursue this goal of legacy that the Palmer family have stored upon them. 00:04:57 Josephine is passing on her legacy to her nieces. They are embracing it and people are learning more about it because back in those days, people weren’t interested in all of the history that happening now and learning more about themselves than they expected. 00:05:44 When Josephine moved from West Virginia, her family moved 4 blocks away from their church, Antioch Baptist Church, where she was married there in 1960. 00:06:01 Reverend Charles Jefferson was the pastor that married them. There was an outdoor reception in the back. 00:06:10 In the Church, Josephine became an usher, sang in the choir, and she became a Deaconess in 1995. 00:06:20 Josephine’s husband, Willy, is Deacon as well. Due to her parent’s foundation, Josephine and Willy were very much part of creating programs, which gave her a new experience. 00:06:51 The Antioch Baptist Church is located in 107-14 Pinegrove St. Jamaica, NY 11435. 00:07:00 The house she lives in 107-16 Princeton St. Jamaica, NY 11435. At this point the interview switched to Gladys Oliver 00:07:11 Gladys was a teacher for Public School for 22 years. After she retired, she went to the Antioch Baptist Church to work with the young people. 00:07:36 In September 19, she came became the director of the Youth Department of the Antioch Baptist Church 00:07:49 At the church, there were many programs and activities for the children and Glady was the children’s teacher and there were youth activities in the church. 00:08:14 Gladys was the Director of Choir and Director of the Youth Department. 00:08:39 Kim worked with her in the church. 00:08:45 Gladys was an after school teacher and Director of the Vocation Bible school. 00:09:00 Gladys’ first experience of the church is when she joined after getting married. She came very involve with the youth activity. 00:09:30 Gladys would be 92 years old in March 3. 00:09:48 All of Gladys’ children were christened and married at Antioch Baptist Church. 00:10:49 Gladys used to live on Pinegrove St. and she moved to 135-36 Alwick Rd.

  "Ellis_Josh-ElannaWhite_timecode.txt": "Elanna White (EW): I�m a student and also an actress. Studying drama at NYU. Josh Ellis (JE): I am a music producer, writer, composer. I don�t know. I make music. EW: [On why their band is called Donner Social] Josh likes obscure references. JE: Manifest Destiny�I like Manifest Destiny. The story from all that which I like the most is the story of the Donner Party, where they decided it would be a wonderful romp through the woods and there would be an organ, I think they were going to California, and they thought they�d have lots of fun but they ended up eating each other. So the idea behind that is something normal, like a history lesson or a party or something, but that�s on the surface while underneath that there�s something quite a bit darker. That�s a theme with the band. EW: Josh and I have been making music with each other for a very long time. We were in a band together before this. I�m a singer and he played the guitar. It was one of those things that was a no-brainer I think. JE: We�d been writing music together for a long time. I mean since, god, since eighth grade when we were thirteen. EW: We graduated from Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. Now that�s in Astoria. Josh was only there three years and he was in a different school freshman year. I was there for four years. It was in LIS before it moved to Astoria. We knew each other from before high school. JE: Yes, we�d been writing music a long time and then the band that we were in kind of disbanded, and I was kind of left after that without a band. I didn�t know what I wanted to do. I had been playing around with a few production programs and digital music-making programs�before I was really doing rock but got into electronica through bands like The Postal Service. That made me realize I didn�t actually need all the musicians for a band, because I can be the musicians. I can do it myself. EW: It�s a long process making electronic music. JE: Some people think if you have a mac computer you�re automatically a pro musician. But that�s not at a serious level. Even at the beginning when I�d written some of the electronic music that I�d had in my head�I had written it but I didn�t want to be singing all of it, there was a missing component. And honestly that was Elanna. EW: He called me and said I don�t want to hear my voice on any of my songs any more, will you sing them all for me. And I said, ok, little did he know that meant well I�m going to write with you and I�m going to tell you what sounds good and sounds bad, in exchange for my soul! JE: She has a very good sense of sound. We don�t really disagree that much. Sometimes I�ll write a song that she won�t be wild about and honestly I�ll just take that as a sign that the song isn�t meant for the band, and I might use it for something else. One of the songs that you turned down a while ago, I presented to another artist and he went crazy over it and it worked out anyways. I really do trust her when it comes to the sound . Even when I�m writing it, I sometimes lose the sense of what the music is meant to be. She just has that in her head at all times, I really trust her in all that. EW: In our previous band there were five of us and we all have very different styles to what we do. I am primarily a musical theatre performer and that�s mainly what I do, and that�s what I�m the best at. So I had this grand sense of melodics, and harmonies � you just give me a piece of music and I can sing a harmony to it. But our guitarist was very into metal and he had all these metal riffs. JE: And our bassist was a jazz bassist! EW: It totally worked though. But there�s definitely a difference there when we were in our studio playing live at band practice versus electronica music, this is the backtrack, we can alter it etc. JE: We�ve only had one performance so far. We�re done writing the album but we�re going back reexamining it a bit before it�s released. It�s called �In Suspended Animation.� That show at National Underground [on Manhattan�s Houston Street] gave me a good sense about what we�re going to be looking at. We have a little bit more behind us now, like a lighting and sound person for live performances. Before we were super poor, now we�re just very poor! EW: We�re musicians. Re. being a native New Yorker: being born and raised here, you kind of forget where you�re living. It just kind of becomes another place where you live. You have to remind yourself wow this is New York City, people dream of coming here. We spent our late childhood and entire adolescence wandering around these streets, you know. JE: Getting lost on purpose. EW: Getting lost on purpose, wandering around these streets, walking down the same street every day because we had nothing else to do, you know. These endless summers and sleepless nights of just being here. And almost stagnantly. Because when you�re a teenager you can�t do all the things that we can do now. We just simply couldn�t. It took a toll on our music. It�s not just like another small town, so I think you have the contrast of almost having that small town dynamic in Astoria, where we knew every nook and cranny, and just to find something new was incredible. And yet we were in this huge giant city. JE: We did go into the city a lot. But you get to the point when you feel like you�ve done everything. Even in New York. People might think that�s absurd! But as kids we couldn�t go to all the fancy places everyone was going to, we didn�t really have a lot of money, we were just wandering and doing everything that we could do for free. EW: There was one summer where we literally went to the Museum of Moving Image, like at least three times a week. And MOMA all of the days when we weren�t at MOMI because we had just enough money for two subway fares and maybe a slice of pizza. JE: I feel like that kind of stuff is really reflected in the music. Because that kind of almost nostalgic, I�m not even sure what to call it, this feeling of having a towering city around you but almost feeling trapped in it. EW: Exactly. That�s what I meant by stagnant. JE: I mean we love it, we love this city. Especially now as we�re able to do more. But as a kid�the whole album is really about� EW: Trying to find imagination in something that you know so well. JE: Trying to find adventure. Trying to go down a path that you�ve gone down a trillion times and trying to find some sort of adventure in it. But there is none, you can�t find adventure in it� EW: Unless you have the right companion. JE: Or unless you get seriously lost, and sometimes you just have to have the right person to even be able to get lost with, you know? If you can�t get lost physically you can get lost mentally I supposed. No, we didn�t notice there were other musicians here when we were growing up. EW: Honestly no, actually. JE: Really the music scene in New York � the music scene is dead. There really is barely a music scene in New York. That�s me comparing that to Portland and Seattle, like all the ways over. New York used to have a really great punk scene. It used to have a lot of really great scenes. But those have really been more muddied by the random post-hardcore bands that are coming through. I love post-hardcore, I love EDM, but a lot of these types of music even though I like them, there�s just too much of the same genre. It�s really, really difficult to find any show that�s not just a band that you�ve heard a trillion times. Unless it�s a famous band coming through, you know. But a lot of the local bands�what would you say is the last New York band that you were really into?... EW: Errr�.. JE: I think there are a lot of people doing electronica but they are doing it in a different way. EW: I feel like there are a lot of people doing electronic but one thing about electronic is there�s a very certain aesthetic that comes to mind, although that aesthetic is not our aesthetic, in my head. JE: In other electronic when you hear the vocals in it it�s like sampled in. They are just part of the backtrack. It�s really only a backtrack, it�s just a big backtrack. And while there may be vocals in it, they don�t really mean anything, they are just words that sound good together, create a nice rhythm� EW: Well going back to my background, everything that I write vocal-wise is very melodic. JE: And storytelling. EW: Yes, and the way that I write word-wise always tells a story. And I firmly believe in art that tells stories. So from that standpoint I feel like the vocal lines in our music are so strong. We have this one song that�s called Dead Pixel that�s one of my favorites. It�s just instrumental but even that I feel tells this enormous story. I�ve kind of been trying to figure out what it is, and have found myself listening to that song over and over again. Because it�s not just sound for the sake of sound I suppose, which is something that I personally I�m not the biggest fan of. One of the screening tests that the songs that are written go through with me is like, I have to have a song bring me to a certain place that I really feel. For me to really feel that this song is amazing. JE: By the way I understand this feeling completely and I know exactly what it is� EW: Josh knows. JE: But I can�t necessarily feel it with the song that I have been listening to over and over and over again. We tend to have this feeling for the same things. So if she�s feeling it I assume that I would too if I hadn�t heard it a million times before. You know. EW: And I guess it fits that I�m the resident feeler because I�m an actress. Most of the songs I actually can say, most of the songs that affect me like that bring me to this place where you start to formulate your own idea�your imagination automatically starts creating this story that goes along with it. JE: Even if I have some of the lyrics I don�t always know what it�s about and I�ll ask her and then continue�because she�s right! EW: I�m always right! JE: I�m juggling a bunch of things. Right now, I mean I�m in two other bands with completely different kinds of music, I run a record label and a studio out of my house, alongside my day job. I work at an early childhood development program thing. Don�t put that in the interview! No, you can put in whatever you want. It really is just a day job. I went in telling them that. A lot of people are there because their life is going to be little kids. I told them the only reason I�m taking the job is so that I have the money to support my record label. And I produce a few other artists on top of that. EW: We record them in his house. Writing-wise it�s whoever gets there first. If I write something I send it to him, if he writes something he sends it to me and then we sew together the pieces. And we record in whatever time we have. My schedule is super-rigorous and his is super-busy too. It�s definitely like patchwork. But it works. It seems to work. As masochistic as it might be I thrive on that kind of thing, you know [juggling lots of things at once]. There�s something so exhilarating and liberating when you�re so crazed with so much creative energy. It�s crazy. JE: I�ve had an idea for a while for recording with a band where there would go and do a show and then right after the show you would drive them over to the studio and immediately record. So the music has that level of energy that you don�t get if you wake up, go to the studio, record. If you�ve just been at a show and you�ve just played for all your fans and you go and record it, it�s going to have a very different energy to it. You�re capturing that moment. When you just have a minute to record and have no other time to do it, the way that you are feeling at that moment and the things that are going on around you, you can feel it in the vocals. EW: Yes, that�s true. JE: We have some songs and I feel if you listen to them you can really feel what�s going on around. Welling Court has become a much tighter community. I know who everybody is now. I was born in Santa Fe New Mexico and moved here when I was six. When I first moved to that block it was like just craziness. I was a little kid and there were tons of other little kids everywhere. Mostly from immigrant families. It was tons of fun. Then as I got older everyone left and there were more random people that I didn�t know, that no-one knew. Then we started having the block parties. And now I know all my neighbors. I have neighbors over for dinner on occasion�it�s a nice community, everyone knows each other, you know. The murals and the block parties�while the block parties are happening the murals are being painted. It brings us together in a pretty interesting way that I�ve never experienced ever. I don�t have any intentions of leaving Astoria. EW: It�s so close to everything. JE: I would go visit Paris for a few months or something, or Tuscany, places like that, and I also go to Tucson Arizona a bit because my grandparents live out there. But I don�t think I could every really live anywhere else. It has all of that� EW: I live on Broadway between 35 and 36 Street and my parents own Broadway Silk Store, across the street from the funeral home. That store has been in our family for like 90 years. So I have this really rich sense of history in Astoria. One of the things I love is that everything is up very late at night. I�m a New Yorker so of course I�m a night owl! So it�s nice for me that at 2am if I want to go on a Mexican food run with my best friend who�s sleeping over is that we can do that. I also realized I can get food from anywhere in the world within a two block radius from my house! Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food, Chinese food, pizza, Italian�and that�s one of the things I love it�s just this hub for culture. JE: It�s a difficult thing because these days at first glance when you think about the internet you think well anyone around the world can hear our music, and that�s true, and that�s an amazing thing. But at the same time anyone around the world can hear it. So now we�ve all moved from analogue to digital�people don�t have to go into a store to steal music any more. In a lot of ways the concept of buying a record is dead. I do, but I�m one person. I still buy vinyl. There�s almost no reason for anyone to buy music other than if they�re thinking well I want this artist to continue making music so I�ll buy their CD. So you have to find new ways of getting people to give you money for your music. Whether that�s by going to a show or buying some merchandise, or maybe there�s something on an album that for some reason you can�t get online. We got the money behind us now mostly from my day job, also from getting commissioned to write soundtracks for films, artists paying to use the studio, stuff like that. Almost all of my money goes back into my label and back into music. The rest of it goes into pizza. EW: Taiwan, England, Japan [are places I�d like to play]. JE: For some reason I really want to go play in Peru. We will let this band become anything that it becomes. We can really make it our own. I was saying �my own before�but my own is really her own too� because we have the same ideas on stuff. We don�t really conflict on style. It�s true we were meant to make music together. EW: We�re both nineteen now. JE: That�s one of the things about being in New York. When people come here wanting to be an actress o wanting to be a famous singer, you know I feel like people who grow up in New York have this advantage over the people who come here. People come here and get here and have all these dreams they don�t even know where to start. Even if they have a connection here they don�t have the sense that New Yorkers have. Whereas we have an advantage. We know where to go, we know the places we want to market to even, we know the scene. We�re not really competing with the other people who come here, we�re competing with other New Yorkers. Many times I�ve seen a band play and I�ve thought I�m sure you�re not from here. EW: You also grow up a lot faster in New York. I mean I�m only 19 years old but sometimes I feel so old! I mean especially because I have really bad child actor syndrome as well, so it�s like I�ve been doing this for so long. I�ve been working professionally in the city since I was like 8 years old. And I know the twists and turns of the industry, and I know what I need to do, and I know how close I�ve been to x, y and z. I mean once you do that and you grow up living in it, you have an innate sense� JE: Initially it seems not so great. But I really think that the thing that gives us that extra little thing is that anyone can have the ideas we have or do the things that we are doing, market to the people that we�re marketing to � anyone in New York � the difference is that one, those people don�t have the means to have an idea and record what they are doing. On top of that people can have all these ideas but we�re the only ones who are really trying to do it. EW: [The Broadway Silk Store] was my great grandparents� � my grandmother�s mother, her family they had seven kids and they came maybe during WW1 from Austria. They had two fabric stores, one where we have the store now and one on Steinway. My grandma was born and raised there, she went to Bryant High School and we own two buildings close to each other. I grew up in the one that�s two buildings away from the one we�re in now. When we were eight my great, great aunt passed away and we moved into where we are now, just above the fabric store. So it�s been in this town for ever. My mom runs the store now and my dad�s a chef. We help out and stuff. We have a basement area and we have old pictures from how Astoria used to be with the trolley line and stuff like that. It�s such an old place with so much history. There�s something innately charming about the neighborhood, partly because a lot of it is small businesses. JE: And there are a lot of old buildings too, like mine is over 100 years old. A lot of the buildings in Astoria are the original buildings. ",
  "Engel_Paul_timecode.txt": "Paul Engel�s interview is part of Queens Borough President Helen Marshall�s Queens General Assembly documentation project. Mr. Engel and fellow Queens General Assembly member, Richard Khuzami met with the Borough President�s Special Assistant on Immigrant & Inter-cultural Affairs, Susie Tanenbaum, to record oral history interviews about their personal histories and their experiences on the Queens General Assembly. Engel shares some background on his parents� careers and his educational history. He also discusses his involvement as a young man with the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon and how that impacted his later professional involvement with cult deprogramming work. Some of Paul Engel's first exposure to multicultural work leading up to his appointment to the Queens General Assembly, was through a project he led on behalf of the Flushing Jewish Community Council that provided services to people from many cultures as a requirement of a grant they got. His continued work with clergy from many different faiths led to an event that helped to counter the backlash against Muslims and Sikhs in the aftermath of 9/11 in 2001. A highlight of Engel�s recollections of the Queens General Assembly is from the Festivals of Light celebration on January 20, 2004. Engel describes his part in the program, lighting menorah candles as Rabbi Avraham Schechter spoke about traditions surrounding Chanukah. Engel's spontaneous gesture of assistance during the subsequent presentation by Andrew Jackson, resulted in a powerful moment symbolizing the unity of the Queens General Assembly. 00:03:51 Mother worked on Sid Caesar shows, Your Show of Shows included.

  "Espiritu-Santo_Yokaira_timecode.txt": "My name is Yokaira Espiritu Santo. The patients here call me Doctor Santo for short. And I�m a podiatrist in Astoria. I have no idea what the origin of Yokaira is. A lot of patients ask me. I suppose I should look it up, but I don�t really want to know. It�s my name, it�s me, I guess. When I was younger I had chronic in-growing toenails. I would go into the bathroom and play with my feet. That caused them to be in-grown. It wasn�t until I saw a podiatrist, after multiple visits to my pediatrician, who kept taking them out (mind you he was about 80 years old), and they just kept recurring. It wasn�t until I saw the podiatrist that they were cured. Well cured is the wrong word, but he stopped them recurring. There�s never an actual cure for anything, per se. I was very grateful and happy that I could wear my sandals and my open toe shoes, and paint my toenails etc. So I became a podiatrist because of that. Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician. Inspired by that 80 year old pediatrician. Usually you go to college for 4 years and you major in biology or science, and do pre-med classes. Then you go to podiatry school which is another 4 years. Then you go to 3-4 years surgical training, in a residency, certified by the American Association of Podiatric Medicine. And then you become a podiatrist. So it�s pretty much more the same standard as normal medical school, but you�re just geared more towards the lower extremity. I did all my training in New York. I went to school in New York College of Podiatric Medicine in Manhattan. And I did my training in New York Hospital of Queens, in Flushing. I enjoy meeting people and helping them out in terms of their problems, making them feel better. Usually people come in here with pain and discomfort, and you know, we treat them and they leave to some extent pain free and happy in terms of their foot. One of the common things that we treat here is heel pain. Also in-growing toenails. We also see a lot of diabetic patients and do a lot of preventative care so that they won�t lose their feet due to poor circulation or amputation or infections. We treat children. And I guess the whole gamut of things. Sometimes we do surgeries. To deal with bunions, and hammer toes. We treat a lot of trauma as well. Like ankle sprains and fractures. If people stand a lot for work or if they are runners they definitely damage their feet a lot. Patients that stand up a lot at work definitely have more wear and tear on their feet. Also the shoes that you wear are a factor. If I know that a certain pair of shoes is causing discomfort. Or if they�re wearing a certain pair of sneakers. Like for example we definitely promote a lot of New Balance sneakers because they come a little bit wider and they have better arch support for patients. We try to steer them away from Nikes even though that�s like the main brand that people usually wear. Everybody�s always happy that comes through this office. Most of the people that I encounter, everybody�s always happy, everybody has a different story, everybody comes from all different walks of life. This summer everyone�s telling me about their vacations, what they did do, didn�t do. They talk about their kids, their grandkids. I see one patient, and that patient brings me their mom or their father or their girlfriend. It turns into a family event here at times. Sometimes I have a whole family in one day. I definitely appreciate the fact that they trust me and that they bring other people and refer other people to come here. It�s pretty cool. I work in this office as well as the one in Sunnyside and also the one in Manhattan. We rotate around. In the Manhattan office, everyone wants the quick fix, in and out, fix me as soon as possible I�m on my lunch break kind of mentality. Or I want to go home, I just got out of work. Here people have more time and they come on their days off. Or we have more elderly people coming into our office than in Manhattan. Dr Hans was my attending when I was a resident. He trained me in the hospital � he went there when he had cases and stuff like that. And then he said �come on, you have to work with me! I�ve known him for about six, seven years. And started working with him about two years ago. The part I least enjoy is paperwork. I see maybe 20 to 30 patients a day and then for every patient I need 10 to 15 minutes worth of paperwork. If it�s a new patient it takes me another 30 minutes per chart. So it�s a lot of paperwork. And I think most medical professions, they don�t like the paperwork. It�s increasing, because I see more patients. I�ve been taking lots of work home. When you�re home, you want to relax. You know you get home, you want to relax, you�ve put in 12 hours and you just want to relax. Usually I�m here 12 hours. It�s a brutal schedule. We have a brutal schedule. Usually I can�t leave the office for my break. So usually we have stuff delivered here to the office, either from the pizzeria across the street. And Ghandi (Indian restaurant). I love that place. I usually go there at least once a month on a Monday with my girlfriend and we enjoy dinner there, pretty late. I have to wait for her to get out of the hospital. But I make it happen, at least once a month. I commute. And that�s killing me. That�s another thing I hate about my job! I commute from New Jersey. It�s frustrating in terms of tolls, and the time it takes, and the frustration because of traffic. But you know, I definitely like the people in the office. And people are like �Dr Santos don�t ever leave!� And I�m like I�ll try not to, but being 2, 3 hours in traffic, sometimes it�s rough. I just moved to Jersey two years ago. Hopefully soon I�ll start a family over there. I don�t want to live in the city any more, I lived here for 10 years already. I lived in Manhattan for five and then in Flushing for four. I was born in Dominican Republic but moved here when I was two years old. I lived in New Jersey most of my life. I went to college in New Jersey, I went to Rutgers University. And then I started my medical school in Manhattan and residency in Flushing. Career-wise I would like to have my own practice. State-of-the-art everything. And in an ideal world, have lots of rooms, work three times a week, do surgery one day a week. Possibly join a residency program where I could train other people to become podiatrists. Maybe do teaching lectures here and there. Maybe do trauma here and there. But the problem with trauma is that you always have to be on your pager, with your pager next to your hip. So I�ll probably just do trauma call once or twice a month. (laughs). That�s my ideal. Oh and I�d dictate all of my charts instead of handwriting them. It will take some time and a lot of energy on my part. I definitely want three kids and I�ve got to start soon! My time is ticking. I want two girls and a boy. I already have their names and everything! Definitely want that. ",
  "Fabiano_Phil_timecode.txt": "Phil Fabiano was born in the 1960s in South Ozone Park, Queens. Throughout his life, he has moved four times. However, he has stayed in the neighborhood because he has a great love for Ozone Park and believes it is a great close-knit neighborhood to raise a family. Although this part of Queens has changed since Phil was a child, he says his children were lucky enough to experience some of what he did growing up. 00:00:43 Phil was born in South Ozone Park and his first home was a small house right off Rockaway Boulevard. He recalls this house as being a tiny, two-bedroom home. He moved from this residence when he was six years old. 00:01: When Phil was nine years old in 1970 he moved to 92nd Street across from a parish. He lived here for twenty years. The population did not fluctuate much over the period of time. Phil recalls a slight population increase in the 1980s, which led to a more culturally diverse neighborhood. 00:05:53 During the 1990s, Phil moved to a house in Wakefield near the Aqueduct Racetrack with his parents and sister. He described this location as convenient because it was close to his job at JFK Airport. He lived at this location for ten years. 00:06:47 Phil says things haven’t changed much during his ten years at Wakefield. The main difference he noticed was the cultural gap getting smaller. During this time, he had stopped participating in many outdoor activities, such as basketball, so he did not know his neighbors very well. 00:07:55 When Phil got married, he decided to stay in the neighborhood. This is because he saw Ozone Park as a great place to raise a family. He also wanted his children to attend the same school that he did as a child. 00:12:30 Phil says the neighborhood was now changing. It is more diverse culturally and religiously (there aren’t as many Catholics as there once was). 00:13:55 Phil talks about the changes in outdoor and green spaces in South Ozone Park. While he was growing up in the 1960s, Phil says there were many farms by Lindenwood. He now notes the area is more congested and crowded with buildings. 00:18:09 Phil says the neighborhood lacks as many parks. These parks have been converted into once new schools. 00:21:20 Growing up, Phil says he didn’t wanted to live in any other neighborhood. He wanted his kids to experience the same enjoyment he did as a child and they “kind of did” experience somewhat of he did growing up. The school he went to, Nativity, helped create that close-knit bond within the neighborhood. 00:22:10 Phil went to Thomas Edison High School in Jamaica, Queens. His zone school was John Adams High School in Ozone Park, Queens. However, he father did not want him to attend John Adams as he wanted his son to learn a trade (which Edison offered) that he could use in the future. He learned the skill of air conditioning and refrigeration. However, instead of using his newly acquired skill, he got a job at JFK airport in the 1980’s and continues to work this to this day. 00:31:23 Phil recalls attending the 1964 World’s Fair. Even though he was only three or four years old, he remembers his mother pushing him around in a stroller. He described this as a “space age” because of all the new, modern technology. He was especially fascinated by glow in the dark paint and an exhibition for microwaves at the World’s Fair. ",

  "Falco_Gieseppe_timecode.txt": "My name is Giuseppe Falco and I'm the owner of Vesta Trattoria and Winebar in Astoria. I've lived in Astoria for ten years now and I went to high school in Astoria. It was a different neighborhood for sure then. It has always been very community-oriented though. It's always been a community that's very involved with their children, and what's going on in Astoria. Everyone seems to know each other. It's a really small place even though its actually a vast area. There has definitely been a group of young professionals that have moved in a lot more. It seems to have got much younger. Three words I would use to describe the neighborhood: Devoted. Tight-knit community. Arts-oriented. And for sure diversity, too. It�s probably the most diverse place I�ve ever heard of. It�s incredible how many large communities live in one community. The way that you have a large Greek population that lives next to a large Egyptian population that lives next to a large Bangladeshi population that lives next to a large Italian community. My father, mother and siblings were all born in Italy, though I was born here by a few years � they were born in Sicily. I was at high school with Leo, my best friend since we were five. I was in the restaurant business and he was in IT. We�d always talked about starting a business. We had such strong ties in Astoria, that it made sense to do it here. Actually I live about five blocks away. And there was such an incredible amount of building on 21st Street. We felt like we were priced out of the main area on 30th Avenue and on Broadway and Ditmars. It also felt like the young generation that was moving into Astoria was looking around the outskirts, around the edges of Astoria. It�s been a full two years and three or four months we�ve been open now. A lot of the young people who have moved into Astoria have found us. They�ve found a place where they can feel comfortable. That was the whole idea of Vesta, it was supposed to be a place where you can come in have a glass of wine, have a soup, or just not have anything. We do a pretty good job of sourcing every ingredient that we use locally. Sometimes it�s not completely possible but every year it gets easier. People are catching on to the idea that it doesn�t make sense to get an apple from Chile when you can have an apple from ten miles away in upstate New York. Brooklyn Grange are growing not even a mile and a half away from us here, on a roof. It really is the way things were done fifty years ago, eighty years ago, and we�ve just gotten away from it. I�m more optimistic than I�ve ever been about the local sourcing movement. My approach and opinion to everything I do is that the moment you wake up and don�t feel challenged is the moment that everything fails. I try to challenge myself with the smallest thing every day, and think that the smallest things can be the biggest challenges. Biggest achievement I would say it�s that we�ve managed to develop a group of 100 or 150 people who eat here once, twice, three times a week. To me that�s completely amazing. You can come in here on a Friday night and be sitting next to someone you ate with last Thursday or Friday, to me that blows my mind. It was never set but I definitely feel like one of the most positive things you can feel in a restaurant is when you can see the same faces all the time, that�s what I�d say is our greatest achievement.

It's beautiful there now. Before you couldn't walk over there in the night. New buildings are coming up now. Now you have to havea little tiny car just to get a spot to park, not like before. Really I came to Astoria because I had friends here. I work in a warehouse - 40 hours a week, I'm getting old now. Ahmed: I want to be a doctor. The one that works with the heart. Abdel: I socialize with Greek, Italian people�from Egypt, Spain, Mexico. You see a lot of variety, culture everything, you know. I see that Astoria is much better now - the population is up, so the service is much better. Ahmed: I really would like to go to live in London! People go there because doctors go there - I want to be a good doctor. Abdel: Sometimes we go to different cafes, one Sunday here, the other time the bakery at 32nd, sometimes to 7/11. There are very good places now. It wasn't before like this. About five, six years ago it really started to change. The quality of cafes and restaurants got a lot better. It's good living here. ",

And so a year or to after that some friends of mine from that city- it was Milwaukee, said well, you know let all move to New york together! So four of us came, and we found a loft right off of Queensboro bridge and we lived there. I was there not quite a year and then I met someone and we moved together into a loft two blocks from here so this has been, you know, artistically my home base for 36 years. DG: Well, so you moved here for artistic reasons, right, what brought you particularly to this area? Cause I see that you lived in Long IC astoria and woodside area that’s very close. KF: When we came out, we bunked with a friend of ours who lived in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and at the time that was a totally undeveloped neighborhood, it was pretty wild. It was about a 10 minute walk from the F stop on J street which is right now, you know, prime dumbo real estate, grand central. But there was not much there when we came. It was 1981 you know, things were very rough on the subways. Anyway we sleep on his living room floor for 3 or 4 weeks while we hunted for a place to live. And we thought we all would do better if we got a loft together. So we used this strategy of hunting where we just walked north from his place. So we walked through williamsburg, we walked through greenpoint, we basically followed the river north- some main streets and we really hunted for a place we could afford. There were a lot of awful places we saw -we’re like we don’t thinks so- and at the time the landlords were really they didn’t care if you were a bunch of artists and you were gonna live there. They didn’t care. They didn’t care if you didn’t have heat on the weekends, they just - there were no loft laws there was none of that. You just came you got a place you paid the rent and you lived there. So we found this place it was the top floor of a factory on 9th street right off of 59th street bridge and we moved in and it was cut up into rooms that had been some kind of- I don’t know I guess it was busted for- they were making some kind of drugs there. So they busted everybody and kicked em out and I think the landlord was left hanging with a lease we didn’t find that out for a fact but we heard rumors that it was like a meth lab or something like that. We don’t know. We don’t really know. But anyway we moved in, we had to build a shower in the bathroom, we had to build a kitchen so we were working - we got a refrigerator, we worked with hot plates for quite a long time. There literally was no heat in the winter time so it was a very cold winter. There was no heat on the weekends but there was heat 9-5 so monday through friday it was nice and toasty 9-5 so by the time Saturday morning rolled around it was chilly. But we lived there, put our bikes in the- we had a great big locking door, we put our bikes in the foyer and lock em to the stairwell. I mean it was kind of rough and tumble but we each had a glorious studio. I had a very tiny place to sleep but I had this really beautiful studio overlooking midtown and it was just terrific. Very exciting. You could imagine im 25 years old i’m in New York I’m living my dream I have a part time job i’m painting all the time and it was like OK, here we go! So after we found that place and after I left that place I wasn’t interested in like oh let’s discover brooklyn- so when it was time to find a place with my at the time boy friend we just did the same thing, we went up river. and we found this place we used to go to a pizza place down in Long Island City. Guy that owned it his name was Sal, and Sal knew everybody. He was italian, my boyfriend was Italian so we would go in there and have pizza and beer or whatever. So when we were ready to move we just said “Sal, you know of any place?” “Yeah! Go talk to Newman, Newman’s got a place,” and so I mean we didn’t really look that hard, Newman had a place and we went and it was very reasonable rent, it was 100 ft deep by 25 ft wide. And so we built a living space in the back again we built- it was raw space we built a loft bed, a bathroom, a kitchen, we got a new refrigerator, we had a beautiful garden in the back. And there was property on the left and on the right of the building that was connected and they connected it in the back with a chain link- they had guard dogs back there. And so we felt really safe because here we are we’re in this “U” we’re surrounded in the back by guard dogs, you’re not gonna get in the front of the building it was very secure. We were very happy there. I think we stayed there, we got married while we were living there maybe 2 or 3 years and then wind started to change around real estate I think it was ‘85. I finished my masters degree when we were there and it really started- real estate started to change then- it was the mid 80’s ‘85-’86. I think it was the fall after my graduation that he came by and raised- tripled our rent- we were like “nah we’re not gonna pay that.” So we were both working at a cab company- I was driving cab- he was fixing cabs that’s how we met. It was over in woodside and so we said well you know what if we split housing and work space and we get an apartment close to work so Paul is his name- didn’t have to go far for work- he could just basically walk to work- I could do the same and then so we split living and studio and I found a studio exactly a block away from here and I was there for 22 years. And we got a house in astoria- I mean an apartment in astoria four room apartment and then after awhile we started a family and when our son was not quite 2, we decided to buy a house. We actually wanted to buy a house before we had a family but that didn’t work out. It was kind of tough. Interest rates were really high but Paul’s parents were here and they were very interested in having access to their grandchild- the only one at the time. So they were very supportive and helpful and actually my mother in law said well around the corner from our apartment about 2 blocks away there’s a house for sale why don’t you call the realtor and go look at it! It was an estate sale and we offered and they said well if you come up- I can’t remember if it was 2 or 5 thousand dollars, the house is yours and we were like really/ we were shocked but we closed on it and that’s it. We’ve had that house, lived in that house, raised three kids there, I was in the studio a block away for 22 years and then that building was sold to an islamic religious group they were fundamentalists, they put a school in the building. I think we were there for about 4 years after the building was sold and then one day they just asked us all to leave- it was very uncomfortable. We were all ready to leave by the time they wanted us to leave. And so I was on the 3rd floor and there was a business on the 2nd floor and when they asked us to leave I went down and talked to the business and said do you guys know where you’re gonna go? There were 5 artists on the 3rd floor, myself included and they said well no we really don’t know where we’re gonna go. I said ok, so I went- I knew a lot of people in the neighborhood because I’d been in the neighborhood a long time at that point. I don’t remember who suggested I go see Jimmy, but Jimmy was another stand-by Italian guy who’d lived in this neighborhood his whole life and so I went to see Jimmy. He was just right around the corner had this wonderful dog- him and his buds used to sit outside the little deli a block away with Rocky was the dog’s name and they would buy rocky coffee, Rocky always had to have his coffee- anyway Jimmy said yeah go see Hans. Hans has a building on 12th street it’s right around the corner. So I thought ok so I went walked around the corner, can’t miss the building- that’s this building- and the door was up so I walked in and called “Hello, Hello?” and Hans was there he’s of German- he’s a German guy and he had just sold his business and so I asked him I said is your upstairs for rent? How big is it? He kind looked at me like really? Are you crazy? But we came up and it was pretty rough. It had teeny tiny little windows, it was a mess and he said give me some time i’m gonna to renovate it and then you can have it. I said “really?” and he said, “yeah,” I said, “OK how much time?” Because I think we were on a tight schedule, he said, “give me a couple weeks.” So I would drive by all the time, meanwhile I started to clean out my studio and I thought I’m not gonna be a gullible person. I’m a New Yorker now, this guy is really not gonna fix this place up it’s gonna be a dump, I should just keep looking. So I did. But one day I was driving down Broadway and at the time all the buildings were low, you could see over and I looked over and I was like oh my god there’s huge windows in the back of Hans’s building- he had put these windows in. So I drove around the front and was like look at that! the windows are 4ft by 6ft and he put 7 of them in. So the space, it’s East-West, its beautiful light. The previous windows were probably a foot by 2 feet. They were teeny tiny and so I was like well he’s keeping his word! So I stopped in and he said yeah come on up I’ll show you what we’ve been doing and I just about - I was floored when I walked in. He had lowered the ceiling to put in a new ceiling, he put in central air conditioning which i’d never had- he put in this beautiful kitchen with granite countertops, gorgeous new cupboards, new bathrooms, I mean he- new flooring, all new heating and he had fixed up downstairs also. I don’t quite remember the exact time line but I told the guy and I said we should take that building together. And so I had Jeff who is one of the partners downstairs- I introduced him to Hans to negotiate because I thought the space here is about 1000 sq feet the space downstairs is 4500 square feet its huge, plus they have a huge backyard so they negotiated a very favorable lease and we all moved in. So- worked out! DG: Yeah, That’s crazy, you got lucky I guess! you found people! KF: Yeah, the universe is watching out for us. DG: So the transition to becoming a New Yorker, that was pretty natural I guess it came right, or? KF: Think there’s a certain kind of energy you have when you’re in your 20’s. I mean my kids are in their 20s now and I can see that same energy. It’s different than when you’re middle aged but I can remember, I had a series of weird jobs before I started working at the cab company. I didn’t want a full time job- my job was being an artist so I just wanted something I can support myself with and I got a job on Canal Street working with -they called them jobbers. But they were companies that bought and resold things connected with the fashion industry so this jobber was a leather dealer and he would buy lots of leather and then resell them. That’s what he did. I can’t remember what I did at the job I think I lasted 2 about months and then I got a job as an administrative assistant to an insurance salesman. I was in the 666, 5th avenue building I think I lasted there about 3 or 4 months, not very long. I wasn’t cut out for that kind of office work- I mean I could do the work but I just didn’t like that you had to dress right, you had to wear high heels. And the job I had in Wisconsin before I came here was a third shift job, and it was part time- I drove truck for the Milwaukee Sentinel, delivering bundles of newspapers to kids who had paper routes. And I was what’s called a relief manager. So the managers needed days off so I would come in and do their- take care of their carriers and I think I worked for like, worked with 3 managers or something like that and it was a really fun job because it was third shift it paid great. I mean I think I made 7.50 an hour in 1980 which was really a lot of money then. I don’t know what minimum wage was back then it was probably like a dollar 80 an hour or something but different times. So I thought well I really liked that driving job, why don’t I get- why don’t I look for a job driving cause I really would like to learn the city better. So I saw this Ad in a newspaper for drivers for private car service and I thought I bet I could do that. I went in, they interviewed me they said “yeah! You got A3 license?” I was like, “uh no.” They said, “well get one and come back when you got it.” So I went to Staten Island, I must’ve done my research to find out who gives these licenses, I had to take a road test but they gave me a cab license and so I went back and they hired me and I worked I think I drove for maybe 4 years, 4 or 5 years but the cab job funded my Masters of Fine Arts Degree from Hunter, and it funded most of my Masters of Education Degree from Teachers College. So that was like 1983 to 1990. I also dispatched for a while, which I was terrible at. But it was really fun. I learned New York, I always drove 2nd and 3rd shift, I would drive like Friday night and Saturday night from 6pm to 6am and Thursday night I drove from 4 o’clock to midnight or something like that. It was a minimal amount of time on a job and it was really fun. Met all kinds of crazy people, there’s this woman who would call us up in the summertime cause she had insomnia and she would ask us to drive her out to river head cause she had a diner out there she really liked. So they had a code for this call of this woman going to Riverhead, I don’t remember what the code was but I think I got her 2 or 3 times. She was a little loony but she paid cash, and it was like she just wanted to get in the car and go somewhere when it was hot out. DG: That’s cool. So you said teaching, you went to Teaching College. KF: I did. I got a degree in Masters in Education. I purposefully did not take my test to become state certified because I thought if I did that, my family would never leave me alone until I got a full time teaching job and there would be no more studio time and so I thought I’ll just teach part time I will find gigs. I tried to get college work. I adjuncted for a little while but there was also at the time a Nason organization and new approach to teaching where arts processes were taught integrated with subject content so arts ‘in’ education is the way it was defined and I was asked liked three months into teaching for a small organization in South East Queens. I was asked to pilot a project for the New York State Council in the Arts and I really liked it. I took to it like a duck to water I guess and it became something that was easy to do easy to balance work time, studio time, family time, so I’ve been a consultant in the realm of education for 30 something years. DG: So can we talk a little about about How Queens has affected your growth as an artist and how this community has changed? KF: There’s an organization called Long Island City artists incorp. Which I was a part of for a long time I sat on their board for a while. I don’t really do much work with them anymore but the reason I bring them up- they have probably been around for 35 maybe close to 40 years. But they were like the main organization that gave visibility to artists who were living and working in Western Queens. And so they were a great group to network with, show with, all kinds of stuff. The Queens Council in the Arts has also been very accessible and very supportive of all of its artists, not just visual artists. And so there was a kind of accessibility in Queens that allowed you to function as a professional artist, get support, collaborate with others and grow professionally. And plus you were in New York City so you had the access to the market place in whatever way you wanted to pursue that access. So I think Queens was for me, a very great haven. It was a place to really mature as an artist, to be recognized as a professional artists, and to really have a rich community of other artists around me. It’s been an incredible place to live and there’s all kinds of very well recognized and famous artists that are from here. Two blocks away is the Isamu Noguchi garden museum. I remember when that opened. I remember meeting him at the opening of that place. Nobody was- it was a small opening, people in the art world who knew him came, some local artists came, but I was living two and a half blocks from this museum when he put it together and renovated and opened it. It was amazing. I was like I thought this is so cool, this is close to where we live, it’s very cool. I went to- Paul and I went to parties at Mark di Suvero’s studio which is right by the Astoria ferry now. He used to open up- I think one of the parties we went to was on July 4th. He opened up his studio and had neighbors come in and a the time he was putting together the Socrates Sculpture park which is a block away. Without these building there you can actually see it. So he was very interested in building relationships in the community so he hired a lot of people from the projects. This neighborhood is bookended by two major housing projects. One is right down by the 59th street bridge, it’s a very large housing project, and then one is right up here at the end of Astoria Boulevard. And so back in the early 80’s, Vernon Boulevard was a scary place because there was a lot of traffic between the projects and there was a lot of poverty along the boulevard, it wasn’t developed. So for him to build a sculpture park and hire people from the projects that were living in poverty and build relationships with them was a really brilliant thing to do. His park was never once violated. There was never any graffiti, there was never any vandalism, there was never any of that, and that’s because of how he brought it into the community. And so that was like my community. And that was a major thing. It was- I don’t think I ever benefitted professionally from knowing di Suvero, I never like knocked on his door and said, “can you recommend me for a grant? Can you help me get into a gallery?” it wasn’t like that. It was just that they were there, I would go to the park and everybody had dogs, they love dogs, and we would just visit. It’s like a neighborhood. So it was cool. DG: So can we talk about how this area, Long Island City has evolved over the years into what it is today with the high buildings, what it was like before? KF: So, I was born and raised on a dairy farm in central Wisconsin and that background has always made me very sensitive to, and aware of any kind of garden. And so when I first moved into this neighborhood, when Paul and I were living on 31st Avenue, I used to walk up to the subway which is like a 15 minute walk, and I would go by all of these houses that were- Italians were living in them and there would be a house, and an empty lot- a house, and an empty lot. Or it would be two houses joined and empty lots on either side and all the Italians had fruit trees and fig trees, and tomatoes and gardens and I would love the walk because it’s like oh you planted a plum tree this year or oh! Lots of pumpkins this year and oh! They must be making wine- there’s all these empty wine crates outside. It was like- it resonated with me as a community of people who had gardens. But then as the real estate thing started to change, and the older Italians died off, they sold those empty lots and built. And so gradually over like 10 years, 15 years, I saw all those gardens get paved over and built over, and now there’s only a few of them left. And I saw if a house was a wood-frame house, it would get torn down and a 3 story house would get put in its place so a lot of minor development going on. And then about 6 years ago, the more major developments started happening, so now we’re looking at- like right behind me out this window you can see a 19 story apartment building. That was the first major structure that went up. Next door to it is a L shaped factory that I think is 6 stories high. It used to be the Somer Piano Company. And they renovated that into luxury lofts and so that was like 12 or 15 years ago and then it took a few more years but then the major development really started to happen fast so in the last 2 or 3 years, its starting to feel like you go down an avenue or a street and you’re in a canyon cause its all these tall housing buildings and I think a lot of that was- Bloomberg made that possible. There’s a lot of tax abatements. I like going to see open houses I mean if a big building’s gonna go up in my neighborhood, I want to go see what it looks like so I’ll go to open houses, just take the literature, just find out. There is nothing about any of these structures that is helping the housing crisis in the city. It’s all development for young people to share apartments with- I mean apartments, a one bedroom apartment is renting for $3500 a month! So if you’re a young married couple, you’re spending really a lot of your income on rent. And the apartments aren’t very big! So there are some condos going up but most of what’s happening in like a four block ring of this studio is rentals. High-rise rentals. I don’t know, I think it’s going to- it’s going to be a challenge for the administrators in this city to hold on to their artistic population. Cause not everybody can afford to buy a pier and turn it into an art studio and then make a 5 acre sculpture park adjacent to it. Not everybody has that level of income and ability so something’s gonna have to be thought of about how can we hold onto our artists. Especially those of us that need some square footage to make stuff in. Astoria is packed with artists right now. Some artists have studios in their apartments. I’ve seen articles in the New York Times about the block where all the stand-up comics live. The block where all the people who are in acting live. There are dance companies out here. There are cutting edge theatre companies out here, the Chocolate Factory for example, down in Long Island City. They just bought a building last year closer to me, maybe a quarter mile away- a third of a mile, something like that. They paid over a million for the building and its a raw factory, so they have to raise the money to make it into those stages that they want. But I think they’re gonna have more than one stage in there. Sheila Lewandowski is the- one of the executive directors of the company. She’s proved over and over again, what a fundraising genius she is. So they’ll make it happen. DG: So as this area has evolved, did you experience any hardships, challenges, anything that kinda affected you in a negative way, almost, that you had to overcome? KF: Yeah. I had a MeToo moment, which I’m not gonna tell the story of it because it was very personal and it was life-threatening, but I recovered and I was able to go on. But yeah it really affected, I would say, well into my thirties, so a good ten years. It was a troublesome thing. And it was just part of like part and parcel of being here. I don’t know how else to explain it but at the time, the city was very, very supportive. They had programs for things like what happened to me, and actually, that’s the thing I remember from that incident, was the kind of support services that I had. I had wonderful counselors, wonderful. Just long time support. So that was terrific. I think that the thing that happened after that event, was that I pushed myself- I was like I should really get a Masters degree at this point. I pushed myself to go into directions that would be proactive against that event. DG: Is there anything really special, interesting about this community surrounding you, anything about the local history that is notable? KF: I think the thing that’s really special about my studio building which is you know you can see its a modest structure. It’s not like a very large studio building, such as what’s down by the Long Island City Arts Center where there are hundreds of artists renting inside a building, it’s not like that at all there’s just a very small community of us. But one of the primary partners downstairs got a degree in art from Cooper Union and he developed this business with his friend, created an amazing business that supports their families but Jim (Pignetti) is a very community minded person and so he is constantly reaching out to people in the community. There’s a group of artists that come to this building because of Jim. There is a welding, they do welding in the backyard when the weather is decent and there’s a local sculptor who comes and welds frequently and his wife is a painter and she will come and work in the backyard and paint. And so there’s just this- He’s also known in the realm of poetry so there are local poets that conviene here as well. It’s his special idea about community that- you don’t want to live in isolation, you don’t want to just have your family, have your job, have your business or whatever it is and that’s your life. He’s a very more the merrier kind of person and I feel like we have known each other for a really long time now and have been in this building together for 13, or 14 years already. We’ve done projects together because I had that same kind of feeling like the more the merrier. The more people there are the more opportunities you can share, the more things you can do. And I think that that’s something special about this kind of little nook, this little neighborhood. DG: So what about your inspiration for all of this? KF: All of it comes from that time I spent as a young person growing up in a rural place. It was not at all urban. We were 10 miles from town and my parents had lived- they were raised rurally, they had lived through the depression so their mindset was, the good thing about a farm is you’re never gonna starve, you’re never gonna freeze to death because you always have the means to produce your own food, to keep your house warm and so there was this whole kind of sense of living that was all about living with the natural world. When I was a kid, it wasn’t uncommon for us to get huge snow storms, we have pictures of after the plow went out of the yard, the banks of snow are like 20 feet high. It was 30 below 0 for a week at a time. It was a tough place to live but my dad was a dairy farmer and the tradition from his family and from previous generations is that your children when they got to be 8 or 9, helped. You had chores, you took care of things. My dad always had horses my mom love riding so she had a riding horse. When I was 7 my aunt gave- there were 4 siblings in our family, gave the four of us a pony and my siblings immediately turned their back on this pony because he was starved half is life and had gotten mean. Anyway all of that is the core of what I produce. It’s about the energy of the natural world. It’s about how a person relates to the natural world, is connected to the natural world. And so the kinds of things that are present in my work all connect back through one thread of another to the natural world. Whether it’s working with the idea of the moon, this is a new moon, this is also a new moon but this one’s not done. The work is all about addressing that envelop of energy that we live in as part of earth and I wouldn’t have a clue about that if not for the way I was brought up. So that’s how the package is tied together. DG: So the sphere is very much representative of the world and the connection. KF: It does carry that connotation of the planet the roundness of the earth, but it also is about the unity of things, it is about the fact that no matter where you look at energy, the circle is the most efficient, most perfect form and so, the circle is- it conveys that quality just by its form. By what it is. And its connectivity also, and circles do that beautifully. They represent that quality of all things connected and interconnected. DG: Let’s talk about your relationship with the Queens Library. KF: Oh great! I love the Queens Library, I think libraries in general but especially the Queens Library in particular- are the epitome of our democracy. They are our democracy on its feet, in action, going forward. I have always liked the library, I think about 5 or 6 years ago, an organization in the Bronx called Lifetime Arts started to do programming for people who are 50 plus years old and I was contacted through the network that I have doing the consulting teaching I have, and asked if I wanted to be on their teaching artist roster so I said sure. I think we had to do a lesson plan or a demo or something that demonstrated our understanding of how working with elderly populations was different from working in other teaching circumstances. So I started to work with libraries outside of Queens. I went to Brooklyn, Utrecht Avenue somewhere way down in deep Brooklyn. I did some programming there, I did programming in New York, in Murray Hill, and then one day I got a call from a woman at the Queens Library, her name was Madlyn Schneider and she said, “I see you’re a teaching artist from Queens and you’re on the Lifetime Artists roster, I’d like to talk to you about doing a program with the library.” And I was like “Sure!” So we did our first program, I designed a program called Drawing to See, and it was designed especially for older participants. People who had never drawn, people who had maybe had a class or two when they were young or remembered it from school. And from there we just took off. We get along very well, there’s kind of this synergy between us and so she started to apply for grants and got a lot of funding to expand creative aging programming which is what it’s called throughout the Queens Library system I recommended a person or two that she could work with and she has done an amazing job of putting this stuff on its feet throughout libraries. Not every single library has a program but people who are really interested in the program, she makes sure they get programming. And it’s not stand-alone programming, these are like 9 sessions long, they’re 2 hours, it’s serious high-quality creative arts programming. And so I just have met amazing library managers, I met the CEO several times, he used to be the chancellor of the New York City department of education so I was very aware of who he was. What an amazing person, it’s like- it’s such a well run system. People work so hard to have the library be a place where everybody can go and find something that is for them. And I’m never not impressed with the library, never. I mean every time I do a program, I meet somebody who is doing an amazing job helping people in the libraries. I just couldn’t be happier having the kind of relationship that I have with the library. DG: So what does Queens mean to you now, after it’s changes and high-rise buildings and after you’ve seen everything compared to what it was before? KF: I think Queens is changing really fast, just like everything is changing really fast. I think New York is changing very quickly, I think that Queens continues to be a really, really dynamic place to live. Amazing people live here. People that the world will never know about, but that are amazing anyway, that have big hearts, kind hearts, all of the little neighborhoods that I have gotten to know- for example, Sunnyside. Sunnyside Gardens, that’s where my mother-in-law lives and it’s changed a lot since my husband left his family home. Since he grew up. We’re middle-aged now, so it was a long time ago but having his mother still in the house where he was born. And going back there all the time and seeing the neighbors change and leave and pass away, I just am impressed with the people of Queens. I think they’re intelligent, compassionate, good people. It doesn’t mean there aren’t some creeps in the cart, that’s the way it is all over. But I just think that people who live in Queens, they know they live in a dynamic city, but I think that they also have this feeling about this borough that it’s home. It’s the base. Home base. So I think it’s a really amazing place. I don’t know what people say that’s negative about Queens these days but I don’t feel negative things. I feel like it’s an amazing borough. I mean it’s huge. I think the stat is that it’s the most condensed place for language diversity in the nation and I think people do a terrific job at getting along with one another. One of my consultancies that’s been going on for a long time now, is I am an artist in residence and a public school in central Queens it’s about two block from the court house. And I’ve been at that school for 18 years. Unbelievably. But what i’ve seen happen in that school is there is such a diversity of kids and I remember when we started this anti-bullying program, the system embraced it. I don’t even remember what year it was, probably 2006 somewhere in there, and the school took it to heart and diversified programming around it so that kids really get that message of “you treat others the way you wanna be treated.” That’s like the golden rule at the school and everyday the kids are talking about what choice can I make to either help somebody or treat others the way I wanna be treated. And I’ve seen the school change in the last 6 years when there were kids often times in the assistant principal’s office, behavior problems, it doesn’t happen much anymore. Because they have peer mediation, they know about bullying, they’re literally taught about what is bullying and how do you prevent it, and when I see that, I just think, that’s impressive. That is impressive where you can take this broad range of a population with all kinds of different backgrounds, a lot of kids are- english is their second language, their parents came 5 years ago or whenever. They’re new arrivals, they’re new to this country and they’re doing amazing things at school that help them see we are one in this country. We have this unity. But I just I don’t go to that school every single day of the week, I go twice a week. But I just am proud of what they do there. It’s like it’s so real and it’s so important. And the news likes to say what’s bad about the department of education and we can find a lot of stuff but we can also find amazing things. DG: What was the name of that school? KF: It’s public school 99. DG: Did you have anything else you wanted to add? KF: I don’t know- I can’t think of anything right now- I mean it’s interesting to talk about all this stuff- I guess i’ve been around a lot time, that’s okay. DG: That’s wonderful, it really is. Super interesting to listen to how this community has changed, the area, it’s a shame you can’t see more like you used to. It’s still beautiful. KF: Yeah, well if you go down to the street and look down the avenue like look down Broadway, you can see across the water and if you go down 31st ave and look, you can see across the water but it’s just I guess development is inevitable. I just wish that it was more equitable because I think right now it’s not. DG: I guess that about covers it, thank you! KF: Thank you! It’s great to talk about all this stuff. ",
  "Fitzsimmons_Gerald_timecode.txt": "The interviewee in this conversation is Revend Gerald Fitzsimmons, a Montfort Missionary and the Pastor at Saint Mary Gate of Heaven. He was born on July 11th 1948, and has spent his childhood and a good amount of his adult life in Queens. Events discussed in this interview are recollections - some of his own, such as the Vietnam War and the moon landing, while others are what his parents and grandparents told him, such as the Great Depression and World War II. Fitzsimmons' grandfather immigrated to the United States in 1903 and initially settled in Brooklyn. Eventually he found his way to Queens and started his family. Fitzsimmons' recalls Ozone Park when he was growing up and compares it to today, stating that if you were to take him away from Queens when he was young and put him back today, he'd still know the difference. A unique trait he attributes to Queens is the vast diversity in the borough and his hopes for the future are that this diversity stabilizes and all these diverse people band together and make each other strong. 00:01:12 Rev. Gerald Fitzsimmons was both on july 11th 1948 in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York until he was fourteen and sent to live in a clergy house. 00:02:38 The area in which Fitzsimmons grew up in was mostly Irish and German Catholics (1950’s). The families that lived here was typically large (with many children). Fathers often worked in Manhattan while mothers took care of the children and household. 00:05:20 Fitzsimmons joined the Company of Mary, which is a religious congregation, in 1962 at the age of fourteen. He became a priest in 1975 at the age of twenty-five. He is currently a Montfort Missionary and Pastor at Saint Mary Gate of Heaven. 00:06:20 The biggest changes the Reverend witnessed during his time living in Queens was the vast diversity of immigrants that had migrated from their home countries. In the 1970’s, the vast majority of the neighborhood was Italian while those of Hispanic descent took over in the 1990’s. From 2000 onward, the neighborhood has become primarily South-Asian. 00:10:16 Before moving into the clergy house, Fitzsimmons has had many jobs as a student. He recalls a summer job at a country club where he brought home $80 (taxes withheld) weekly. He used this money to pay for his school tuition ($250/year), his sister’s high school tuition ($150/weekly) and was able to give his parents money towards the household. He enjoyed going to games at Yankee Stadium with his friends, where he was able to get a box seat for three dollars. He says Queens was a great place to grow up because “everyone knew everybody”. 00:14:55 Fitzsimmons recalls being able to use the subway for fifteen cents and getting milk and half a loaf of bread for twenty-five cents. 00:18:58 Gerald attended Public School 121 in Ozone Park for kindergarten and went to Theresa of Avila (also located in Ozone Park) up until 8th grade. For high school, he attended a boarding school for young men who aspired to become Montfort priests. 00:23:55 Fitzsimmons talks about his parents and their relation(s) to Queens. His parents attended high school during the World War II and Great Depression era(s). They were greatly affected by these unfortunate events as they were immigrants who came from poverty, worked hard, and lost it all. 00:26:33 Other than the environment changing “demographically”, Gerald explains there are now apartment buildings where trees used to be due to the population increase. 00:29:30 Gerald’s hope for the future are that this diversity stabilizes and all these diverse people band together and make each other strong. 00:34:10 Both of Gerald’s parents were born in Brooklyn. His mother went to a commercial high school in Bushwick while his father went to John Adams High School. At twenty-nine, he was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which left his crippled for the remainder of his life. His mother then became a secretary and took on the role of the head of the household. He says his parents lived “decent, honest, hardworking lives for their children”. ",

He remembers taking the �World�s Fair Super Express� Train to the fair and finding the Bell Telephone the most memorable exhibition.

The fair left a lasting impression on him and he wishes that they would bring it back to the park. 00:00:25 Begins describing the part of the Fair he founds most memorable, the Bell Telephone Exhibit. 00:02:03 he describes taking the 7 train, �the World�s Fair Super Express�, with his parents to the fair. 00:02:14* [Interrupted by students on campus asking for directions] 00:02:30 Martin returns to describing the train ride. They would play an �old-time� railroad sound to announce it. It connected to a shuttle which took you directly to the fair. 00:03:30 He went on Labor Day Sunday in 1965 which was the only time he visited the fair. He remembers the overwhelming bigness of the Fair. 00:04:30 Explains the impact the fair had on the Flushing, Queens�s community. He finds the structures that became permanent parts of the park such as the Queens Museum, the Terrace on the Park, and the NY State Pavilion. 00:05:30* I questioned him about the food that was at the fair but he didn�t really remember anything specifically. 00:06:19 Describes his memory of visiting the park after the fair in 1966 with his mother and not being able to get in because they were still dismantling the fair. He also remembers visiting the park several times by himself and going to the NY State Pavilion Museum and the scale model of the city from the fair. 00:07:44 Talks about taking a trip to the park to visit the Hall of Science for a teach-in in 1976 where he met a member of a Flushing Photography Club of which he is still a member. 00:08:31 Describes the 50th anniversary of the World�s Fair and wished they would have another fair and especially build more permanent buildings.

  "Flores_Elizabet_timecode.txt": "My name is Elizabet Flores, and my place of work is La Bomboniera Marylu. We usually are like a party planner. We can help you with the first communions, the christenings, any kind of party like birthdays, weddings, kind of thing. The thing that we do is that we help you with the invitations, favors, decoration of the hall�anything that you need for the party. Even if you just want to do a small party at your house we can just rent the chairs, tables, and make something nice at your party. And we can do a touch with a small cake if you want. We just work with the Dominican cakes. I am from Mexico. But we have a lady who makes Dominican cakes for us. And then we are working with her for seven years. And I think she makes really good, because people like a lot the Dominican cake, because around the area on 30th Avenue they just sell like Italian cake, French�so that�s the only place that I think has the Dominican cake. [The difference is] the paste. It should be like a pound cake, and the filling doesn�t have cream, it just has like a guava paste, or pineapple or strawberry or chocolate. That�s the fillings that they have there. We usually try to help them with�say if you are planning an event for a couple of months. So we say give me your idea so we can work with that. Or, �I just want to spend a certain quantity of money, I don�t want to be over�. So we just try to have everything done with the money that you have. The store has been here since 2004. So we have been here eight years. It�s a funny story. This store I think it has about two years before I get it. I was the cleaning lady of the previous owner. So she get married and she say one day I want to sell my business because I don�t want to think about it no more. So I think ok, I�ll have to look for another job. But then I was talking with a couple of friends and my family and I talked to my lady and I said �why don�t you give me the opportunity to buy your business?�. And she helps me a lot. Because I didn�t speak English at that time. She was helping me for four months, showing me. And I was trying to learn the most that I can. Because her husband bought another business in Florida. So she has to go. And I was like �oh my God I have to learn!� But what I can tell you�is I can�t believe I was just the people who helped her at her house and now I own her business. And after eight years, like once a year she calls me. �Elizabet, how�s everything, you doing good?� So I�m really happy. What I most enjoy is talking to the people. I like to be involved with every customer like my party. In that way I think they are going to be happy and they are going to come back. Because in the time that I have been here I try to keep all of my customers. So, it was a very hard time when I started, but now I can tell you but thanks God, everything is ok. I have my sister and my mom, they are the ones that are always helping me here. That�s why I like my job. I can work with them. And I can be face to face with the customers, so I can help them. If I don�t have what they want, we just ask for a little time and we try to get it. Yes, we have [a lot of suppliers]. And even if we don�t have the things, because a lot of things, especially the Spanish people, if they want something from our country, so we try to get it from Mexico and bring it here. And we learn. Because the orthodox people, for the Greek, we try to do it on Easter, we do the kind of stuff that they have for Easter, the candles and things like that. Now on Christmas for the Ecuadorian people, we try to do it because they make big parties for the holy boy. So we are involved with their traditions�they do it actually the whole month. So they do it like the party for the holy boy, and they make like invitations, they have a mass, they have a reception and the traditional dances. So we help them with that. So we learn from them and then we can help them. Just like three weeks ago we have a client, that she brings us a friend who comes from London. So she told me ok, I need this, I need that, how can I do it, because she said she has a small business like this, but over there it�s a little bit hard to get it. So we tried to help her and have everything in one week so she can go. So after she said, �ok I want to pay with my credit card�. I said �ok�, and she gave me the card and I said �ok let�s swipe it� and she said �no in London you don�t have to swipe, you just put it in front of the machine and it has a chip�. So I told her I�m not ready with that but anyway I�m going to help you. So I was doing that, and now I have it. So that is a good thing that you didn�t know before, that you did it. So every time you learn with the customers. If you learn with the first time, then the next time you know what they want, what they need, for what they use. And next time you can help somebody else. The lady who had the store before had the store for many years but it wasn�t here, it was in Roosevelt. She moved it to here. But then when she got married that�s why she didn�t want the business no more, because she had to move to Florida. I think the Bombonieras[are my favorite product in the store]. The ones that we wrap. And they are like almonds. Because that ones you can use for any occasions. So I like them�because if someone says you know what I need something�for any occasion, you know that you can just put the five almonds, that mean good luck, which I didn�t know. That�s a French, Italian and Greek tradition so I didn�t know that. So when you tell the customers, they say �you didn�t know what that means?!� That means good luck. You always have to offer five almonds in a tully wrap. You wrap in an organza, and then you print a ribbon like �happy christening�, �your wedding�, �happy anniversary��any occasion. They are my favorite favor. I have two children. You know what happened, now they have grown up they say I know this cartoon, I know that one. So it�s really difficult, because they say �oh mommy, I want this princess,� and you know you have to have everything done for your daughter. And usually when I have a party for my two kids I try to invite some of my customers so that they can take a look and see how we do it. The difficult time�sometimes if I don�t want to lose a customer and they have a party far away, that�s the difficult part. Because sometimes I have to go. So if let�s say we are here in Astoria and they want to make the party in Connecticut, I have to plan to have everything on time, I have to make the time, and don�t forget anything, because you don�t know where you�re going to find the thing you are going to. But I�ll do it. Because I know that if I do it once, they will keep coming and coming and coming. And one good customer, if you do a good job, one customer gives you another one and another one. Here in Astoria you see we have a lot of Greek people, we have Italian people, and of course the Spanish people. So we have all them�so I�ll try to do it for everyone. If I don�t understand exactly what they want I just say �can you explain again� and I�ll do it. Of course! ",

  "Fortino_Frank_timecode.txt": "(00:43) Frank discusses his experiences as a child in Calabria, Italy; coming from extreme poverty, he found life was difficult. He explains daily life in Southern Italy, and how poverty motivated his family�s decision to immigrate to the United States. (04:33) Frank�s family decided to move because they already had family in the United States. In 1952, Frank�s family began the immigration process. Ten years later, his father was approved for a visa. His sister then followed. Frank and his brother and mother finally immigrated in 1965. (06:35) Frank discusses how he felt about this transition in his life. He was fearful, but excited about this move. He recounts some of the funny and strange anecdotes that people told about life in the United States which made him nervous about the move. (08:30) Frank recalls bringing a garden hoe with him in his luggage. He brought the gardening tool over for purely personal and sentimental reasons. (09:39) Frank traveled to the United States by airplane on TWA airlines. The plane made multiple stops making the journey feel endless. The food was unappealing, but luckily his mother had made sandwiches. (11:05) Frank discusses the first few days after arrival in College Point, New York. There were no issues, as his father had already made accommodations for his family. He remembers thinking the homes looked strange, and he was shocked by the number of cars in the street. People left their doors unlocked and milk money on the stoop. He recalls how he was shocked by this practice, as in Italy they always locked up. He found American people to be very welcoming. (14:04) Frank remembers some of the cultural differences he experienced between Italy and the United States, such as teenagers having freedom to hang out on the streets. (15:13) He believes that he adopted the American way of life rather quickly. He learned English within a few months, and remembers playing stickball with children in the street. He enjoyed the amenities that Americans enjoyed, such as televisions, refrigerators, abundance of food, etc. Christmas in the United States was particularly different to him. (17:11) Frank discusses the assimilation process for him and his family members. His parents were very supportive of assimilation and learning the language despite their unwillingness to learn English. His parents never regretted their decisions to immigrate. (18:47) There were not many Italian immigrants in College Point when Frank arrived. However College Point�s small Italian community helped Frank�s family with donating clothing and finding employment. Frank�s aunt who lived in the Bronx was also very helpful. He recalls a story of having a guest in their home and how they quickly needed to adapt to American customs so as not to appear rude. Frank�s family was always willing to do things the American way. (21:36) Frank's father worked as a cook here in the United States, while his mother worked at a breadstick factory in College Point. (22:16) Frank discusses his experiences in American schools in comparison to Italian schools. Some of the most notable differences were the length of the day, the condition of the buildings, and the classroom sizes. He attended P.S. 27, and recalls Mrs. Zampetta and Mrs. Taylor who were particularly helpful with him learning English. It took him a full year to be fully fluent in English. He lost his accent within two years. (26:18) Frank's mother was extremely supportive of him getting an education. She knew that was the best way for him to succeed as an adult in the country. Frank remembers that he didn't have a difficult time assimilating. He imagines that it was a much different experience for his parents. Stickball was a gateway for Frank to be accepted with American children. (29:32) Frank remembers attending the 1964 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadow Corona Park. The fair�s sights and sounds were a surreal experience for him, as he had never seen anything like it in Italy. (31:04) Frank remembers his dislike for American food, particularly hot dogs. Italian food was abundant in Queens so he did not remember missing anything in particular. However, the diversity of food that he found in Queens was strange to him. He remembers disliking Chinese food, but grew to love it later in life. He felt American food was too heavy, and he was not fond of Italian American cuisine. (33:20) Frank believes that he has kept many of his Italian traditions, but thinks he has accepted American traditions. However, he felt many traditions were lost, as he was not near many Italians. Frank recalls always feeling like a foreigner in the United States until first visit back to Italy. It was then that he realized he truly had become American. (35:50) Frank became an American citizen as soon as he came of age in 1975. There was a yearlong wait. His true motivation for becoming an American citizen was his desire to vote and to fully become American. (37:42) Frank believe that being an immigrant has affected the person he is today. He feels like he is a bridge between two cultures. He believes that had he stayed in Italy he would be a different person today. He is thankful to his parents for making the decision to move to the United States because it provided him with the opportunity to go to college, attain a job, and learn to speak four languages. ",

Annually, the History Department at Queens College awards a prize in his name to the best example of historical writing by a student for a given academic year. 00:00:27 Arnold Franco grew up in southern end of Richmond Hill. 00:03:13 in 1933, at the age of 10, Franco grew up when America was in the midst of the depression. He remembers hearing President Roosevelt�s Fireside Chats when he announced a �Bank Holiday�. He was President all throughout his youth until he died in 1944, while Franco was in the war in France. 00:06:08 He revisited his house in Richmond and a Filipino lady now owns his house. The population has changed drastically, heavy influx of Guyanese people now. 00:08:20 He gives an annual award in History and visits Richmond Hill high annually. During his speech there he always says, �Change is supposed to be the one thing in live you can depend on� the room hasn�t changed a bit and there�s still no air conditioning.� 00:09:44 Talks about visiting the city (Manhattan), considered to be quite the trip. He talks about his first date at the age of sixteen at �Keen�s Steakhouse�. He took the subway there which was five cents at the time. In 1938, at fifteen, got a summer job in Wall Street as a �runner�, got paid five dollars a week and was able to save a dollar. *Took a break at 00:13:08* 00:13:30 Many students were taking a mixture of undergrad courses and military history due to the war. Took 32 credits in his last semester of undergrad and also worked at night at Macy�s and the Plaza Hotel. Took an exam over Christmas for two courses, passed the exam and got credit for the class. Queens College tried to be flexible because of the war. 00:15:34 Radio repair and map reading were some classes being offered at Queens College so you were preparing yourself in some way for the war. The student body was small, 400 students in each class (Pioneer class) with 1600 in total. Of that, 800-960 went into the military, that�s more than half the school. Even 60 of the women volunteered to go into the war. 00:18:50 Motto that was chanted, �From the Depression right into the war� you entered school from the Depression and left school during the war. Whether you finished school or didn�t finish school the war took you out. 00:19:48 Prof Conrad Gries who taught Ancient Greece; Hans Baron, an Ancient History Professor, and Chairman of the History Department, Carpel Pinson were influential figures for Arnold in Queens College. 00:20:02 Arnold met two young English professors during the war, Dudley Straus and another individual. He met Dudley in Code Breaking School in Washington, who was sent to Australia while he himself was sent to England. 00:22:08 Dec 7 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, President Klapper accompanied with Dean Kiely gave a speech on how America is now at war. He received a report that a German aircraft carrier spotted in Long Island and it�s not safe for 900 hundred kids to be in one place. Arnold knew that it wasn�t true; the Germans don�t even have an aircraft carrier. 00:26:24 Arnold wanted to be a History Teacher in a Public School, that�s why he was a History major with an Education minor. He had a strong negative feeling about being involved in any type of bureaucracy when he got home from the army after three years; he talked to his father and decided to go into insurance. He was getting 5220, $20 a week for 52 weeks. He went for a Master�s degree in Columbia. 00:29:41 His father had a friend who was in the insurance business. The company he was with was offering a deal for veterans wanting to go into the insurance business. They gave you an office and a desk free, no rent, free telephones (local), there were 16 brokers in this big room and two secretaries all provided free. He got his General Brokers License in June of 1946. 00:31:02 Picked up fluent German and French during the war. In his family they spoke medieval Spanish because his family was Spanish Jews who left Spain. 00:31:38 Arnold started picking up clients involved in businesses abroad like exporters. He knew the geography, what went from where to where and the steam ship lines, since during the war he was a Code Breaker. He knew all sorts of information about all sorts of things. In 2 years, he had a few dozen clients. 00:33:06 Arnold always stayed in touch with Queens College; a part of the class of 1943 Alum, and in 2006, donated $100,000 to build a World War Two Veterans Memorial on the Quad. He believes the memorial is the most important thing he has done in his life. 00:39:30 Arnold Franco Prize for Writing in History 00:43:25 Went back home to Richmond Hill after the war then moved to Fresh Meadows after getting married in 1948. 00:44:05 At 21 years old he gets a letter from his mom that she was pregnant. She was in her mid-forties. When he got home his new sister was 9 months old. 00:45:21 He met his wife through his ex-girlfriend. He asked her if she was busy on Saturday for a date, she said yes but I�m free Friday, he liked that she volunteered that information. Met her in April, engaged in September and married in December. 00:48:30 Arnold is fluent in German, French and Medieval Spanish. Army sent him to Michigan State in June 1943 to study German.

  "Freitas_Milton_timecode.txt": "“Technically they are my boss, but I like to look at them as my neighbors” Sometimes they knock on his door at three o’clock in the morning. This usually happens on Friday nights when his neighbors go out to party and forget their keys. Milton Freitas has keys, lots of them. For the past 14 years he has been the super of a Sunnyside co-op building with 51 apartments. While theoretically his work hours are from nine to five, he is on call 24 hours a day. Milton unlocks apartments, accepts packages and fixes leaky garden hoses. Most importantly, he frequently repairs the boiler and keeps the building clean. Milton is good-natured, humorous and patient. “Technically they are my boss, but I like to look at them as my neighbors. I am very lucky,” he says. His neighbors who come from Japan, Brazil, Germany, China, Belgium, the Philippines, Thailand, Indian…—the list goes on—bring him home-cooked meals and souvenirs from their travels abroad. This is good, because Milton loves to eat and to have a good chat. After having worked in his native Brazil and in Mozambique, he came to New York almost by accident. He just meant to pass a few months before starting a job in Peru, but fell in love with the city. At first he worked as a carpenter and when his friend offered him this job, he jumped at the chance. A Mormon, Milton has befriended an international community at his church in Woodside, where he spends his Sundays. Born and raised Catholic, he converted to Mormonism because the Catholic Church was never able to answer his most pressing question: “[In afterlife,] is the relationship with my mother the same I have to some Chinese guy I have never met?” The Mormon belief of his family staying close together in the afterlife appealed to him. Milton still diligently visits his family in Brazil every summer. “They hunt me down if I don’t visit my whole family,” he says, chuckling. To be close to his family, he plans to retire in Brazil. A fiend for history and mathematics who can often be seen with a book under his arm, Milton sometimes regrets not having gone to college. He always told himself “tomorrow.” “But tomorrow never came,” he says. “Here I am in the same place. If I want to move up, I have to buy the building. I have a job, but I don’t have a career.” In the podcast Milton talks about his most shocking discovery in the building on 39th Street. ",
  "Friedman_Bruce_timecode.txt": "Bruce wears many hats: Gay, Jewish, historian, and political activist to name a few. He overcame a childhood stutter to become a verbose public speaker. In his college years he cruised iconic gay bars, delved into community grassroots activism, and worked at a number of industrial companies. Over the years Bruce has collected a diverse group of friends with their own rich histories. He came to live in Queens later in life but remains a strong, opinionated leader deeply devoted in his community. 00:00:00 This is a Queens Memory Program interview with Vallaire Wallace, at the Queens Center for Gay Seniors in Jackson Heights, NY. It is Tuesday, June 26th, 2018 at 2:00 PM. This was the first Pride Parade held at the Queens Center for Gay Seniors. 00:02:56 Recalled the events of Manhattan’s Pride Celebration which took place on Sunday, June 24th. Bruce had someone record the parade in lieu of attending. Instead he went to a luncheon hosted in City Island, Bronx, and was able to recruit friends since he was wearing Pride themed jewelry. 00:03:06 Bruce was born on January 21, 1948. In his youth Bruce attended several schools in the Bronx: P.S. 28 Mount Hope and P.S. 33 Timothy Dwight School on Jerome Avenue below Fordham Road. Additionally, he attended John Peter Tetard Junior High School. He was painfully shy and used to stutter; he often had to take various routes when walking home in order to avoid being beaten up. 00:06:17 In New Hampshire, Bruce attended a small liberal arts school called Franconia College. Then he transferred to Wilmington College in Delaware (now Wilmington University). With encouragement from his straight friends he changed his behavior and became more self-confident and outgoing. While there, he came out as gay. (?) 00:07:25 In spite of his loneliness, Bruce was able to befriend a couple at Franconia College; John Saracino and his girlfriend Jill. Together they moved off campus into a house along with two other women. An incident occurred where John beat up another dude for spreading rumors about having a threesome with his roommates. Other friends in the dormitory included Robert Torrez, Michael Schuman, and Michael Schwartz. Bruce eventually became close with Michael Schuman. 00:10:00 Bruce left Wilmington College and transferred to CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Simultaneously, Bruce worked at a number of steamship companies in the 1970s, including The United States Navigation Company, Norddeutscher Lloyd (German), and Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (French). He discovered the neighborhood of Queens through cruising various gay bars, frequently traveling from the Bronx to his favorite spaces. Old haunts included The Alley, located on 37th Avenue and 75th Street in Jackson Heights and Ty’s NYC on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. 00:13:28 In 1998 Bruce celebrated his 50th birthday and invited a friend from Wilmington College to his party. 00:14:36 In 1973, Bruce graduated from CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice with a Bachelor of Arts in Government. While there he participated in the John Jay Law Club, and was the program director of the Ramón Emeterio Betances Society. Bruce took a leave of absence but returned to school in August of 1988, attending night classes. He received his Master’s Degree in Government in 1991. He also began working at the New School at this time. Bruce has been living in Briarwood, Queens since 1993. [00:19:11] [Vallarie and Bruce took a break in order to recharge the recording device.] 00:19:45 Bruce became involved in numerous organizations. In April of 1975, Bruce became involved in Congregation Beit Simchat Torah (the “Gay Synagogue”) and remained on the board for twelve years holding various positions. In August of 1997, he joined the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens (LGDCQ) at the insistence of a friend from the New School, Brad Usher. Usher persuaded him to run for Treasurer and Bruce was granted the position immediately; members of the board were impressed with his credentials. He remained Treasurer for three years. In later years he became President. Bruce was also Vice President of the Village Independent Democrats. 00:24:18 Bruce discusses his family’s history and their various opinions concerning his sexuality. Bruce is youngest of three children and is 70 years old. 00:27:10 Jimmy Van Bramer used to be the Vice President of the Queens Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens. In 2000, Van Bramer left his position after being elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention (he supported Bill Bradley). Bruce became Vice President for three years, then President for eight years until 2013. 00:30:11 The borough of Queens holds a lot of political power. Bruce is friends with Daniel Dromm, the representative of District 25. “Danny” wanted to have a club that was more inclusive and expanded the reach of the Democratic Party in Jackson Heights. The New Visions Democratic Club was founded as a result. Along with Daniel Dromm, Bruce is supporting Catalina Cruz, a Democrat running for State Assembly. They had lunch together. 00:32:29 More information regarding Bruce’s experience within the LGDCQ. While running for President, a contender was inspired to run against Bruce after watching the film Harvey Milk. It didn’t work—Bruce won the majority of the votes. Bruce also expresses surprise that District Attorney Richard Brown has sworn in the new President of the LGDCQ since its founding. Brown is not known for being “gay friendly,” but prosecuted the murderers of Julio Rivera. In 1990, Rivera was attacked by a group of skinheads in the schoolyard of P.S. 69 because he was gay. In his memory, a “Julio Rivera Corner” street sign was installed in 2000 at the southwest corner of 37th Avenue and 78th Street. 00:34:57 Winter Pride is an event held at Kettering Hall in Astoria. He went with a number of friends from the Queens Center for Gay Seniors. Bruce speaks about other projects he was involved in. 00:38:20 Activism has always been a large part of Bruce’s life, but that developed from his interest in United States History. At the age of seven he could recite all of the presidents and numerous facts about them. He always excelled in the subjects of Government, History, and English. 00:43:00 At the New School he always wanted to know what was happening, and everyone liked his personality. However the new president of the school was a “tyrant” due to his excessive downsizing. Although he wanted to stay to take advantage of the pension plan, Bruce left in February 2013. 00:49:19 Bruce recounts his time with various steamship companies in the 1970s in further detail. For example, he learned how to use a computer program called DOS (DOS, a disk operating system) when he first started working with an unnamed Russian company before abruptly quitting. 00:52:33 Bruce learned German due to his Austrian-Hungarian German background. Great Grandparents came from Berlin and Budapest. Franz Joseph I of Austria was the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Provides detail about his family relationships. 00:57:05 In August of 2016 Bruce wanted to attend a Bat Mitzvah in New Jersey for one of his nephews. Unfortunately he had an accident where he fell in his apartment. Then in Manhattan he fell in front of NYU Langone Health but wasn’t assisted because they were worried about a lawsuit. They arrived very late to the party. 01:04:05 Bruce has always been close to his sister Margot, who is five years his senior and a prolific card writer. He describes her as having a good judge of character. Bruce wanted Margot to marry a next door neighbor, a dentist named Stanford “Sandy” Israel. However it didn’t work out—Israel married another woman. His wife eventually left him for another woman. It was very scandalous. 01:11:25 Bruce continues to provide anecdotes about his family. 01:14:24 Bruce ponders how the LGBTQ community will progress going forward. He dislikes the current political environment in Washington D.C., especially the negative rhetoric regarding the transgender and immigrant communities. Attempts to cause division are unhelpful. He hopes that there will continue to be positive change in the future. ",

  "Gallegos_Catherin_timecode.txt": "00:00:28 Catherin has been living in Queens, New York for about two years. She currently resides in Ridgewood, Queens; with her parents, sister, aunt, uncle and a roommate. Upon arriving to the United States, she moved into a relative’s house. She says, “We moved to another house after some time, but we didn’t change our neighborhood”. 00:01:20 Catherine says that Ridgewood, in comparison to other parts of Queens, is a very calm and beautiful neighborhood. Catherin felt at home being surrounded by many people belonging to the same heritage as her. 00:03:10 Catherin spoke about the relationship between herself and her neighbors. She explained why she did not interact with them as much. Catherin and her neighbors worked on different schedules. 00:03:50 Catherine describes her house. She would often play with her sister in their yard and at the park close by. On weekends, that would make trips to the nearby grocery store. 00:05:40 She gets around using MTA transit. She uses both the “M” and the “E” subway line, which are both walking distance from her house. 00:06:20 Catherin attends a high school in Manhattan. Her commute to school is twenty-five minutes. She commutes uses the L subway line to get to school. She feels comforted by the massive crowds of people riding with her. 00:08:15 Catherine claims that she feels safe among the busy and active commuters also traveling with her to Manhattan during her morning commute. She 00:08:30 Catherin’s teachers advised her to get an internship in her field of study. Her internship is in Jamaica, Queens. Her teachers explained why it is important for her to leave her comfort zone. Although the majority of people living in Jamaica do not share her ethnical background, she likes this neighborhood. 00:10:50 Although she considers Jamaica a “good” neighborhood, Catherin explains that Jamaica does not give her the same sense of security she has in when traveling in other neighborhoods. On a detour from home one day, she walked eight blocks along Jamaica Avenue and 179th Street. She felt very unsafe due to the harassment from nearby men. 00:11:50 She describes Manhattan as “iconic”. She likes the tall buildings, tourist attractions, subways, and the borough’s overall atmosphere. In addition to the millions of tourists, there are many native-born New Yorkers in Manhattan that use English as their primary language to communicate. This contrasts with her neighborhood in Ridgewood, Queens, where a majority of residents are primary Spanish speaker. 00:14:00 When Catherin started high school in the United States she was placed in the 10th grade. The school she attends was created for recent immigrant students and its curriculum was formatted for new immigrant pick up the English language. She immediately noticed a difference in the education system in the United States to that of her home country. She loved the diversity and her interactions with her classmates. 00:16:25 In school, Catherin joined a club called ‘Globalkids’ where several students would gather to talk about environmental issues. 00:17:00 When President Donald Trump was elected, Catherin’s art teacher wrote a letter of concern to her Republican colleagues. In this letter, her teacher expressed concern about the new president’s nationalist views on immigration. Her art teacher was alarmed because she taught in a school where most of the students were not native born Americans. 00:20:30 Come June 2017, Catherin will travel to Washington D.C. to represent New York and the Latin community in the civic nonprofit called “Close Up”. 00:21:30 Catherin speaks about the feeling she had once Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. She explains that her school environment changed and that people were upset. One teacher was excused herself she was so ashamed. The teachers felt so strongly about this issue that they started to teach the students more than basic history. They even have migration lawyers come to school to talk about immigration laws. The students felt support from their teachers in this moment. 00:25:50 Catherin talks about her expectations for her trip to Washington D.C. in June. 00:30:50 Catherin talks about the feeling she had when she arrived to United States. She was not looking forward to it and was even it a bit traumatized by the move. 00:32:00 Catherin explains she was living in Ecuador with her mother and sister. Her father was the first one to move to the United States. 00:38:50 Catherine talks about what she does for fun. Every two weeks, she goes out with her mother and sister to an Ecuadorian restaurant. They also go shopping and just walk around the neighborhood. 00:41:00 Catherin says she misses Ecuador. She especially misses Ecuadorian food. 00:41:15 Catherin describes her relationship with her sister. 00:44:50 Catherin talks about her plans for next summer. 00:48:00 She has been learning how to live in New York City.

While she jokes “Betty is my longest relationship,” Sherry isn’t a quite what you would consider a wallflower. Energetic and endowed with a twisted sense of humor, Sherry enjoys mobilizing large crowds and getting attention far beyond her neighborhood borders. In the past the short film festival has drawn an audience of over 200 people and submissions from all over the world. The fourth edition will take place on September 25th, 2010 at Sunnyside Community Services. “We had films from Russia, England, Japan, Romania, Columbia… and Sunnyside,” Sherry said, adding that contributions included comedies, animations and documentaries of up to 25 minutes. “We are open to all cultures,” she said. “We try to stay away from violence and anything we don’t agree with [politically].” Last year Sherry and her friend Teresa Ward organized a fundraiser at Claret Wine Bar on Skillman Avenue. People played games and celebrated while helping to pay for the space rental fee, the technician who sets up the screen and projector, the photographer who documents the event, as well as flyers, programs and advertising. Among the special guests and volunteers at the film festival is Sherry’s family, who fly in from Florida for the occasion. While her sister and her niece sell candy, her mother serves as the “chief critic.” At the end of our interview, Betty reappeared from the linen closet to listen to Sherry talk about the three short films she made before the Sunnyside Shorts Film Festival started taking up all of her spare time. While I was briefly distracted by Betty’s large black spot on her otherwise white behind—“I found her in an inkwell in Sunnyside Gardens,” Sherry joked—I decided to feature this excerpt from our conversation for its humor and originality.

Pan also discussed about how her neighborhood is changing a little and how it affects everyone living there. 00:00:34 Pam will now start to discuss about growing up in her home. Pam grew up in a house that was owned. Her house was built in the 1950s. It was recently purchased when her parents bought the house. 00:01:33 the neighborhood and the people living in it was very nice. Everyone went out to play; the children played together. Everyone looked out for each other. 00:01:54 the neighbors knew each other’s name and knew if they were gone, left the house, and went on vacation. They all looked out for each other and went to school together. 00:02:30 the neighborhood was like middle class area with hard-working people. 00:02:55 Pam noticed that some of the previous neighbors moved out and new folks came in, which was one of the changes that happened in the neighborhood. 00:03:30 Pam used to take buses for Junior High School and High school. But before that, she used to go to school by walking or if someone drops her off. 00:04:15 Most of the neighbors were Catholics, but a few people like Pam’s family would be Lutherans. 00:05:00 her house that was bought by her parents in 1950s was one of the first houses that was built there. The area used to be farm area too, but most of it is houses. 00:05:55 the elementary school that Pam went before is also the same school that he daughters went to; even people from their community went there as well. 00:06:30 there wasn’t a lot of diversity in their school, but there were some. But there is more diversity today than before. 00:07:05 the education in the past was good, but Pam noticed that there were little changes happening with the education system and schools are starting to become more diverse. Pam wishes that the academic system would change for the better. 00:08:23 Pam had a really good childhood that she wouldn’t want to change anything. Pam wishes that the community would be clean, graffiti free, streets to stay in order, and stops the confrontation/fights that happen in the neighborhood. 00:10:23 Today, neighborhood wasn’t like the same as the past, but similar. The neighbors are still somewhat neighborly, not as before. 00:12:35 Pam believes that her neighborhood will become more interracial cause she saw one or two family that moved out and other people from different countries started to come into the neighborhood.

  "Giancoli_Mary_timecode.txt": "“I wanted to find out what is the root of these traditions.” When Mary Teresa Giancoli began to immerse herself into Mexican culture in New York City it was a challenge. The patrons at the small Mexican church on 14th Street celebrating the Virgin of Guadalupe were suspicious and did not want to be photographed.“I am not fluent in Spanish and I don’t look Mexican,” says Mary, who has photographed Mexican rituals for 17 years. But having had a Mexican grandfather, whom she has never met, was “a touching point” and “a mystery” that she was determined to unravel. “I really wanted to find out where the center of Mexican life is in New York and this was part of my search.” One thing Mary found at the little church was her husband, Cristian Peña, a Mexican and fellow photographer. (Cristian even appears in some of her early photographs.) Eventually the couple had iced tea after one of the events. “That was when the grand love was born,” Mary says giggling. Mary, Cristian and their seven-year-old daughter Leila now often travel to Mexico to visit remote villages where the couple documents festivities and everyday life. “I wanted to find out what is the root of these traditions,” Mary says. “What is it like in Mexico, how are they celebrated there? So there is this continual dialogue about what is happening in Mexico and what is happening in the United States. There is a lot of fusion because the traditions evolve in the United States and mix with the American traditions.” To trace Mexican customs in the U.S. back to their origins, Mary visited Mexican tortilla factories in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and tortilla makers in Cuetzalan, Mexico. Her award-winning work documents Mexican celebrations in community centers and churches in New York and in Puebla, and market scenes in Atlixco, featuring protagonists whose relatives have left to work in America. In the podcast Mary talks about the photo of the three little girls above and the origins of the traditional China Poblana costumes they are wearing. ",
  "Gifford_Catherine_timecode.txt": "Catherine Gifford is a lifelong resident of Queens. She grew up in the Rockaways before moving to Jamaica in the early 1960�s. She reflects on her family life and how living in throughout the 1930�s � 1940�s was for her and her family. 00:01:25 Catherine Gifford�s main mean of transportation was walking. 00:01:43 During the summers, her brother and his friends used Rockaway Beach as a means of making pocket money. He and his friends received change by removing cars mired in the beach sand. They would also sift for loose change using a large window screen during the wintertime. They would accumulate this change and purchase Christmas presents for their families. 00:05:13 She started taking bus and train to school when she attended high school in Ozone park. 00:06:00 She recalls how train tickets were punched as evidence that the ticket was bought before entering the train cars. 00:06:22 She attended Fordham University in Manhattan via bus and train as the main means of transportation. 00:07:40 She attended Catholic High School wearing uniforms. The school had three different uniforms. One was worn during the spring, one for the winter and a white uniform for special occasions 00:08:01 Ms. Gifford�s parents were immigrant to the United States. They had very little formal education and had only three books in the house. 00:08:43 Graduated from all girl�s high school in 1947 00:11:45 Moved from Rockaway to Jamaica in 1961 (about 55 years ago) 00:12:09 Well-built little houses have been torn down to build much larger mansions. 00:13:35 During WWII, foodstuff was rationed like butter and precious metals were scarce. While living in the Rockaways, shades were pulled down at night to prevent giving away civilian positions to enemy submarines or aircraft. 00:17:36 Civilian defense patrolmen walked around the neighborhood at night time warning people from putting their shades up. 00:18:13 She describes escalating Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the 1950�s. 00:19:25 She explains how she believes that computers and televisions have made the greatest impact since their advent in the mid-20th century. 00:20:15 Ms. Gifford lists of some of the major newspaper read in Queens: New York Times, Daily News, Long Island Press etc. (major means of communication besides the radio) 00:21:15 Here she gives some predictions for the next decade: English might not be the dominant language, New York will be more multi-cultural than it is now, people from more cultures are accepted the more than years ago, people of color will be given more respect etc. 00:23:48 She attended both the 1939 and 1964 New York World�s Fairs. She expressed her disappointment that the World�s Fair Committee did not hold another fair in New York City after 1964. She recalls learning many things, eating cuisine from other cultures, and listening to music from different countries. 00:25:32 She enjoys the ability to practice her Catholic faith without being questioned in New York City. 00:28:25 She currently lives next to a diverse community in Jamaica. 00:29:40 Ms. Gifford takes her kids to a Jewish bazaar because the wares are more affordable there. 00:31:28 Ms. Gifford traveled from the United States to Ireland via ship, a trip which took seven days. She recalls not being able to travel outside the country during World War II. 00:33:18 She discusses the building of John F Kennedy Airport which was formerly known as Idlewild Airport. The airport facilities have since expanded where no two buildings are alike. ",
  "Gilbert_Gary_timecode.txt": "Gary Paul Gilbert was born in 1958 in Lewiston, Maine. In 1990, he and his husband, Murdoch (married in 2005), moved to 8809 35th Avenue, in Jackson Heights. Gary still lives in the same building. Murdoch died in August 2017. Gary is a political activist, playing major roles in the Queens Pride Parade, the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens, the JFK Democratic Club, the Democratic Party of Queens County, and the Empire State Pride Agenda, where he and Murdoch fought for marriage equality. He currently works for NYS Assembly member Michael DenDekker. In the age of Trump, Gary thinks Queens has to show it is different from the rest of country. It is multi-cultural and people can work together. Diversity is a strength in Jackson Heights and gays are now part of the community. 00:00:26 Gary was born on 11/27/1958, in Lewiston Maine. 00:00:50 Gary met his husband, Murdoch (John Murdoch Matthew), in Bloomington Indiana. They moved to Jersey City in 1986 and lived there for four years. They moved to Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1990. They felt welcome in Queens from the start. 00:01:16 One could live in Jersey City for 30 years and always feel like an outsider. But in Jackson Heights, you could come from anywhere. The assumption was that you come from somewhere else and there were other people here like you. 00:01:55 In 1990, Gary and Murdoch settled in the same building Gary lives in now (8809 35th Avenue, Jackson Heights, 11372). Jackson Heights was much less expensive then because it still had the reputation as the cocaine capital of North America. This is because of the two airports in Queens. The neighborhood was still under a cloud. It was coming back, beginning to gentrify, but not an ideal place to live for some people. Originally, the couple looked for an apartment in Brooklyn, but it was too expensive. Some friends recommended Queens. They found an apartment with a Russian, Jewish landlord. The landlord said he was Jewish in Russia and Russian in America, always an outsider. 00:02:58 When Gary and Murdoch moved to Jackson Heights, the neighborhood had a lot of pastry shops. You could eat well here. There were a lot of good, inexpensive restaurants. When Gary�s parents visited, they said the neighborhood was like Europe � you don�t hear English a lot. You could speak any language and get by. Gary�s Mother has a French-Canadian accent and, in Queens, she did not stick out. 00:03:29 Gary came to NY to attend New York University as a graduate student, in French literature. He taught at NYU as a graduate instructor. He now works for New York State Assemblymember Michael DenDekker. He works on constituent problems, meeting with the police, and different groups. DenDekker grew up in his East Elmhurst district. He has roots in the neighborhood. (We talked about Gary�s job in more detail later in the interview.) 00:04:27 The neighborhood is becoming more expensive. Some of the shops that he and Murdoch used to like are gone. Gary likes to do business with small businesses � going to places that know him. There was an independent pharmacy, Maram Pharmacy. The owner, John Kranjac, and his wife, Adriana, were really sweet to Gary and Murdoch. The owners had to let the business go because of competition from chain stores. There is a homogenization of the neighborhood that Gary does not like. Jackson Heights now has a Starbucks. 00:05:27 Gary is seeing more people from Brooklyn - young professionals � moving into the neighborhood. Jackson Heights used to be mostly Latino. Somebody overheard someone say in a caf�, �This was a nice neighborhood before the white people moved in�. 00:06:05 In the 1990�s, when they first moved in, Gary and Murdoch met Howard Cruse, the graphic and comic artist, and his partner (husband now) Ed Sedarbaum. Howard and Ed now live in Massachusetts. Murdoch was interested in cartoons and art and he discovered that Howard lived next door, so they met Howard and Ed. They introduced Gary and Murdoch to the political scene in Queens. When there was a Democratic Party Primary, and Gary and Murdoch did not know who to vote for, they would call Ed and Howard. Ed founded QGLU (Queens Gays and Lesbians United). It was the beginning of gay activism here. 00:06:57 In Jackson Heights, at the time, people were not out of the closet to their neighbors. There were bars on Roosevelt Ave. However, because transportation was so good, people would go into Manhattan and not be gay here. 00:07:19 The bars at the time � Club Evolution is still here. Magic Touch is still here (was known as the Tragic Touch in the 1990�s). The bars were in decline when Gary came here, as the culture was disappearing and gentrification had already started. 00:07:44 Then Gary and Murdoch met Daniel Dromm, who is now a NYC Council member. Danny started the Queens Pride March, after the Julio Rivera murder. Gary remembers going to Borough Hall when Claire Shulman, Queens Borough President at the time, was making a statement about the murder. A lot of LGBT activists were there to show that the community was interested in doing something about the murder. Gary and Murdoch were following Danny, but were not really politically involved. 00:08:29 Gary and Murdoch became politically involved when they met Brendan Fay, another gay activist. They had been together 22 years, and Brendan asked them if they wanted to go to Canada to get married. Brendan was taking same-sex couples to Toronto to get married. Brendan knew a gay judge in Toronto who was marrying people for free. 00:09:15 In 2005, Gary wanted to get married in Montreal � it sounded much more fun. If you marry in Montreal, there is a 21-day waiting period. If you are coming from abroad, you can file from a distance, and then come to Montreal 21 days later and get married. That is what Gary and Murdoch did. It is a French custom. It was fun, because Gary�s family is from Quebec way back, and France before then. They were following French customs. 00:10:20 Julio Rivera�s murder was a wake-up call. Gary cannot recall if he was at the first Queens Pride March, but he attended the marches early on. They were following Danny Dromm, Howard Cruse and Ed Sedarbaum - doing what they were telling Gary and Murdoch needed to be done. There was a fear that that there would be violence. People were afraid this could ruin things for the gay community in Queens � even just coming out and marching. Activists came from Manhattan to march. But there were no problems. 00:11:19 As a result of the Queens Pride March, people began to realize that there was a high percentage of gay people in Queens. People in Queens knew about gay people, but they did not talk about it. Queens at the time was still a closet. 00:11:50 Queens was still the outer borough. Gay people had to be quiet so they didn�t ruin it for anyone. Manhattan was more organized. Now, Queens is more multi-cultural. It is the �poster borough� for the LGBT movement. There is a strong political movement here. Gary was the secretary for Queens Pride, stepping down four years ago. Now it has become �ho hum� to put on the parade. You have to deal with the issue of justifying why the gay community is still doing this. Then you find instances of discrimination and realize it is still needed. 00:13:18 In the age of Trump, Gary thinks Queens has to show it is different from the rest of country. It is multi-cultural and people can work together. Diversity is a strength here. In Jackson Heights, gays are part of the community. But just in this part of Queens, this is not the case in other parts. Gay organizations are headquartered in Jackson Heights. They could be in Forest Hills or Astoria. These are areas that seem safe, but there are other areas where a lot more work still needs to be done, like Howard Beach. 00:14: 09 The Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens (LGDCQ) is discussing the issue of working outwards in Queens, supporting groups like Out Rockaway. The LGDCQ follows Harvey Milk. If you want rights, you have to come out of the closet and tell people who you are. You can�t demand rights if nobody knows you exist. That is what Danny Dromm was following. It is the same issue in these neighborhoods. Also, the LGDQC has to deal with the reality of going into neighborhoods with large populations of people of color, as white activists. It is necessary that people within the neighborhoods organize their own people. The LGDQC could still help. 00:15:19 As an example, the LGDQC helped Council Member Daneek Miller. When Miller was running for City Council for the first time, Danny and Gary and a bunch of people went to Jamaica to collect signatures for him. Years later, Council Member Miller said the LGDCQ was the catalyst that got him started. That first week of campaigning he had doubts, then Danny Dromm came in, they all came in, and showed the campaign how to do things. They shared their skills. 00: 16:22:00 Since the marriage equality ruling in the Supreme Court, in 2015, Gary�s politics have become mainstream, working within the Democratic Party. He doesn�t necessarily see himself as doing gay activism, which is a shift. This is similar to how women�s and black studies have evolved, from looking at a particular group to studying something broader. For example, straight white men--contrary to the cultural assumption their identities need no study--also have sexual orientation, race, and gender. One can study the social construction of the straight white male. Queer studies are not just about LGBTs, race studies are not just about people of color, and gender studies are not just about women. Identity politics can be divisive if identities are solidified but productive if all identities are interrogated. 00:18:39 Gary is a member of different political organizations, including the Democratic Party of Queens County. The Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens started in a manner similar to QGLU � it was about gay issues. Danny Dromm tells the history that once the LGDCQ decided to start endorsing candidates in Queens, politicians came in and wanted your vote. Part of the agreement was the LGDCQ would go out and campaign. The LGDCQ was organizing Queens. It was a big responsibility. Most of the Clubs in Queens are tied to a specific district and members are only responsible for gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot for that area. What is exciting about the LGDCQ, for example, is Melinda Katz showing up before running for Borough President. Politicians from all over Queens came to the LGDCQ. Tony Avella came. Politicians would show up and LGDCQ members would get more of a feel for politics in Queens than members of regular democratic clubs. When the LGDCQ endorses someone, members have to be out there, knocking on doors, showing that the endorsement means something. These politicians are then good on gay issues. For example, the LGDCQ endorsed and worked for Elizabeth Crowley � she lost, but is very liberal. The LGDCQ also shows people that the LGBT community cares about other issues. Gay issues are more than sexual orientation - gay issues are about the criminal justice system, for example. When the politicians show up, Gary asks questions that are not always related to gay issues. 00:21:07 The Democratic Party of Queens County, under Congressman Crowley, has been receptive to LGBT people. It is one of the most organized Democratic Parties in the country. In Queens, there are not a lot of primaries. People agree on who will run to represent the party. People who are loyal will be rewarded. The Party is very nice to gay people - what matters is that you do a lot of work. If you do a lot of work, you will be rewarded. Congressman Crowley helped get marriage equality in 2011 in New York State. During the previous vote, there were five senators from Queens who voted against marriage equality. Congressman Crowley called a major press conference with all the elected Democrats at Borough Hall to pledge support for marriage equality. State senators who would not evolve on this issue were replaced at the ballot box, retired, or resigned. Queens has moved very fast. 00:23:48 Helen Marshall was the first Queens Borough President to invite LGBT people to an annual get together at Borough Hall. Claire Shulman, the previous President, had been quietly supportive. She never came to a Pride Parade. Helen Marshall was a Parade Marshall in the 2000�s. Helen Marshall presented Gary and Murdoch with a Borough Hall award in 2008 for their work on marriage equality. 00:24:48 Gary and Murdoch volunteered to promote marriage equality through the Empire State Pride Agenda, the biggest LGBT organization in NYS at the time. They lobbied Albany and local elected officials. They learned how to speak to elected officials, how to do the �soft sell�, they learned about advocacy. They learned how to sound positive and how to be polite. Some marriage activists were very negative, not as polished, and wanted to have a protest at the drop of a hat. That might not have been helpful, as those actions solidify positions. They did this work for four or five years. 00:26:02 Gary was a marriage ambassador. He received an award for this. As an ambassador, he worked in the community to educate people, tell them about his life and how the inability to marry has impacted him. He talked with people who might be supportive, such as neighbors, friends, members of churches, synagogues, and journalists. 00:27:00 Gary remembered doing interviews with the press about why marriage equality matters. There are at least 1,300 state laws dependent on marriage status at the state level in New York and at least 1,100 at the federal level. If a gay person was not married, they could forget these rights. 00:27:48 The Empire State Pride Agenda had a booklet on all the marriage rights and how domestic partnerships and civil unions did not provide the same number of rights and protections. The community waited for NJ to experience that. The NJ Supreme Court punted. They said same-sex couples deserve all the same rights, but the legislature could do this either through marriage or civil unions. So, they legislated a civil union, entered into exactly the same way as a marriage. But they found out it was not the same thing. Many employers and businesses did not understand it and these arrangements were not recognized by the federal government. 00:29:28 Gary was ambivalent about settling for domestic partnership at the time. It would have been helpful for older people and those who needed certain rights and benefits. But other people said not to do that � you would be giving up a lot of rights. NYS dragged its feet on marriage rights. Hiram Monserrate, a NYS Senator, pledged to vote for marriage equality and then voted against it, so the community had to unseat him. 00:30:16 Assemblymember DenDekker at the time (Gary was not yet working for him) would not complete a written questionnaire to get the LGDCQ�s endorsement. He was adamant that he didn�t want to put anything in writing, but would speak with anyone who wanted to know his positions. He did this because of the experience of Assemblymember Ivan Lafayette. He had said he did not support domestic partnership, but it was because if there was the same level of commitment, a couple should be married! This was before lot of gay activists were even fighting for domestic partnerships. What the LGDCQ learned was that a politician who is open to you and has not written anything down, might be a more solid ally than one who writes things down, but lies to you. 00:31:47 Assembly member DenDekker�s daughter is a lesbian. She is married to a woman. Gary remembers how he got DenDekker to vote for marriage equality. He asked, �Why should same-sex couples have to go to Canada to get married? When we come back to NYS, these marriages are recognized.� When DenDekker was in the Assembly, he got a few votes that way. DenDekker said NYS already has marriage equality! 00:32:37 NYS was losing money. Scott Stringer (NYC Comptroller) said he would not marry his wife in NYS until all couples, regardless of sex, could get married. He married in Connecticut and had the reception in New York. 00:33:11 Gary mentioned the importance of educating people and learning how to do sound bites for journalists. If you are at a march, and a journalist comes up to you, you need to be ready to respond, you need a sentence. At one event, a Mexican journalist interviewed Gary about marriage rights and they wrote about this in a Mexican newspaper. 00:34:12 Gary was also involved with the Funeral Consumer Alliance of Long Island and New York City. He was president for two years. The Alliance educates consumers about their rights and options. Whereas consumers today buy a lot of products online, only one in four funeral homes list their prices online. Gary got involved when he married Murdoch and they got their domestic partnership from California. He realized this was something they needed to think about. This affiliate advocated in the NYS Assembly and Senate, and they did not have a lot of people who knew how to lobby. Gary was experienced at lobbying and got involved. After he started working for the Assemblymember, he could not do the lobbying anymore. It�s about educating people. 00:35:58 Gary is a member of the Saint Mark�s Episcopal Church in Queens (in Jackson Heights). There is a lot of music there and it has become more liberal over the years. It is not as liberal as the United Church of Christ in Manhattan, where Gary went for many years (Riverside Church). When NYS legalized marriage equality, the new bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, Larry Provenzano, demanded that his clergy, who were living with same-sex partners, eventually get married. He said the same standards should apply to all clergy, regardless of gender. But this was a problem, because the U.S. did not have marriage equality everywhere. But Gary thought this was a nice story because there were a lot of traditions that prohibited any sort of marriage or recognition. Gary then talked about some other experiences at the Riverside Church. 00:38:59 The Congregation at St. Mark�s is Latino and gay and being gay is not an issue. The Church offers mostly services and music and they support a food pantry. It is a small struggling congregation. Under the current priest, Antonio Checo, they have managed to dig their way out of a mess. Ten years ago, the Bishop was thinking of closing the church because there were not many Episcopalians left in the area. But now, they get an overflow from the Roman tradition. These people are gay or, for some reason, not getting along with their tradition. At St. Mark�s, they won�t try to convert you, but they will invite you in. 00:43:27 Danny Dromm got Gary and Murdoch involved in politics. After Gary and Murdoch married, Danny wanted to give them a wedding gift. They said a gift was not important, but they did want to be involved in politics. They wanted to fight for their rights. Gary reflected that it is odd to think of your life as a political issue. It is something he still has not forgiven the US for. He and Murdoch were together for 34 years, and it was only in the last two years that the federal government recognized their relationship and they were able to file a joint income tax as married. In NYS, they were only recognized in 2011 and had to wait till the federal government recognized them as married in order to file their state income tax as married. Gary thought about the fact that after Murdoch died, for most of their relationship, they did not exist for the government. He has ambivalent feeling toward America these days, especially after Trump. There is not this level of ugliness, violence, speech, in Canada (with the possible exception of Alberta). 00:45:20 Gay political organizations have to maintain what the LGBT community has already won. Assemblymember DenDekker says that NYS has to keep doing what it has always done. NYS will not back track on issues because of pressure by the federal government. The rights of immigrants are very important. Gary reflected on the 14th Amendment which recognizes us as persons and citizens. The South African constitution tries to continually improve and correct errors to its Constitution. This is better than in the US, where people do not see the Constitution as a living document. A constitutional amendment is an �oops�. The amendment calls into question the authority of the main text. 00:47:23 Danny Dromm is very establishment now. He is progressive and works with the Democratic Party of Queens County, but can have a conflictual relationship with them sometimes. Four years ago, Danny, Jimmy Van Bramer, and Julissa Ferreras worked with Mayor De Blasio to elect Melissa Mark Viverito as Speaker of the City Council. He broke with the party to do so. Danny Dromm has an ambivalence. He first ran against Helen Sears, who was supported by the Democratic Party of Queens County, which usually backs the incumbent. That was when Bloomberg extended term limits. Danny was being told he should not run for office (2009), but he continued to do so. 00:48:52 When Danny was collecting signatures on his petitions, he had people do one signature per sheet, so if anything was wrong with a signature, the County Democrats could not throw out a whole page, he would only lose one name. He had a brilliant election lawyer. He is spending a lot of money for lawyers for his petitions, but he knows how to do it now. Gary thinks there is a trace of resentment for the days when Queens County was not as pro-LGBT as it is today. Gary is totally establishment now. He will do what Congressman Joe Crowley says. 00:50:10: The LGBT community needs to maintain what rights it has and fight for immigrant rights. Gays need to fight for the people living here without papers. Gary sees this as an equal protection issue. Gary is involved in many issues, and gay activists ask him why is he doing this. But Gary does not see these issues as opposed. Equal protection means all people should be protected. If someone else is not being protected, then his rights are at risk. 00:50:51 Gary talked about his participation in the Prison Ministry, an advocacy group at the Riverside Church. He discussed issues related to recidivism. 00:51:56 Gary talked about the prison system being a continuation of slavery. Companies use prison labor to produce products. Gary is from Maine, where prisoners have the right to vote. He thinks this is because Maine was 80% white, so people see prisoners as like them. But this is not true in NY, where prisoners are usually people of color. This is similar to the opioid crisis. It is now considered a medical problem, but that should have happened 40 years ago, when it was seen as a problem for people of color and poor people. It was criminalized. People and families were punished and sent to prisons upstate. A wife or mother had to travel upstate. Phone companies charged high rates, profiting on the prisoners. The prison system is still living out the legacy of the Civil War. 00:54:19 Gary�s hope for Queens is a more multi-cultural society. When he came back from Haiti, where he went with the Organization of American States to observe elections, and arrived at JFK Airport, he noticed everything at the airport was in English. And JFK is an international airport. In the Montreal Airport, there are signs in different languages and universal signs. The assumption here is everyone speaks English, which seems so provincial. There is a potential in Queens, which is so multi-cultural, to be more like Montreal. 00:56:09 Brendan Fay had an impact on Gary. They have different temperaments. Brendan was dealing with a lesbian couple and one died. They had trouble arranging the burial with a funeral home in Astoria (a chain based in Houston). Brendan called Gary as he knew Gary was involved with the Funeral Consumers Alliance. Brendan wanted to start a demonstration, but Gary said let�s talk this through. He called the funeral home. Gary had a good conversation with the people there. Brendan joked that Gary ruined his demonstration. Gary found the couple a less expensive funeral home. Brendan now recommends that place to his friends. Brendan can organize a demonstration in two hours! 00:58:52 Sebastian McGuire has had an impact on Gary. He is a lawyer for Danny Dromm. He and Gary worked well together. They lobbied in Albany together. Gary was polite (Doris Day type of advocate) and Sebastian was more direct. It was a good balance. 00:59:35 The gay community decided it had to un-elect Senator George Onorato, a Queens State Senator. He said he did not support marriage equality because of religion. But Gary told him marriage was a civil institution and Onorato said he would support it. But in the end, he did not support marriage equality. Onorato stepped down. Gary thinks if he had more time, he might have been able to change Onorato�s mind. 1:01:41 Marriage Equality NY went to Onorato�s office once and had cameras with them, and were very �in your face�. Gary thought that was a mistake. Another time, Marriage Equality NY organized a rally at a park in Astoria. Eight hundred people showed up to rally against Onorato. At the time, the Empire State Pride Agenda, which works inside the system, was not sure that was a good idea. But the Democrat Party of Queens County saw this and decided it was time for Onorato to go. He had been a state Senator for over 30 years. Gary reflected that different types of activism help each other. You have to think through the best thing to do. 01:03:29 Gary talked about livery cab drivers who came to the Queens office of Francisco Moya. Moya�s chief of staff told them they could have scheduled an appointment. They did not know this and with the press there, the rally looked like a declaration of war, not a negotiation. That is not always the right tactic. 01:04:40 Gary works on constituent issues. A lot of the job is getting different City agencies to work together. He attends Cabinet Meetings of Community Board 3. Giovanna Reid is the district manager. For example, if the Department of Transportation has to work with Con Ed, the problem could get lost between the two agencies. Gary will sit down with the agencies and say you all have to solve this problem. His job is to take the information from a constituent, write up the problem, and contact the agency. He encourages constituents to make a 311 complaint. Once there is a 311-tracking number, Gary�s job is to keep track of the problem. He can look it up on computer, or call the agency. People could do that for themselves, but generally, they will lose patience. 01:06:43 Years ago, when Gary and Murdoch first moved to Queens, there were a bunch of branches on the sidewalk that were never removed. They phoned Assemblymember Ivan Lafayette�s office, and in three days it was gone. This was before the 311 system which Bloomberg implemented. Before then, this sort of problem could be caught between the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). 311 does not always work. You still need to contact each agency. Queens now has neighborhood coordinating officers (NCO). The police precincts are divided into four sectors. There are two officers for each sector. When there is a problem, you contact that officer. The job of the NCO is to specialize, really get to know the person, not just respond to calls. Gary�s office can talk to the NCO. This is a return to community policing. (Gary then told a story about a complaint about cars parked in front of a driveway.) 01:09:50 Assemblymember DenDekker has a bill to make the City responsible for the maintenance of sidewalks. The Department of Parks plants trees, but if the roots are not planted deeply enough, the roots break the sidewalks and the homeowners are penalized. 01:10:55 Gary knows the pulse of the neighborhood at the micro level. Gary called the Department of Transportation to follow up on a pot hole complaint but was told he had to start over because it was a �cave in�. Gary would have to put in another online complaint about the cave in. Gary reflected that people get frustrated with government and they give up. People have to learn how to navigate the system. Often people don�t understand the differences between city, state, and federal problems. They get frustrated because they are complaining at the wrong level. 01:13:05 Gary received a Community Service Award from the 115th Precinct Community Council on 10/21/17. He walked away with citations from Congressman Crowley; State Senator Jos� Peralta; his boss, Assemblymember DenDekker; Assemblymember Moya; and Council Member Ferreras. Danny Dromm said Gary was the first openly gay person to get this award. In typically Queens fashion, Gary asked Janice Scurry, president of the Council, if it was true that he was the first out gay honoree. She thought a while and said, yes, it is, but we really did not think about it. Gary asked if that is good. He responded yes, but some education still needs to happen. It is still significant that a gay person can get this type of award. 01:15:43 Gary�s friend from Greenwich Connecticut came to the event and took a lot of photos. The friend said that he had never seen as much diversity as was in the room. People were from all backgrounds, classes, races, and sexual orientations. Gary remarked that is Queens. We take that for granted. ",

  "Glasser_Dan_timecode.txt": "http://www.sunnysidesoundproject.org/?p=150 Dan Glasser “Stray” By Sabine Heinlein “A Cadillac of a baby carriage.” “You don’t have to spend a lot of money to do something creative and make it look nice,” says Dan Glasser, co-owner of Stray, a Vintage and gift store on Skillman Avenue. When he and his wife Tara decided to open Stray three years ago, they painted diamonds on the floor, gave the store a new paint coat and focused on the originality of the items they were going to sell. Right now the couple adores vintage barware and modern Danish furniture but their taste as well as the store’s selection changes frequently. Next to clothes, jewelry, furniture, needlepoint art and vinyl, Stray sells self-made glass and mirror objects and T-shirts praising Sunnyside. (“The best neighborhood in world. Period,” Dan says.) While Stray has been received very well, the traffic on Skillman Avenue during the week leaves a lot to be desired. Dan attributes this challenge to a hesitance of investors and a negligence of storeowners who fail to put love into their business. On the weekends, however, people come from all over New York to hunt for vintage goods at the store, which has been reviewed in the New York Times, the Queens Chronicle and am New York. “You are buying something that has been owned. It has a history,” Dan says about his love for original vintage items. “That’s kind of nice.” In the podcast he talks about the couple’s “best days on the road,” their addiction to the hunt and one of their most remarkable finds: a 1958 pram in exquisite condition, “a Cadillac of a baby carriage.” ",

When I was one year old, my parents made the decision to move back to their nice apartment in Sunnyside. They wanted my sister and I to have a good New York City education. I consider myself to have spent my whole life here. I consider Sunnyside to be my personal refuge from Manhattan. Here I feel comfortable to relax in sweatpants. (I don’t have sweatpants but it’s the idea of sweatpants.) I feel safe to walk all around the neighborhood. I have a strong sense of pride for Sunnyside, but know that I am very detached from the community. I can count my Sunnyside friends on one hand. I am happy to just hang out with friends in the city and say, “Oh, I live in Sunnyside,” and smile. I don’t really have any problems with Sunnyside, except for the ‘shoebox cinema’, a certain movie theater that is as small and sticky as a gross shoebox. Its sole redeeming value is cheap tickets. But apparently the money does not go towards training people to use the projector properly. They are very ghetto but they still checked my bags for outside food that I may or may not have had. But I need the theater and so do many others.” Tristian was interviewed by Tony Rohling. ",

  "Gonzalez_Randy_timecode.txt": "Randy Gonzales, a Filipino American, has resided in Queens, New York all his life. He was born in Jamaica, Queens; where his mother worked as a registered nurse. In this interview, Mr. Gonzales talks about what it was like growing up in Jamaica, Queens during the 80’s and what sort of upbringing he had. He attended St. Nicholas and Archbishop of Molloy High School; both of which were close to his house in Jamaica, Queens. His parents were protective and would drive him everywhere. Once he learned how to use the train during his junior year of high school; he would go to the city with his friends to explore the area. He attended St. Johns College and majored in Communications. It was during his college years, that he became more curious about his parent’s background and heritage. Towards, the end of the interview, Mr. Gonzales spoke about his career path and what initially lead him to enroll in St. Johns Law School and shared a couple of his memories revolving around New York City. 00:00:51 He was born in Jamaica Hospital. 00:02:01 His very first memory of Queens was regarding his house in Jamaica, Queens. He provided details about the multi-cultural neighborhood he and his parents resided in. 00:04:17 Was not allowed to leave the house as a child because his parents were protective. His parents even drove him to school which would only take him ten minutes to walk to. However, he did not know that until later on. Overall, he lived a very safe and sheltered life in his youth. 00:05:35 Attended St. Nicholas of Tolentine (150-75 Goethals Ave. Jamaica, NY 11432) from pre-school till eight grade. 00:06:09 He was enrolled in Archbishop Molloy high school (8353 Manton St, Briarwood, NY 11435). 00:07:20 Believes his parents reason for driving him everywhere, was because they wanted his life to be comfortable. He also thinks it was because they wanted to protect him because his parents knew what they were getting by living in the bureau of New York City in the 80’s. 00:08:43 His high school would end at 2:00 o’clock rather than 3 o’clock because the surrounding high school boys would try to mess with the boys from his school. 00:10:30 shared more details regarding his experience attending ST. Nicholas. 00:14:55 He would attend events with his parents for the Pilipino Chapter of the Phil and Lions Club when he was a child. The club was his first exposure to community work. 00:16:00 Would usually spend his time with his relatives and family friends.

Although, it is unclear as to why his father moved to New York City. 00:20:07 His mother is a nurse, who was recruited to work at a hospital in Toronto.

  "Gordon_Gail_timecode.txt": "Gail Gordon discusses growing up in the Bronx and moving to Forest Hills, how the neighborhood has changed, and her involvement in the Forest Hills AIDs center beginning in the 1980�s. 00:01:54 I grew up in the Bronx. I went to high school and my first year of college there. I went to City College. 00:02:43 I moved to Forest Hills in 1978. Before that, I lived a couple other places in Queens, including Flushing. There were a lot of issues with the Forest Hills Co-ops. 00:05:18 Old buildings are coming down and bigger ones are being built. Austin Street is becoming more commercial. 00:08:20* I got involved of in the AIDS center in the early 80�s because I had friends that were gay - AIDs in Forest Hills in the early 80�s was not pretty. 00:10:50 At that time the AIDS center was mostly helping people with the end of their lives. Most of the funding came from the state and the city. 00:12:24 The leaders at the time weren�t that helpful. The only thing people related AIDS to was being gay. People weren�t as receptive to wanting to help people. Th AIDS center wanted to open in Glendale, but were told they couldn�t. 00:14:10 Queens was a smaller organization then in Manhattan. The board started to thin out, and only five board members remained due to bad leadership. The remaining board people were working all night to keep it open. Philip Glotzer revitalized the agency. There are now 4 or 5 centers in Queens. 00:17:17 The AIDS crisis at the time was considered a gay men�s disease. Over the years it changed from the gay disease to drug addicts, to anyone being able to get it. 00:19:40 Now the program isn�t helping people die but helping them live. 00:27:23 Melinda Katz and other politicians stepped up and helped the movement. 00:30:53 We had a gay doctor that volunteered with us who worked with AIDS patients at a hospital. 00:32:00* I had a friend who was just so full of life and then he was diagnosed with AIDS and he just died a few months later. 00:34:08* There were people who died at 21 or 22. It wasn�t fair it�s not like they went out knowing what was out there. But it�s not fair. It�s not like you can bring them back, all you can do is try and help. 00:43:10 I have been working on the community board for 30 years. One of the important issues we dealt with in Forest Hills was traffic control on Queens Blvd due to all the deaths and taking away parking for a bike lane. Currently a big issue in Forest Hills is the bike lanes. 00:55:30 My hope is for Queens to remain as diverse as it is. That people aren�t priced out of Queens. And that people realize that they are all the same and that they are going to work together. My hope for Queens is that it stays Queens. ",

She shares memories of celebrating holidays, such as egg hunting on Easter and the big Sunday school parties that would follow. 00:00:18: Teri, now 55, has lived in her family home on Junction Blvd. since she was four days old. The red brick home with its nice front porch and backyard has been the foundation of their family, with everyone living there at some point. 00:01:30: When she was growing up in the 1960s, her block was on the border of Jackson Heights (predominantly white) and Corona (predominantly black). She got along just fine with all of her white neighbors one street over. 00:02:30: She went to PS 49, then PS 92, and IS 145 for junior high school. Her junior high graduation was at Prospect Theatre in Flushing. She and her friends used to play across the street from home. The boys played different ball games and the girls didn�t play much, but they would have fun on the playground. Teri talks about �roofing� a Spalding ball. 00:04:00: She used to go to Max�s candy store for candy and magazines until Max sold his store to Kelly, who was much nicer. After going to Grace Episcopal Church, she would go buy candy and then hide it in the mailbox because she had a lot of cavities. 00:05:14: A milkman would come deliver milk to the metal box outside her house and pick up the empty bottles.

She also remembers seeing bagpipers and not understanding why they were wearing skirts (kilts), as well as the �It�s a Small World� pavilion, which was the best part for her. No matter how much time has passed, Teri still remembers the fair when she sees the Unisphere. She also learned to ice skate in that pavilion. 00:15:08: Teri�s family is full of diehard Mets fans, and she has many memories of the excitement associated with the games, as well as her teaching replacing the student work on the wall with a newspaper article about the Mets winning the World Series in 1969. Her father would sometimes call home and let her mother know to get the kids ready to go to Shea Stadium for a game. Even though she was not a baseball fan, Teri wanted to become a ball girl for baseball or tennis. She shares a story about seeing a celebrity tennis match with her sister when cycling at Flushing Meadows Park. 00:19:38: Teri took ballet classes at a local dance school with her sister, but her father was reluctant to sign a contract because he thought she would end up changing her mind about it, which as it turns out, was the right decision. She talks about her strict Russian dance teacher and having a ballet recital at Carnegie Hall. 00:23:28: In high school, she took photography to get out of taking woodwork and ended up enjoying it. Teri describes herself as pretty academic, while her sister was more athletic. She shares a story about pushing for her friend Grace to be the first girl to play on the boys� softball team at IS 145, which her sister later joined. 00:26:42: She went to the park on 78th street to play hopscotch because it had a permanently drawn hopscotch board. She and her friends would always be late to class after playing. 00:27:33: Teri remembers Adventurer�s Inn, a small amusement park near Whitestone or College Point, which had some rides and arcade games. You could play all the games for just one quarter, which she enjoyed more than the actual rides. Northridge Stationary is another store with games that she remembers. Teri also remembers ice cream stores such as Frozen Fantasies that had a monster shake that she saved up for. Dragon Seed was the only Chinese food restaurant she remembers from childhood, and she shares memories of that. 00:33:15: For a long time, everything was the same until new stores started coming in. She even notes that because of the lack of diversity in the 60s, a new store where Spanish was spoken was known as the �Spanish store.� There were few Spanish students and Asian students, so much so that the bilingual class was fewer than 10 students and everyone Asian was related to her friend Helen because she had a huge family. 00:39:15: Now, Teri is used to hearing lots of different languages, such as Russian and Hindi because of �Little India� in Jackson Heights. She shares a story about the one Indian boy that she remembers from her school. 00:42:45: Teri doesn�t remember ever experiencing any racial tensions while growing up because the tension at the time was between the smart kids and the less smart. 00:44:55: She went to the Greek festival in Astoria with her friend�s family and experienced the colorful surroundings and new kinds of food. 00:46:10: Teri believes the neighborhood will continue to change. Her mother was a teacher who had never seen a Hispanic PTA president, and now that is something that has happened. She thinks the population will continue to grow in diversity, but notes that the black population has greatly diminished. ",

  "Gupta_Shavetta_timecode.txt": "Shavetta grew up in India and moved to New York after getting married in 2002. She has been living with her in-laws in Astoria for twelve years, except for a two year period in which she lived in Corona due to the construction of her home in Astoria. In this interview, Shavetta discusses the changes she has experienced in life since moving from India. She reflects on meeting her husband and getting married soon after, becoming more independent by working, her children�s experiences of being Indian American, and her Hindu practices on special occasions. 00:00:14 Shavetta Gupta has been living in the United States for twelve years. She moved from India three to four months after her marriage because her husband lived in New York. She lives in Astoria with her husband and their two children, as well as her in laws. 00:01:01 She was a stay at home mom until her parents moved from India to live with her. She was able to start working at a bank because her parents could watch her kids while she worked. 00:01:18 Shavetta met her husband through family friend connections. She was excited to learn that he was from the US because she always had fantasies about living in the United States. 00:02:21 They had an arranged meeting at a park and then agreed to marry each other. Within sixteen days, they got married. 00:05:15 Moving to New York was not a great experience for Shavetta because she didn�t have a lot of good people surrounding her. She was bored a lot because she couldn�t do anything except sit around at home while her husband was at work. After she started working herself, many people noticed a huge change in her. She missed the social interactions and events that were a huge part of life in India and missing from her new life. 00:09:34: Shavetta�s husband worked at a bagel store, which was the family business. They later bought a pizza store, followed by a gas station. Due to unsuccessful business partnerships, they sold their businesses and now only own their home, which is a joint family house shared with Shavetta�s in laws. 00:11:07 In India, Shavetta�s house was also shared by her family and their spouses, but she lived out of town as she was getting her degree in accounting. 00:13:45 Shavetta did not get to know many of her neighbors because when she came to the US she could not speak to them in English, despite her English education in India. She learned by traveling alone to her appointments and becoming more independent. 00:21:28 Shavetta�s parents grew more comfortable living in the US when they found other Asian friends, although Pakistani and Nepali, that could speak their language. She considers Astoria to be a mix of people. Although mostly Italians live in her community, she sees many Asians in other parts of the neighborhood. Her children go to a Catholic school, where there are only a handful of Asian students. 00:34:40 Shavetta and her family moved to Corona when their house was under construction. She felt the presence of a social life there more than she did in Astoria. She didn�t enjoy living in the apartment building in Corona because it often had roaches and the commute was not as easy as it was in Astoria. Corona also lacked variety in shopping. 00:41:25: Shavetta�s husband took her on her first subway ride in October of 2002 to show her the Statue of Liberty, but she was in her Indian clothes and was too cold to enjoy herself. 00:42:54: She considers Astoria to be a rich class neighborhood because it is expensive to live there. When their house was under construction, Shavetta and her husband couldn�t rent an apartment in Astoria because the rent costs were too high. That�s why they lived in Corona instead. 00:51:22: Shavetta and her family don�t mind the walk to the temple in the summer, but they can�t attend as much in the colder months because it is fourteen blocks away. Compared to the temples in India, this temple is much cleaner. They also go to the temple for special occasions such as Karva Chauth, Diwali, and birthdays. Karva Chauth is a day when Hindu women fast for their husbands. On Diwali, they decorate the statues in their own home for worship, as well as having sweets and lighting diyas (clay lamps) in the home and at the temple. Shavetta goes to the temple for her husband�s and children�s birthdays, but not her own. ",
  "Gurian_Elaine_timecode.txt": "Elaine Heumann Gurian, born in 1937, lived in Jamaica Estates (1937-1941) and Forest Hills (1941-1949). In 1949, her family moved to Great Neck. She left the New York area for Boston in 1954. She is a major leader in the museum world, having served in leadership positions of major American museums. She is currently a senior advisor to museums and museum systems. Her father, Ernst Heumann, and mother, Hedi Margot Messer Heumann, were German-Jewish immigrants who came to Queens before World War II. They worked together to save family members from the Holocaust. Ernst was an owner of Trylon Reality, which built the Trylon Theater and Trylon Block in Forest Hills. He was a builder and sales agent for much of the development of Queens and Long Island before and after World War II. Elaine�s mother designed the model homes for these developments. Elaine, as a young child, tagged along with her father to many of these building projects. Elaine learned the �business of business� from her father, but he never could believe that she would be so successful because she was a woman. 00:01:33 Elaine�s father (Ernst Heumann) was born in 1900 in a small village in Germany (Gau Odernheim). The Jews had arrived there during the Spanish migration in 1492 or even prior, with the Roman army. 00: 02:35 The village was very rural with small farms. The Jews were mostly merchants. 00:03:05 The Heumann family had a small plot and grew vegetables for themselves. The father sold cows from town to town. The town was occupied by allied forces and there was real deprivation during and after the First World War. 00.03:55 Ernst Heumann left the town in 1918 and moved to Frankfurt. He lived with his grandmother and was apprenticed to a lace factory as salesman. He did not have a high school degree (Gymnasium). 00.04:56 The hand-made lace industry is destroyed by factory-made lace. Ernst is now apprenticed to a dying industry. There is destructive inflation. He is 24 years old with no future 00:05:43 Ernst leaves for America in 1924 as an adventurer. He is trained as a salesman - that is all he knows. 00:016:16 There is a dichotomy in Germany. The religious Jews are considered peasants by the urban Jews who wish to be modern. Ernst joins the BUND a left wing, hiking, anti-observant organization. To him, Judaism is a culture, not a religion. 00:07:06 Ernst comes to America as a secular Jew, very much a German Jew. 00:07:29 Ernst does not think affectionately of the Polish Jews that he finds in America. He is very conflicted about his relationship to peasants from which he comes. 00:08:01 Ernst comes to NY in 1924 with Fred Haas, a pal. They come to the U.S. to make their fortune in the land of opportunity. They room together. 00:08:39 Ernst has an opportunity to be salesmen with the Loeb Real Estate Company. The company is in Astoria. Loeb is a German Jew. Ernst�s plan is to become rich. How he does it does not matter and real estate presents that opportunity. 00:09:37 Ernst is very smart, a big risk taker, handsome, and a lady�s man. He has the opportunity to be a partner in the building industry. 00:10:02 Later, when Ernst builds the Trylon block, the funding is from her mother�s side of the family, as they are wealthier. He works very hard, has a work ethic, and believes academics are lazy. He is on a track to make money and does make money. 00:10:54 Ernst and his pals originally came to Queens because of economics. They had no money. 00:11:18 Elaine�s mother�s (Hedi Margot Messer Heumann) background was very different. Elaine�s maternal grandfather (Josef Messer) was from the Ukraine, which at the time was part of Poland. Her great-grandfather (Samuel Messer) was a Hassidic rabbi, but Josef wanted to enter the urban fabric. Josef came to the U.S. with his father Samuel Messer. The Family does not know Samuel�s history, but thinks he becomes the Rabbi in Staten Island. 00:13:02 Grandfather Josef leaves America and out-migrates to Germany and marries Elaine�s grandmother whose family migrated from Holland. He becomes a salesman of celluloid. They become middle class. Hedi is born to an urban middle-class family in Frankfurt. 00:14:28 Hedi is a Polish citizen, because at the time you did not become a German citizen just because you were born in Germany and you were given the citizenship of your father. 00:14:46 During WWI, Joseph was conscripted into the Army. He was not allowed to fight with the Germans and was shipped to the Polish army. 00:15:08 This was a huge deprivation time in German. Hedi and Hedi�s sister get rickets, as there is not enough food. At the end of the war, Joseph comes back, there is inflation, the family loses its money, and he is Polish. Hedi is now unmarriageable, even if she educated and very beautiful. 00:15:58 Hedi comes to America as an au-pair. Because she has good manners, a Gymnasium degree and is beautiful, she works in a very upper-class home � the home of the Clarence Darrow�s partner, Arthur Garfield Hayes. 00:16:34 The wife of the partner is a scarf designer. Hedi becomes a buyer for the wife. (Later she becomes the interior designer of the model homes built by Ernst.) 00:17:20 Hedi leaves this job, takes various jobs, and tries to make her way. She is not focused on making money. She is displaced by class which lasts forever. She marries down, but later her husband, Ernst, makes money and she rises to her original class which is important to her. Once married, Ernst did not allow her to work. 00:18:19 Ernst founded a German social club, primarily for �scooping chicks�. The Club had various names: German Jewish Club, New World Club, and the Blue Card. The Club published the Aufbau newspaper. The Club held parties, and Hedi, very beautiful, went to these parties. Elaine�s parents met there. (The love letters between Ernst and Hedi were donated to the Leo Baeck Institute.) 00:19:11 The couple tried to figure out a life together. Ernst loved women, a painful issue for Hedi. But she now has a better and more prosperous life. 00:20:07 Hedi is every bit as smart as Ernst. Prior to marriage, Hedi has many jobs. She invents disposable diapers which she brings to Johnson and Johnson and gets sent away. She starts a washing film negative business. She runs the stock portfolio for the family, but also cooks dinner. She volunteers for Long Island Jewish Hospital and creates a $2M card-buying business. 00:22:46 Elaine�s parents work together to save their German families from the Holocaust. They were saving both sides of the family. The super structure to do this was the already-established social clubs. The clubs become one of the infrastructures for rescuing and helping displaced German-Jews in America. Ernst is one of the founders of the Clubs. 00:24:05 Ernst is interested in expanding his English but Hedi is very isolated by language and by her husband�s refusal to let her work. According to Elaine, this is a real pity as Hedi is every bit as smart. Hedi becomes more reclusive and more frightened. 00L25:00 This is a very frightening time. No one knows if you are going to be able to save your family. 00:25:14 Ernst and Hedi to write affidavits that say they will be financially responsible for the person. (These affidavits were donated to the Leo Baeck Institute.) The affidavits also state that the person is of good character. Germany has to allow the person to leave and the anti-Jewish laws are becoming increasingly difficult. 00:26:43 The professionals in Germany get ousted from their jobs first (including two of Elaine�s intellectual uncles) so they are actually saved and come to the U.S. earlier. It is primarily the business people who were trapped in Germany. 00:27:46 Soon it gets harder to get into America. Hedi and her sister are Polish. The U.S. quota system is very anti-Polish but pro-German. The American policy is not helpful. One of the solutions is to have family come into the U.S. as visitors and start to disappear into the system � similar to today. 00:28:40 There was another strategy involving Niagara Falls. You could drive from NY to Niagara Falls and walk across the bridge, stay overnight and immigrate from Canada. 00:29:38 Hedi�s sister gets caught with an invalid visa in Niagara Falls. Luckily the Judge understands that if he sends her back, she will die. He lets her stay. 00:30:00 The refugees come in different swaths. Ernst�s parents come in the 1930�s. They live with their daughter�s family in Washington Heights. Hedi�s family comes to Queens � Astoria, Sunnyside, and Forest Hills. In the 1950�5 some to Great Neck. 00:31:07 The family came to Queens in the 1940�s because it was a different life than Manhattan. It was more family and neighborhood oriented. Kids rode bikes here. By that time, Ernst is building in Queens. 00:32:10 In 1933, Elaine�s sister is born and it is the Great Depression. Her parents are stretched thin because they were (also paying to bring the family here. These are difficult times, as her father pays the upkeep of the family during the depression. They are living in not very good, rented places in Queens. They are also crowded because different parts of the family are housed in their apartment. 00:33: 07 Elaine is born in 1937, after the worst of the depression. Now they are richer and move to Jamaica Estates and rent a house from the Trump Corporation. There is much more money. Elaine is born in Harkness Pavilion in Manhattan which is very important to her mother. 00:33:52 In 1940, before moving to Forest Hills, the family moves to Miami Beach and stays for six months. Ernst is trying to build military barracks. Because of the war, all building has stopped in Queens. The barracks project fails and the family returns in 1941 to Forest Hills. 00:34:50 Trylon Reality becomes a single-family sales operation of existing houses and remains that during the war. The Realty Company is housed in the Trylon Block on Queens Blvd. 00:35:27 Elaine�s family moved to 105-15 Queens Blvd, the Normandy, in Forest Hills. The building was surrounded by empty lots. They rented a tiny apartment. 00:36:22 The family built and owned the Trylon Block since 1939 (1/3 owner). The rental income from that block is the basis of the family income until the block is sold in the 2010�s. 00:36:40 Elaine attended PS 3 on 108th Street and PS157. Her age cohort was the forward part of the baby boom. The public-school system of Queens worked on a term A&B basis in half year cycles. The school system began, skipping children six months ahead from A to B, without any warning in order to overcome overcrowding. Hedi would not attend open school night. When children were skipped, the teachers were often angry and punitive, because the children were not prepared. 00:38:34 There were very small toilets (for babies) in PS 3 and Elaine defecated in her pants because she thought the toilet was not for that purpose. She was also very messy. Her mother took her out of kindergarten, and let he play mostly unsupervised and not go to the rest of the kindergarten year. She played with boys outside throughout her childhood. She was a tom boy, playing in the open, unbuilt areas. Hedi was an absent mother; she stays in the house. The most important person to Hedi is her sister, Gladys (Ron Cahn�s mother). The sister dies early in 1949, and Hedi is bereft forever. 00:40:33 Elaine was skipped three times and graduated high school at 16. She moved to Great Neck at age 12 and was put in remedial classes. She was learning disabled, but never diagnosed. She graduates without distinction. 00:41:40 Her father owned the Trylon Block, which included the famous Trylon Theater. Her father�s office was on that block. When the switchboard operator was off on Sunday, Hedi was the switchboard operator. Elaine attended reform Jewish Sunday school in Kew Gardens. Then she would take the subway to the Trylon Theater, get a nickel for the Trylon Soda and Ice Cream (Mr. Viukus) She was then dropped off in the movie theatre, regardless of the movie and watched the A&B movie every week. The women�s room had gorgeous lounges. The elders didn�t care if the movie was scary, Elaine stayed in the Lounge. 00:44:23 The Trylon Theater was truly an art deco theatre � but not built by father for the beauty, but because it was the fashion of the time. 00:45:26 Ernst starts building in Astoria in the 20�s and builds in the 30�s. There was a physical migration as Queens was built block by block. There was no open space left by 1949 in Forest Hills. In 1939, the World�s Fair was near Forest Hills and they build the Trylon Block. This was as far as Forest Hills had gone at the time. 00:47:35 The War ended in 1945. The GIs came home with the GI bill, and gigantic building boom begins in 1946. Building began again on the edge of Queens, and then Nassau, and then Suffolk, which were potato farms. Houses were built one field after the other. Ernst was a partner on some of those jobs. These were relatively small developments. In the 1950�s these houses were Center and Side Entrance colonials, ranch, and split-level houses. The prices ranged from $5K � $30K. They were 100% financed by VHA and FHA, with very little cash down required. Hundreds of these houses were sold every weekend. There were models and the houses sold before they are built. Trylon is the sales force for most these jobs. 00:49:45 Levittown changed the mold. It was built on an unheard-of scale, with an internal sales force. This changed her father�s business, and he again focuses on re-sales. In 1949, Elaine�s father was rich again and the family moved to Great Neck. 00:50:12 Elaine talked about being her �father�s son�. Ernst was voluble, a story teller, and liked women. Elaine would run his camera, run his movie equipment, was the side kick (1946) from the time she was nine years old until she left home at 16 years old. Ernst owned strip malls and bought Elaine things like ice cream and dolls. She went to all the building jobs on the weekends. 00:51:22 Hedi designed the interior of the model houses. There was a single row of each house that was completed (�staged�). The rest of the place was a sea of mud. The houses were built, first by a troops of carpenters, electricians, plumbers, moving from house to house. There was very high employment. One lot was built and sold after another, you could see them progress. 00:52:53 Hedi staged the houses and does the purchasing. She enjoyed this. This was her business. She saved her father money � he did not need to hire someone. 00:55:07 The Jewish builders were afraid. It was legal for areas to be restricted before the end of WWII (no Blacks, Jews, Irish, Italian, newly immigrated). Forest Hills Gardens was a restricted community, so the Jewish builders were building for themselves. They used only Jewish ancillary support (lawyers, mortgage companies, accountants, connections to bank). The Christian builders on Long Island were often not selling to Jews. The Jews were not selling to Blacks. 00:56:06 The Jewish builders existed in parallel to the Christian builders. Ernst referred to �Old Man Trump� (must mean there was a young man Trump �Donald). Elaine never heard about Donald Trump. Her father did not like Old Man Trump. 00:56:40 The family lived in rental property in Jamaica Estates in 1939. They rent from the Fred Trump Corporation. (Elaine mentions that research is needed related to what was actually restricted.) 00:57:00 Forest Hills Gardens and Cord-Meyer buildings were restricted. They were filled with people who as a child, you believe hate you. 00:58:27 in 1949, the family moves to Great Neck. They move from a small apartment to a mansion. Parts of Great Neck had formerly been restricted against Jews. Jews broke the restriction in 1949 and Great Neck becomes a majority Jewish Town. Previously, this was a community of movie stars, a Christian community of the rich. 00:59:26 Elaine was a beatnik; her father finds this terrifying. She is a tom boy. She has girl�s clothes for school, and tries to fit in, but is a total failure at this! She has been her father�s son and this is not working out. She is placed in remedial classes in great Neck because Queen�s schools of the 1949�s are not adequate. 01:00:30 When Elaine attended PS 157, this was a brand-new school. There was no library yet, and she and some of the kids in the class spent the year preparing the library, they did not go to class. She was learning disabled. 01:01:19 Great Neck was a very good school system. The children were very educated, she was failing until she caught up. But she did graduate and moved to honor�s classes. 01:01:42 She graduated without a distinguished record. Her sister did much better, but her father did not support her sister. Elaine was more supported as education was not that important to her father. Her parents didn�t attend open school night and no one diagnosed that she is struggling. 01:02:41 Elaine attended Brandeis University. It was a relatively new university at the time. She thinks she was accepted because the University knew her father was rich and hoped he would donate money. TAKE A BREAK AT THIS POINT STOP AND START THE RECORDING ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 01:04:04 Trylon Reality was located on the Trylon Block between 66th and 99th on Queens Boulevard In 1949, the family moved to Great Neck. Ernst was a syndicator at that point. He received a percentage of the real estate profits. 01:05:00 In 1954, Ernst sold his part of Trylon in Forest Hills. Trylon Great Neck opened with a new set of partners. Her father was also a partner. He did not consider leaving any of the real estate company to Elaine because she is a girl. 01:05:53 In 1956, Elaine gets married. She goes to college at 16 and gets married at 18. She is now living her life separate from her parents. They know they could not stop her. She ends the formal authority of her parents at this point. 01:07:25 Ernst now works for himself though he owns a portion of Trylon Great Neck. he builds a mote � Midway Motor Hotel in Queens, and is on the Board of Directors of Margaret Tietz Nursing Home, located on the border of Queens. He is very involved in the nursing home, due to his commitment to the German Jewish remnant -- his less fortunate pals, his age-mates. 01:09:06 Ernst is a syndicator of small parcels left in Queens and Nassau County, including small apartment buildings and strip malls. He also works in NJ and PA. None of these are giant developments. 01:09:57 Between 1949 and 1954, Ernst guesses wrong, and puts his entire fortune in jeopardy. He leverages everything (very Trump like- bets the farm and is wrong). But somehow, he pulls it off, redeems his properties and gets rich again. 01:11:05 In 1954, Elaine�s parents begin to travel around the world for three months every year on a cruise ship. This is perfect for their marriage. Her mother retreats and her father is the shuffle board champion. 01:13:02 Ernst said Elaine could be three things: a nurse, a secretary, or a teacher. She was too disorganized to be a nurse and failed at short-hand school. Being a teacher was the only possibility, but there was no teacher training at Brandeis. Turns out she loves teaching. 01:13:49 Elaine was married at 18, has two children and a husband in medical school ten years later. She realized she could not support herself which she would need to do if she got divorced (was thinking about it). She goes to night school at Boston Teacher�s College and receives her teaching degree. She is very thrilled to be there, likes learning theory, and is a gifted teacher. 01:14:54 Elaine is also an artist and she majors in art history in college. She was an ardent art history student as a child. Her intellectual aunts give her art books as gifts. 01:16:16 At age 14, Elaine went to the Museum of Modern Art, by subway, by herself. She had been traveling on the subway by herself since she was seven years old. She was terrified to go to MOMA. Her mother had sent her to an art class in Forest Hills, then sent her to MOMA for art classes by herself. She completes art work there, but at the same time her mother�s sister dies and the art work is never picked up. It is burned. 01:17:50 In 1968, Elaine lives in Boston, with two children. Her oldest becomes brain damaged by an illness and she needs to get out of the house. In 1969, the Boston Mayor (Kevin White) has mobile units placed throughout the City to keep it from rioting as it had the previous summer. She volunteers, exposing herself to the upper-class, Christian Brahmin world for the first time. She becomes the head of curriculum of the crafts mobile. 01:19:59 In 1970, the city of Boston provides the defunct Institute of Contemporary Art to open again and she is named director of education. She comes into contact with Andrew Hyde II, the new Director and a totally different world - a very well-connected Boston world. She feels like a voyeur, but they are very intrigued with Elaine because she has street savvy. They know the politics and have the money. 01:22:08 So she becomes a museum person by accident. She was doing community building. Her boss, Drew Hydem becomes head of the visitor center at Boston Children�s Museum. He stays for six months and then leaves. Elaine is in their social world and is appointed head of the public facility of the Boston Children�s Museum. It is a serendipitous, unplanned life. 01:23:48 As famous as she becomes, Elaine sees herself as a substitute for action. The museum world can listen to her and that is good enough for them, they don�t have to do anything. People come to hear her radical message, with no plans to implement it. 01:24:08 Her radical message is that museums should be truly available to real people, all the time. Museums belong to the people. What does it mean to be a free, public space, for people to do their own work? 01:25:13 Elaine�s success is beyond her own expectations. She believes she is successful because she goes to work every day and does her work. She is fascinated by �following the money�. She was her father�s son and she thinks like a boy (running meetings, spread sheets, business of business). She could go into every business meeting, and run it like a boy. She went into the construction business, a man�s field, and was the only woman. She would be tested in boy-like ways. 01:26:53 In the museum world, Elaine started as a deputy director to run the institutions, and then ran those under construction, specifically to build the infrastructure. She did this at such museums as the National Museum of the American Indian and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. She then became a consultant and works for herself. She has her own real estate business. 01:28:10 The notion that you should own your home, be an entrepreneur, and make your own money comes from Ernst. 01:28:25 Elaine very rarely comes back to Queens. But in the 1990�s, she came back to Nassau County to help Tom Suazzi deal with public space issues, specifically the public theft of Museum collections. She was hired as a consultant in the legal department. 01:29:26 She comes back every year to see the U.S. Open in Queens. She flies into LaGuardia and it feels like home. It feels surprisingly the same, because Queens had already been completely built when she left. The only changes now are when buildings are torn down and re-built. 01:31:37 We then asked Elaine if there was anything she would like to add: Ron Cahn (Elaine�s cousin) added some comments about his father, who was also in real estate, and had a different career path. His father was not a risk taker. He said Forest Hills was a nice place in which to grow up. His father did build houses, but did not have an extensive building career. We discussed interviewing Ron and his family in the future. 01:33:12 Elaine discussed how the German Jewish connection is very important to understand. The Germans carried with them the German-Jewish sense of etiquette and behavior. They were very closely tied together. When they were older and started losing people, they grew even tighter. The Polish Jews in Forest Hills were not part of Elaine�s life. 01:34:15 Elaine�s family was a German-language family, speaking �Germlish�. Her grandparents don�t speak any English, they spoke German at home. Her sister spoke fluent German. Elaine was not permitted to speak German in public, nor did her parents. They assumed people didn�t know their accent was German. When her parents spoke German to her, she had to speak English back. Her mother thought it was very dangerous to speak German on the street. When her first husband was introduced to the family, he could not understand what they were saying. This was the first time Elaine realized her family was speaking a mix of English and German. She had heard that as a single language. 01:36:39 Elaine finds it very interesting to see young Jews speaking German. (Her daughter�s children speak German. (Her daughter is Eve Gurian Wachhaus.) 01:36:56 Elaine attended different synagogues in Forest Hills as a child. She gave herself a bat-mitzvah for her 40th birthday present. Her father did not want to attend but came through coaxing. Her father came to the opening of the Boston Children�s Museum. He was very impressed and asked what Elaine had to do with this? She lost it and shouted, �it is mine�. He still could not conceive what a girl child of his would be allowed to do and what she would be able to do. 01:39:20 Her father was mystified that she was a success in business. He was not opposed, it was just inconceivable to him. 01:39:41 Ron adds a few things about Elaine�s father: He gave Ron a loan to go to college which was very kind. Ron repaid the loan and no interest was charged. Ernst was a role model in terms of his real estate and was very generous. He was the leader in terms of his commitment and success to real estate. 01:41:05 Elaine�s father was very generous to the family. He knew he had the most money and loaned his money. But it had to be repaid. He wanted people to succeed and made money available to everybody. He was the bank, but there were rules. 01:42:32 Elaine said that she operated from a political framework from the very beginning. Her father expected that if there was a new invention, the family would try it. He was a political being himself and expected Elaine to be ready at every dinner with an opinion of the political situation of the day. Her sister and mother were not included in these dinner discussions. Elaine had to listen to the news. Her father listened to the news and read the New York Times. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was her father�s big hero. When Elaine pointed out that there are obligations, (teen age idealist), his response was that when you grow up you will see the reality of the world. Elaine left home in 1954 and went to Brandeis, the most radical left-wing college at the time. At age 14, Ernst sent her to a left-wing summer camp (Bucks Rock Work Camp). When he realized that, he was sorry he had sent her. Elaine was a street organizer by 1970. Her trajectory comes from the Holocaust. Ernst said her idealized version could not be actualized. But she remains a political figure on the left wing of the museum world. She teaches that all decisions are political. She did not grow out of it. She entered the museum world as a street person, people knew that when they hired her. The museum world wants to hear what she says, but not do it. 01:48:15 End of interview. 1:25 PM August 11, 2017.

  "Hall_Raleigh_timecode.txt": "00:05:45 He has a son named Curly S. Hall. He lives in Baisley Park, Queens, right across August Martin High School, which was once Woodrow Wilson High School. They moved into this neighborhood in 1957. Before this he used to live in the �forty projects\". He was born in 1943 in the Jamaica Houses, which is now called the �forty projects.� His mother was from Richmond, Virginia. She eventually they moved her family to the Bronx. Her name was Alice Homes. His mother had a lot of relatives who pooled their money and purchased a house on 160th Street. 00:08:09 His grandmother used to do housekeeping in Richmond Hill. When Curly�s mother came of age she followed her mother�s path and also began to work in housekeeping. His mother was only payed a $1.50 a month. This made it hard for her to even get a phone because a phone would cost $1.25. His father was from Aiken, South Carolina but he was born in Jamaica, Queens on 111th avenue, and 156th street, next to Bethany Baptist Church. His grandmother moved from South Carolina to New York in hopes to build a better life for herself and her husband who was Sounen Hall. Eventually she remarried and became an advocate of Bethany Baptist church. Soon the church was rebuilt; everyone was familiar with Curly�s grandmother. Every Sunday she used to make large pots of food and put it on the church table, and everyone would come and eat. 00:10:44 His father used to iron furs, just like his mother. He worked in a big factory in Brooklyn. Eventually he started selling fur, and during that time he met people from all over. He started selling coats and pillbox hats. His father died at age fifty-five due to cancer. His death was caused by the buildup of toxic chemicals that he used as a furrier. 00:12:20 When Curly was a young boy (6 � 10 years old) and his father used to store the fur coats belonging to the neighborhood ladies for the summer. They charged the ladies five dollars storing their fur coats over the season. When summer ended they delivered fur coats back to their owners. Curly and his father collected empty bottles for recycling and collected two cents for each bottle. Curly and his father did a variety of odd jobs including delivering cigarettes to women. Curly and his father also collected, stored in their house, and sold old newspapers in bulk to the paper factory. Curly had a brother who passed away at twenty-one; before he died he taught Curly how to drum. His uncle George used to play the Bugle corps, he taught his brother how to play and his brother taught him. 00:16:50 He used to do drumming in Barneys Johnson�s dance studio, for the dance classes. He used to go there Wednesday night, every Saturday morning every Thursday morning and this lead to him becoming a really skilled drummer, and eventually he became a professional drummer, he played conga drums, African Batas, and other �drums of nature.� 00:18:58 Once, when he was 16 he and his friends were sitting in the beach, drumming, and a man named bob white; who was a Jewish orchestra leader, came to him and told him to play certain stuff, so he did and he was really good. . Every weekend he did gigs with different orchestra leaders. Drumming was a huge part of his life when he was young. 00:19:49 He and his upstairs neighbor Milford Grey, who was a year older then him, formed a Latin jazz group, they played at many events. They played a lot at Audubon ballroom, and got very popular. He played in the orchestra of white bock, a Broadway performance. 00:23:04 One night at new year�s eve his wife was sitting on the table and he was on the orchestra, and he decided he didn�t want to do this anymore, he started this due to this love for drums, and now he wasn�t having fun anymore so he decided to reduce the amount of gigs he did. He and his wife went into the post office which cutout his musical carrier because he had to work nights on weekends. 00:24:54 He went to IBM school, after that he got a job at AT&T as a key puncher soon they switched him over to their IBM department. Before he started working at the AT&T he went for an interview where he was told to come back when he had more experience. So he started working for this insurance company at the evening and the AT&T at the day time. The insurance company liked his performance and asked him to start working there at the day time and made a lot of big promises. So he quit working for the AT&T Company and started working there, after three weeks of working there they fired him for the daytime because they needed more experienced people and added two other people. 00:27:30 He had a lot of free time so he started painting his mother�s house and his friend Larry Fouse came to him and asked him to start painting with him and his father Teddy Right. So he started working there, he painted houses and apartments, etc. Painting stores started recommending him and he started painting houses here and there, where he ran into Mr. Hoka who had a general contracting business who did more than painting, he did general carpentry, etc. they worked really hard together, and eventually they started working as partners. Hoka agreed to give him 10% of whatever he made. When it got slow they both used to get small jobs. When it was time for Mr. Hoka to give him his 10%, he refused. At this point he didn�t get mad, but he understood how money can change people. 00:31:08 After this incident he headed out on his own, he called his friends to help him. He became a carpenter. He started with small jobs and progressed. He went to many classes including business class. He got involved in many organizations trying to understand business, and like this each job got bigger and bigger. The reason to his success was that he wouldn�t take to many jobs he would focus on one job. Soon they got a contract with r and s Strauss stores. He named his company RW hall general contractors ink. One night he went to a party and one of his friends (Aal Woods) from queens was there. He also worked in that store in the car department, he was a car manager. Aal Woods used to open stores, etc. He asked him if he wanted to join him in remodeling stores. So Aal called him and that was the beginning of a new carrier. He started building R and S Strauss stores all over. Everyone loved his work. Aal eventually became the CEO. 00:34:28 As business grew he did a project for �The ten year plan Koch Ed,� the company had 47 buildings to do, and he was told to bid on 16 of them. Later he got a call asking him not to bid on this project, but he did it anyway. He won 7 of the building. The union called him a threat because he wasn�t a union. Soon he was given a contract, and called in for an office meeting. Where everyone was pretty harsh, so he read the contract, at the end he didn�t sign the contract. Shortly after he got another contract, and that was pretty good but the last two pages said he could never work in New York City without their permission again, and for him to remove all her current workers etc. he declined that too, due to their condition. Eventually his company progressed a lot, and the wages prevailed too. 00:40:23 At this point he needed to get 450,000 dollar. He went to freedom national bank in Harlem and after a little while they agreed to give the money. He was told to come and collect the money in Monday, when he went to collect the check, the bank closed down, and he couldn�t get the check. After this he went to UDC and got a loan. 00:49:08 He had his first son when he started his contracting business. They wanted to buy a house so they saved as much money as he could, they barely spent anything. They bought a house eventually. Then he had two daughters. He was a part of the UNCA, where he became the vice president. He and his wife eventually made a dance group, the group performed in various places. His son was a drummer and his daughters were dancers. 00:54:04 He loved horses from a young age. When he was 9 years old his family took him to �Linn�s Riding Academy,� and he rode a horse. When he was 12 he used to go �shoe shining,� so he could earn money. Every weekend he and his friends went horse riding, and they did horse riding for a year. So he sent his kids to horseback riding camp. One of his friends called him and he went and he became a part of the horsemen. He also became an instructor for the Boy Scout. He had 54 horses and 6 died over 6 months, one died of old age another was hung up on a door and he broke his neck, and one the doctor had to kill due to pox, and another one hurt his leg and it was broken for two years eventually the doctor said he wouldn�t get better, so the doctor and to kill him. Another got hit by a car. 01:08:32 Over the years he learnt to communicate with the horses� pretty well. 01:11:56 uncle Binn is one of the oldest cowboys in the group, who passed away 3 years ago. He won the world championship �rodeo bull riding championship�. Uncle Binn lived for a long time he lived for a 100 years. (He starts showing pictures from his cowboy life and explaining it.) ",
  "Hanning_Beth_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Beth discussed about how her life was like living in Queens and also described what in Queens’s makes her feel like home. She also expresses her opinion about diversity and culture. 00:00:22 Beth Hanning has lived in Queens for 10 years. She grew up in Rockaway Beach with her family. Then she married with her husband and moved into an apartment near her house. 00:01:00 Beth knew her neighbors very well and vice versa. She knew her neighbors her whole life; they were nice folks. 00:01:22 In Beth’s neighborhood, it is majority full of whites, Irish, and Italian people who live there. But it is becoming more multi-cultural in the last 10 years; there has been more Hispanics and African-American people coming to the neighborhood. 00:02:13 the thing that is unique about Beth’s neighborhood is that the people know each other. Another unique thing is that people in the summer often ride their bikes everywhere in the summer there. 00:03:00 their property values have increased dramatically after Hurricane Sandy. Beth bought her house in 2010 and it worth twice when she paid for it in seven years. 00:04:02 Beth believes that her neighborhood was very safe. There isn’t that many good shopping mall or clothes store. 00:05:06 Beth sees that cars from Rockaway Beach going towards Queens, which causes more traffic to occur in the streets. 00:05:35 Beth goes to St. Francis DeSales to worship and it was originally her Catholic Church where she also went to Elementary School. Her Parish is very healthy when it comes to financial issues and many people whom she grew up with go there as well. 00:06:01 Beth believes that outsider sees her as a tough, intimidating, scary person, which is also how she views herself. 00:06:29 the unique areas in her neighborhood would be the beach/bay. 00:07:27 In the 90s, Beth believes that school in Queens has progressively gotten better with their educational system. 00:09:00 the most pleasant memory that Beth remembers is going to the beach. Her mother has passed away when she was 15 years old and she remembers the times when her family went to the beach. But she still goes to the beach with her friends. 00:10:12 Beth predicts that the neighborhood would become more multi-cultural in terms like new stores opening up and restaurants. ",
  "Harding_Curtis_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Curtis spoke about his life as Pastor and how his life was like as a Pastor and a resident in New York. Religion played a huge role in his life and it was what made into the man he is today. He also talked about how he grew up in New York and how things changed throughout time. Curtis also explains what influenced him to become a Pastor and how he preaches in his sermons. 00:00:33 Curtis was an associate minister/helper at the Alban EME Church. In 1983, Curtis was invited to preach. He was asked to stay for a while because the Pastor was sick. So he became the interim Pastor. 00:01:25 after 1983, the church asked him to be the permanent Pastor. So in 1984, in the month of May, Curtis was now the permanent Pastor for the St. Alban’s Baptist Church. 00:01:51 the St. Alban’s Baptist Church was formed in December 19, 1986. Reverend Dias Jones was Pastor that time. After Reverend Jones, it was Mitchell. Curtis is now the 3rd Pastor for St. Albans Baptist Church. 00:02:34 Curtis didn’t know much about Reverend Jones since he passed away by the time, Curtis joined the church. Curtis also doesn’t know his reasoning of creating the church; however, Curtis does know that Reverend Jones had a vision where people were being saved. 00:03:55 originally, majority of the neighborhood were white folks. However, some white families were moving out of St. Albans and selling their property such as the St. Albans Baptist Church. Afterwards, more black skin folks were moving into the neighborhood. Curtis grew up in Brooklyn and heard about St. Albans, but never knew where it was, but he decided to go there someday. 00:05:08 Curtis’ mother was raised in Georgia and Curtis doesn’t know when she moved to, but when she migrated, she went to Ohio. Curtis was born in Ohio and lived there for 6 months. Curtis’ childhood was full of hardship, but still had childhood like any other children. 00:07:13 Curtis’ mother was very strict like any other parent back then. In his block, Curtis and his friends knew almost everyone on the block. Curtis has a brother and sister, however, his sister has passed recently. 00:08:09 Curtis didn’t know much about his father, but he knew him. Curtis’ mother was a Baptist the same as him. 00:09:24 Curtis left Brooklyn and came to Queens in 1974. Curtis realized that people stay the same. 00:10:19 Curtis believes that there is no difference between Queens and Brooklyn. Then he realizes that there was more diversity in terms of people. He realizes that there are other languages, different types of food, music, and culture. 00:16:28 In a Catholic Church, they have a Pope, Bishop, and etc. In a Baptist Church, there is no Bishop and the Pastor is the head of the Church, who is the person who makes the decision. 00:19:09 Curtis graduated from Brooklyn High school in 1955. In 1956, Curtis decided to go to Airforce because two girls back then, whom he was interested in, told him to go. 00:21:00 when Curtis went to the Airforce, he started to notice discrimination among races. 00:24:54 Curtis married his wife in 1965, and when he married her, he worked as a conductor in New York City Transitive Authority. They met at one of the station’s platform while his wife wanted to go somewhere in the Bronx. But Curtis wanted to spend more time with her, so he misleads her to wrong direction. After 5 months, Curtis and his wife got married and have been for 53 years. 00:26:43 Curtis believes that God is Jesus, Father, and Holy Spirit. 00:31:11 when the previous pastor wasn’t feeling well before Curtis wasn’t getting better at all, the church asked if he could be the Pastor for the church. 00:32:33 when Curtis started to work as a Pastor for the church, some people didn’t like him because they miss the previous pastor before him. 00:34:00 in the church, there are more colored folks than people who came from different countries. 00:36:00 Curtis did have problems with his congregation, but he doesn’t know why. He believes that the reason why people don’t like him is because he making changes that people might not agree with. 00:38:20 Curtis shows how he starts his sermons and explains what he talks about during the sermons. Curtis wanted to help people understand that they need to be saving spiritually. 00:42:27 Curtis baptize the members every first Friday of the month. 00:46:58 Curtis accepted Jesus Christ as his savior when he was 15 years old. His brother-in-law invited him to go to church with him. When they went to church and heard a woman Pastor preached before, they decided that they should keep going to church. 00:52:42 Curtis believes that in his 34 years in preaching, he has helped some folks. There were good moments and bad moments when he became a pastor. Curtis discovered that some folks come to church because they did not want to worship God; they come to be troublemakers. 00:57:00 Curtis doesn’t think about how people view him; he only thinks about God’s words and how he interprets it. 01:00:05 back then, Curtis knew how to fight due to the people in his block who didn’t like him. 01:01:44 Curtis also read books when he was younger, especially comic books. He wished that he had kept those books since it is getting popular at this time. 01:02:38 Curtis loved his past and what has happened to him because if it wasn’t without it, he wouldn’t become the man who he is right now. He thanks God for it. 01:07:38 Curtis has 3 children and they have grown. Now, he has 2 grandchildren. One of his grandchildren’s names is Destin and Jaylyn.

  "Hardy_Claudius_timecode.txt": "Claudius Hardy is long-term resident of St. Albans and he lived there since 1960s. In the Interview, Claudius discussed about how hip-hop was an important component to his neighborhood and how there were so many diversities in his neighborhood. Claudius shared about how hip-hop music is well-known to, not only to his neighborhood, but in other boroughs as well. He shared about well-known rappers and DJs he used to listen and how it helped him and other people understand about the conflict that is happening in America. Part 1 00:00:24 Claudius Hardy had been living in St. Alban since 1960, he will be discussing about his history in the area and talk about some of the musician in the past. 00:00:44 St. Albans is an area with many different cultures, and when Claudius moved into St. Albans in 1960, at first, there weren’t that much colored races back then. However, in 1965-1970, people from the Caribbean and South America started to come to this neighborhood. 00:01:25 when hip-hop started to become well-known in St. Albans, people used to carry big boom-box until when Mayor banned loud music in the streets. However, it didn’t stop them from listening to the loud music, so they went to parks with the boom-boxes. 00:02:06 Claudius and his friends would have DJ battles in the parks. The park’s present name is Jacky Robinson Park, back then, the park was P.S. 15. 00:02:28 in the parks, people would be playing basketball, playing checkers, hanging out, and played shuffleboards. People would be dancing and gathering around when they are doing the DJ battles. 00:02:57 normally, the DJ battles would happen in the summertime when everyone would be done with school. It was a great time when other people in the neighborhood start gather around and hang out with other people; people would also dance to music. It was all about forming a community and creating togetherness. 00:03:27 in those times, there would be the young adults around there 20s and 30s that usually come around the parks. 00:03:59 they used to know non-community DJs like Kenny Spider web. He used to be WWRL, minority oriented radio station back in the 60-70s. 00:04:33 It took a while for hip-hop music started to become well-known in other boroughs like Queens. 00:05:33 Claudius lived in St. Albans since 1960s and he grew up in Ridgely, Harlem. They wanted to move to the other side of St. Albans, where one side is filled with influential/well-known people is in St. Albans and where the other side is filled with regular people. 00:06:54 His parents stayed in Harlem and some people moved out because they wanted their own personal space. He knew some relatives back in Harlem as well. 00:07:12 Claudius is more of a Queens person even though he grew up in Harlem. 00:07:29 the reason why Claudius loves St. Albans is because it is a city with diversity; it is embracing culture from other races. Everyone accepts that they are all there together. 00:08:46 hip-hop is not only just for American culture, it is for every culture. A person from other race also wants to express their opinions with music too. 00:09:03 St. Albans shows Claudius a lot of chances of what a young person should be involved with. Claudius was a boy scout, part of Glee Club 00:10:00 Claudius believes that politician, community leaders, and the people who they elect should make sure that kids are into hip-hop music and participate in activities to keep them busy. Part 2 00:00:14 Claudius is going to expand on more about the DJ Battles that he was part of at the parks 00:01:22 Claudius used to go to O’Conner Park for the DJ Battles sometimes. People would go there and play ball over there. Also, whenever there was a music that they didn’t like, they usually unplug their stereo and say that the music was bad. That is when they DJ Battles start to happen. 00:03:28 there is usually different rappers, and DJs back then that usually came to the park. There were also people who felt like they wanted to break-dance because the music that was on was pretty good. 00:06:03 most of the time, afterschool, the boys and girls usually go to the parks and they hang out there; the boys would be playing basketball or handball and the girls would be sitting on the benches talking to their friends. The park was like entertainment center for the kids. 00:06:57 Claudius listened to a lot of Try core quest, Run DMC, Public Enemy, KRS1 and etc.… People like the song because they have a connection to the song that tells people messages. The messages in the songs tell people about the problems in the neighborhood sometimes. 00:08:13 the 80’s songs gave out a message that talked about the poor condition in the neighborhood. 00:10:33 The Crack epidemic is making a bad impact to other neighborhoods, especially for the children. 00:12:11 Claudius wish that people would join a community so that people could find out that drug issue is happening and they would find a way to solve that issue together. 00:13:00 Claudius used to go to school during the Integration time, when he was in high school. That time, it helped him get to know other people and blend in with other people. 00:16:18 Claudius remember some memories when he went to Martin Van Burren High school. He remembers when he was in photography class, and he remembers one girl and one other guy used to take pictures of the city for class. One day, they went to a semi-rich neighborhood and they went to take pictures of the place. The other guy and the girl went out to take pictures and Claudius went out later. Then after when he was taking pictures, security guards saw him. Claudius got scared at first and told them that he was with them. 00:18:30 Claudius went to I.S. 59 for Junior High School. 00:22:47 each neighborhood is diverse with other races. St. Albans is one of those places that show that diversity. Claudius lives in the side of St. Albans where regular people live in. ",

  "Harris_Warren_timecode.txt": "“When I was a kid I always thought that Bliss was the happiness and joy you’d experience from going to a movie.” Warren G. Harris has been interested in movies and cinemas for almost as long as he can remember. The author of nine critically acclaimed biographies of some of Hollywood’s most famous stars, Warren began his immersion in the subject in the Sunnyside Theater at the tender age of five. When his grandmother took him to see a movie starring ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy, Warren got lost in the movies—quite literally. “In the midst of the movie I had to go to the bathroom. Coming back into the auditorium, I got lost,” he reminisced one recent afternoon as we sat in the movie section of the Sunnyside library. “It was so huge, I didn’t know where I was at. An usher came over and held his flashlight over my head and walked me up and down the aisle until my grandmother spotted me.” Warren’s fascination for the world of films continued unabated. He read his grandmother’s movie star magazines and, as “a walking encyclopedia,” he provided information on movies for the children in his neighborhood. He lectured on the history of movies in high school—“The teacher gave me such a dirty look”—and wrote a report on a book that was made into a movie. (“She thought that was awful also.”) While in college he worked as an usher at Jamaica’s Valencia Theater, and later became a publicist for Paramount. Eventually he began writing biographies, most notably about HYPERLINK \"http://www.amazon.com/Sophia-Loren-Biography-Warren-Harris/dp/0684802732/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275835515&sr=8-20\" Sophia Loren, HYPERLINK \"http://www.amazon.com/CARY-GRANT-ELEGANCE-WARREN-HARRIS/dp/0747402027/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275835515&sr=8-31\" Cary Grant, HYPERLINK \"http://www.amazon.com/GABLE-LOMBARD-BIOGRAPHY-WARREN-HARRIS~1974/dp/B0011TV58A/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275835429&sr=8-6\" Clark Gable and Carol Lombard, HYPERLINK \"http://www.amazon.com/Audrey-Hepburn-Biography-Warren-Harris/dp/0786108215/ref=sr_1_25?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275835515&sr=8-25\" Audrey Hepburn and other stars. Today Warren contributes the results of his ongoing research to HYPERLINK \"http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6175/\" cinematreasures.com. With its 2,000 seats, its crystal chandeliers and an interior architecture reminiscent of the Renaissance, the Sunnyside Theater was magnificent. Opened in 1926 in what has now become Rite Aid’s parking lot on Roosevelt Avenue and 52nd Street, it was demolished in 1960 to make space for an A&P Supermarket. Now the only reminder of the site’s glamorous past is the seven-foot pitch of the parking lot: the upward slope from the theater’s stage to the seats in the last row. In the 1940s Sunnyside, once a major shopping hub that attracted people from all over Queens, had four movie theaters operating concurrently. Seedy Center Cinemas on Queens Boulevard is the only one that has survived. Each of the four Sunnyside theaters had its specialty: Center Cinemas was the first one in Queens to show exclusively foreign movies; Sunnyside Theater featured Vaudeville acts, dance teams, acrobats and even basketball teams to lure visitors to movies that may have not been that good; 43rd Street Theater, which still stands on Greenpoint Avenue, showed movies after they stopped playing in other theaters, giving visitors an opportunity to catch up on what they might have missed; and Bliss Theater on Greenpoint Avenue and 46th Street distinguished itself with its Egyptian-style interior architecture and its “magnascopic screen,” a screen that expanded for special effect. “When I was a kid I always thought that Bliss was the happiness and joy you’d experience from going to a movie,” Warren remembers. Later he learned that the cinema was named after the Bliss family, who was instrumental in settling the area. The Bliss Theater building, which still flaunts 2,000 seats, a stage and balconies, was bought by the Jehova’s Witnesses in the 1970s. They painted over the splendid Egyptian-style murals that featured nudity with a demure landscape perhaps more fitting for the theater’s new function. The glorious days of movie theaters—fittingly referred to as palaces—are long past, and today Warren rarely goes to the movies. Instead he rents old movies at the library. Multiplexes are “like shoeboxes divided into nine sections,” he says. “One of the enjoyments of seeing a movie is about seeing it with a lot of people, hearing and seeing the reactions of the people around you. If you go into those little theaters you don’t have that.” In the podcast Warren talks about his first experiences in Sunnyside’s movie theaters in the 1940s. ",

The owners of the factories were Korean but they spoke Spanish perfectly. For that reason I never learned English. They were good. With one of them I was working more than nine years. But that one he got tired of living here and went to his country. He sold the factory to another person. The other owner, well, I didn�t like much the work that they did. So I decided to change profession. I had a daughter, took some vacation time and then got work in a Laundromat. There they taught me for ten months. I didn�t like it either. The managers, I didn�t like how they were. It was good work and everything, because it was big. I decided to ask for work here because I live here, on 35th Street. I had always come here to wash my clothes since I lived her, for 18 years. But till then it had never struck me to ask for work here. Now I live five minutes from work. I work five days � in the afternoons on the weekdays and in the mornings on Saturday and Sunday. I like the customers who come, they are very friendly. We chat with people. You don�t get bored. We have quite a lot of work but I like it. I only have one sister and distant family in Mexico still. We are six brothers and sisters, and five of us live here. And my parents are here. In the 21 years since I came I have only been back to Mexico two times. All my family is here. We go on vacation near here. When I came, I lived three years in Manhattan, I got married and came to live here in Astoria. There weren�t so many businesses then. I lived on Crescent but in a very small apartment. I got this one and loved it � I�ve been there 18 years. The caf�s and everything, it�s not much time that they�ve been open. It�s nice because in the summer it�s full of people. In the nighttime here you don�t need to worry about anything. We close at midnight and there are things open, people and everything.

I want to study culinary arts. To be a chef. Ideally Mexican and Italian food. I don�t really want to set up my own restaurant � that�s hard to manage. Martha: Everyone round here knows my daughter.

However, her parents resided in Woodside, Queens and that is where she was raised until either 1984 or 1985. In this interview, she speaks in great length as to how the neighborhood in 70th street of Roosevelt Avenue was like during the 80’s. The family moved to Briarwood, Queens on either 1984 or 1985; when she was still in third grade because they felt that Woodside was not as safe as it used to be. It was during her high school years, that she started to explore Filipino as an identity and as a culture. Over the years, she attended many Filipino events and functions. Nonetheless, it was her friend Aristotle who introduced her to Filipino literature and arts; which became a turning point for her because it made her view another aspect of her culture that she did not know existed. She joined the archipelago and native souls group during her college years. 00:00:55 she was born in Manhattan, but raised in Queens. 00:01:38 one of her earliest memory of Queens was, riding the seven train with her father while living in Jackson Heights around either 1978 or 1979. 00:04:14 the first home she and her parents lived in Queens, was located in 73rd street. 00:04:50 the children would play and go house hopping because everyone knew each other in 70th street. Moreover, everyone always had someone who would babysit the children in her neighborhood. 00:06:05 the 70th street neighborhood already had a Filipino community and the Phil and Lions? also resided in the corner of 70th and Roosevelt Avenue. 00:07:52 she would play freeze tag and ride around the block.

She never knew anyone before when she went there. 00:18:00 her first impression when she met her husband back then at the party 00:19:04 her first date with her husband was a White Castle on Queens Blvd. They met at May 21, at the party and they got married in June 7 at City Hall, Chinatown. 00:20:35 after the nursing party, she was selling property in Pocono. 00:22:00 her husband took her to a playboy club in queens Blvd. as one of the dates, but she didn’t want to go there so they went to White Castle instead. 00:22:55 Aida and her husband had their wedding in Jackson Heights, St. Marries. They had potluck during her Wedding day. 00:23:55 Aida left Philippines because she wanted to help her family and her friends were leaving. She worked at the “Evening News Newspaper”. 00:26:29 her main point of leaving was for her family, her father was chemist and her mother was businesswoman who sold jewelry. 00:27:10 some of her friends were leaving because it was hard for them. 00:27:25 Aida left at 1970, her plane was leaving around 4 o’clock; she left without letting her parents know until she got on the plane. 00:28:07 going back to the reason why her friends left due to some difficult times. During the time when Marshall Law happened that was when the difficult times start to happen. 00:29:25 Students at her university, University Belt, was badly beaten due to riots and rallies. Some people were molested. There were buses on fire where the students were still in there. Aida joined a rally back then for a funeral for like 2-3 people, which died from police brutality. 00:32:29 Aida believed that there was like no freedom of speech over there. The movement of Catapudin was affecting Queens during the 1970-1980 mostly near St. Sebastian. 00:36:46 Aida was really supportive with the Catapudin movement with her restaurant. Aida opened a catering restaurant when both she and her husband were out of jobs. They lost their jobs because they sacrificed themselves for other people. 00:39:08 Aida and her husband got married in St. Maries in September 21 in 1974. 00:41:25 Aida started Catering after she got married. When they were both out of jobs, her husband took a part-time job at the gas station before and Aida would cook for the employees at the gasoline station on Queens Blvd. 00:43:45 Her Brother-in-law from Paris came and when he heard that Aida was doing the Catering business, he wanted to it too. 00:44:58 at her small restaurant, Aida had a lot of good memories over there. They would get customers from upstate NY because her food was really good. Aida had to cook for conferences in 1986. Her restaurant was open in 1978 and closed at 1981. 00:51:47 Aida remembers Flushing Meadows, and the parades that they have in Flushing. 00:52:40 Aida used make her daughter, Erna Barenio Hernandez, join plays and skits. 00:53:00 Aida used to live in Woodside when she opened the restaurant. 00:54:26 Aida used to also live nearby the restaurant and the neighborhood knew them and they had a good time over there until the changes started to happen and people from before started to leave and new people came in and lost their identity and people didn’t know each other that much. 00:57:30 Aida was active in different churches in Queens. Aida’s first Prayer group was Mercy Prayer Group in Elmhurst. The prayer group will help other communities around the neighborhood. 01:03:35 Aida met Redal’s mom through in one of the Filipino stores and through church. 01:04:21 Aida first church community that she joined was St. Sebastian. 01:05:45 Aida used to go to church during Christmas times. 01:07:40 Aida used did Christmas Caroling; she went to house to house and ask for money. Aida was also a Choir member in the Philippines. It was hard to ask for money. They went house to house all the way up to Connecticut and New Jersey. 01:16:08 in the neighborhood that Aida and her daughter, Erna Barenio Hernandez, lived, it feels like you are family even though they aren’t technically family. 01:16:37 Aida feels like raising her kids in New York feels different than her own childhood in Philippines. 01:17:37 Aida moved out Woodside for safety reasons. She also wanted to live in a house, not in an apartment. 01:18:10 Aida wanted to do catering than doing the restaurant because the restaurant business started to more expensive, so she closed it after 3 years. 01:19:35 Aida’s next career move after the restaurant business was babysitting. 01:20:00 the reason why Aida was able to afford to buy a house in the Philippines is because she took care of a lot of kids, that is when she was able to make a lot of money. 01:22:04 Aida and Erna Barenio Hernandez, her daughter, met Hillary Clinton in a fundraiser. They met a lot of famous people during her Aida’s career as a babysitter. 01:23:50 Aida transitioned from being a restaurant owner to a babysitter because of money. Actually, after her restaurant business, Aida worked as an assistant accountant and also worked at Marylid for a year. 01:29:00 the thing that keeps her in Queens is her connections with the neighborhood and the people. While staying Queens, Aida believes that it changed her standard of living for the better. 01:32:59 the community used to be a lot closer in Woodside; they treated other neighbors like family. Aida had a lot of good memories in Woodside. 01:34:40 In the Filipino’s gathering, Aida and Erna Barenio Hernandez, used to go to Cunningham Park a lot of barbecue and picnics. They were invited to go to those gatherings with them. 01:36:10 Wolworth is a place where Aida and Erna Barenio Hernandez liked to go to. They sold school supplies; make up kits and clothes. 02:07:20 the words for Filipinos from Aida is that they are here for a better life, and it feels different at first. Aida wants to go back to the Philippines with her families. ",

  "Hiraldo_Carlos_timecode.txt": "My name is Carlos Manuel Hiraldo and we are in Astoria, 30th Drive, our apartment. I�m a college Professor at La Guardia Community College which is a part of CUNY. I teach English literature which for all practical purposes means composition, freshman composition. I also teach the novel sometimes, a course called writing through literature. I sometimes teach a poetry course. My students are of all ages and they are from all over the world. La Guardia calls itself the world�s community college. Slogans are slogans but it�s true to some extent. The most satisfying aspect is seeing the improvements, seeing students becoming better as writers, and becoming interested, wanting to take a literature course or course in a particular kind of writing. The most challenging part is the students who don�t make the breakthroughs! Those whose writing doesn�t get better�and the students who take an elective literature course but are not really interested in it. It�s difficult because you don�t want to ignore the students who aren�t making significant progress, but you also don�t want to just focus on them because that brings down the class as well. So it�s a hard balancing act. It�s hard to admit as an educator in this country that not every student is going to learn and not every student is going to pass, because the rhetoric is that everybody can learn and do well. Obviously that�s just not true. I was born in upper Manhattan, in Washington heights, in Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in the maternity ward called Sloan Hospital for Women. The first four years when my parents were together we lived on a very quiet block on 171st street. I remember green trees. For some reason I don�t remember winters during the first few years of my life. I remember running with my sister because the hospital was nearby and it had ramps outside. We would run up the ramps and call it �el peligro�, frightened that the security guards would shoot us if we ran up the ramp outside. We had very vivid imaginations. I guess my mom said at some point �no corre por all� porque es un peligro� and so we started calling it �el peligro.� My mother worked in a factory all her life- Alexandra�s doll company. It was a luxury doll company where the doll probably cost more than she made in one day. That was on 135th Street. My father was a cab driver. He picked me up from school at 3pm every day for lunch. That was weird because it meant I ate lunch late around 3 then I would eat dinner at 6 or 7. Sometimes I would also eat lunch in school because I couldn�t wait. I was always praised at high school for being a good writer. I remember when I went back to teach at my high school for one year, my history teacher told me that he still had some of my essays. At first I wanted to be a journalist, to do a communications major. Then I realized you had to be too diplomatic. I realized I just didn�t have the personality to be a communications major. Now I think I could do it but at the time I couldn�t. I was also shy, very inward. And you have to make connections as a journalist. My English professor told me to be an English professor because it still involves writing. Usually my writing is about identity. Whether race, class etc. What is your identity first and foremost, how you deal with it, and how do you let it be a positive rather than a negative. Often identity can be negative. And if people believe the wrong things about what they�re supposed to be, that�s negative. So if people believe that being Latino or being black is being uneducated, then that�s an identity that�s harming you. So it�s teaching people to be flexible about their identity. The poems I write are confessional but I try to make them objective, or at least relatable. Too much poetry can be people just regurgitating their lives and putting in verse a kind of diary. Those are my worst poems, the ones that make me shiver. I don�t have a method. They just come to be from my life, from feeling something strongly, you know. Last year I wrote about travelling a lot. 75% of travelling I don�t like. There�s a 25% jewel in it that�s great but I don�t like the actual process of travelling and I don�t like most of the way I feel before and afterwards � the stress of preparing and then trying to come back to some kind of normality. Our families are spread outside of NYC. My wife�s English, so we have relatives in England, Miami/San Francisco / Dominican Republic. There are probably more people living here who weren�t born here than were born here. I think that immigrants from abroad invest more in the city than internal immigrants from other parts of the country. Immigrants from abroad whether they are Latinos, Asians, Latin Americans etc. they come here and set up a life here. Internal immigrants whether they come from the Midwest or wherever, they often see the city more with utilitarian purposes. Immigrants from abroad and native new Yorkers have a thing in common � they see it as home. I think immigrants internally see it in utilitarian terms. Like �I want to be an actor so I come to New York to be an actor�, or �I want to be in finance so I come to New York to be in finance�. And they often have an exit strategy. I�m not saying that immigrants from abroad or people born here won�t leave � they might � but while they are here they already have an exit strategy, it�s a stepping stone. The attachment is dispassionate when you were born here. Internal immigrants have to go everywhere and see everywhere while they are here, see all the new places and the hip places because they know that they will be here only a certain amount of time. Native New Yorkers don�t get so frenzied about it. I moved to Astoria in November 2009. My wife and I were expecting a child. She was looking for places in Brooklyn that have certain characteristics � enough space and also an ambience, so you can do things in the neighborhood. I was living in Sunnyside at the time which is close to my work. So I thought of Astoria � prices are reasonable and there�s a lot to do in the neighborhood. Washington Heights there wasn�t that much to do around the area. Unless you were dealing drugs, or, you were very Dominican � born in the DR or your parents were. In the 70s, 80,s., 90s, even today. Even though its gentrified now there are still very few options in Washington Heights itself unless you�re a Dominican immigrant or a criminal (not the same thing even though some people might like to think that!). There is Cougans where a lot of whites hang out and sort of American-born Dominicans or those who have been here a long time. Sunnyside was somewhere between Washington Heights and Astoria in that respect. It did have some bars to go to but again they have much more of a neighborhood feel. If you have not grown up in the neighborhood even if you were born in New York, you don�t necessarily feel comfortable in those places. I think there are more places in Astoria that are more inviting to all kinds. You see people who you think have probably grown up in the neighborhood and then you see people who have just been here a few years like us. Some neighborhoods are the other extreme. Like in Brooklyn they feel all new. They�ve changed so radically that while you have a small sense of what used to be it�s hardly there. Whereas Astoria is still in flux. The landscape is in flux and that kind of saddens me. The architecture is not pretty. I think it�s never been pretty this mix of weird houses that look different and then bigger buildings. Now you get more for sale signs on the small houses and that�s sad, you don�t know what�s going to happen. If possible I�d like to see that mix of old and new in the people but the old in the buildings! I don�t think the whole city should look like Manhattan. There�s a great bakery where they make the best chocolate croissants I�ve ever, ever tasted � Frank�s Bakery on 30th Ave. I like Athens caf� and a couple of the restaurants. It would be good if there were more small bodegas, small grocery stores. You have supermarkets, and you have magazine stores, but few stores that sell food in case you forget something you can quickly go in. Growing up in the 70s and 80s in New York City I had a tough time growing up. I don�t think you can always say that New York is a great environment to raise a kid unless you�re super rich. The schools is one thing, and just the environment. Even the best neighborhoods like this one have elements you don�t want associated with your kid. My kid is very young now so Astoria�s fine but I don�t know if it always will be. ",

  "Hirshon_Elliot_timecode.txt": "Elliot Hirshon grew up in North Merrick in [Nassau County] and moved to [Forest Hills] in 1977. He married Irene Jedrlinic in 1983. He remains a resident of the area, living in the house that he and his wife bought and renovated in 1986. In this interview he describes his life in the Colorado Apartment Building and his role in opposing the owners� move to convert the rentals to coops. He describes the businesses, restaurants, and recreation facilities of the neighborhood and how they have changed, or in some cases, remained the same. He reflects on his exciting visit to the 1964-1965 New York World�s Fairs in [Flushing Meadows-Corona Park] when he was a teenager, traveling to Queens from Long Island. The interview touches on his family�s connection to Manhattan and the experience of living with elements of both an urban and a suburban lifestyle. Most important to Mr. Hirshon is his description of his marriage and family and his pride in having raised his son in a home filled with love, by two parents who fit each other like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Intro 00:40 Mr. Hirshon explains that his son, Nicholas, introduced him to the Queens Memory Project. After his wife�s death, Mr. Hirshon and his son found items in the house that reflected Queens� history and this prompted Nicholas to contact the Memory Project. 1:56.73 Describes watching a TV show that broadcast wrestling from the [Sunnyside Garden Arena] in Queens. He was a child living in Long Island at the time and he recalls this as a special time shared with his father, when he was able to stay up later than usual, he recalls memorable wrestlers Haystacks Calhoun, and Masked Marvel. (Interviewer note: Mr. Hirshon struggles in the interview to name a wrestler whose name he says is similar to �Ricky Martin.� Following the interview, he remembered the wrestler was named Ricki Starr.) 6:33 Begins to describe his move to Queens as a young adult after completing college. He had been commuting to work in Rego Park, Queens, and school in Manhattan from his home in North Merrick, Long Island, and found the commute too long and difficult. 7:18 Describes the routes of the E and F trains at the time and the commute. 7:48 Worked at the Social Security Administration office in [Rego Park], where he met his wife who was a lifelong Queens resident. 8:34 Began exploring the neighborhoods of Queens and found Forest Hills to appear to be a �nice,� �middle-class� community. Moved to [Forest Hills] in 1977. 9:09 Moved to [67-12 Yellowstone Boulevard] in Forest Hills. Describes the housing stock of apartment buildings built around WWII. 9:30* Describes the Colorado Apartment Building where he lived, near the 67th Avenue subway stop. 10:05* Discusses the subway lines and the fact that the routes have changed. Explains that the route lines used to have double letters, e.g., NN, RR, GG. 10:30 Neighborhood composition: Many tenants were in their 50s to 60s and retired. Mr. Hirshon thinks they may have lived there for most of their adult lives. Residents took car service or buses to travel locally and subway to Manhattan. 11:19 Mr. Hirshon had a studio apartment when he got married. He and his wife moved to a larger apartment in the same building. 11:27* Mr. Hirshon proudly describes his wife�s ability to negotiate with the landlord for a larger apartment and a parking space. 12:18 Describes moving into their larger apartment which had been occupied by the prior tenant for many years, the floor was �black� from dirt and there was an infestation of roaches. The landlord needed to do some cleaning prior to their moving in. 13:06 Within a year or two of their moving to the larger apartment they learned that the owners were planning to have the building �go co-op.� 13:16 �Almost nobody� who was renting there wanted to buy an apartment because the building was not well maintained; he describes the conditions and the fact that the tenants often called the city to complain. This was approximately 1984. Began working with the tenants association, which was led by a nice but disorganized elderly woman. The building was seven stories high with approximately twenty apartments on each floor. Younger people in the building started working together to oppose the proposed conversion plan. 16:32* The tenants group banded together to hire an attorney and an engineer, there was a divide between the older and newer tenants, and the newer and younger tenants hired an attorney. 17:57* The landlord may have recruited the leader of the older tenants group �to be a spy.� �And we were warned to be careful.� As soon as this group saw a weakness in our attorney their group walked out. The younger group started interviewing new attorneys and engineers and compiled information about the building deficiencies. 19:31 The tenant group was able to delay the plans for the coop conversion but was not able to prevent it. The landlord never negotiated with the tenants beyond the minimum that the �attorney general forced them to do.� The only options were to remain as a renter (and forgo any upgrades to the apartment), or leave, if you were unwilling to purchase a coop. Renters were able to terminate their lease without penalty but were not offered incentives to move. 21:45* The landlord may have been related to the LeFraks and may have had some connection to the Trump family. 22:10 The Hirshons purchased and moved to a house in Forest Hills. �Way on the other side of Queens Boulevard,� bordering Forest Park. He continues his discussion of the old neighborhood near the Colorado Apartments. 22:40* The former movie theater (Trylon Theater on Queens Boulevard) which is now a Ukrainian Jewish theatre, the (Midway Theater on Queens Boulevard) now has nine screens and formerly had five, another theater is now a Duane Reade. Two theatres on Austin street have been converted � one to a children�s clinic (formerly Brandon Cinemas) and the other is now, possibly, a NY Sports Club. The neighborhood originally had a predominantly Eastern European Jewish population. There were numerous Jewish delis on Queens Boulevard and Continental Avenue; none exist now in Forest Hills. The rental building always had a transient population that changed over time to �Oriental� groups, Indian groups, Russians. The new Russians are different from the older group. Both are Jewish but the earlier group was more likely from Poland and Austria and the newer Russians are more Eastern/Asian/Ukrainian. This led to a change in the types of food and services available in the area; Supermarkets changed, Dunkin Donuts was a �coffee shop�, fast-food restaurants took over, [Hollywood Lanes] bowling alley closed, Some fruit markets are the same, but still have �candy stores� that sell newspapers and candy like the old days. 27:15 Mr. Hirshon explains that he doesn�t miss much of the old neighborhood but highlights a few shops and restaurants he remembers. 27:33* [Sandy�s Surf] was a very good Jewish deli, [Mayhew�s] on Continental Avenue was also good, but is now gone, [UJ�s] on Continental Avenue had garage doors on the front, all these were replaced by chain restaurants. There was also the [Empire Store] on Austin Street - 2 stories. He goes onto mention a family-owned kitchenware store called the [Happy Cooker]. The [Irish Cottage Pub] is one of the few that remains from the old days. Woolworth�s is now Boston Market. 31:04* Went to a Mexican restaurant where Tito Puente played. That and other restaurants have changed ownership. 31:29* The local Italian restaurant, Buonavia and La Stella (sp?) were owned by Lidia of the famous restaurant family. (Interviewer note: This refers to Lidia Bastianich. The second restaurant was named Villa Seconda.) 32:30* Mr. Hirshon shares another anecdote about the co-op conversion at the Colorado Apartments. Mr. Hirshon and his wife began seeing people come to the building to explore the option of buying an apartment. The official co-op offering had not yet been made public. The building had a widespread roach infestation. Mr. Hirshon killed a large specimen and glued it to the wall adjacent to the door way of the sales office. It remained there for several weeks. 34:56 He reflects on the apartment and explains that fixing up their rundown apartment provided the skills and experience they needed when the purchased a �fixer-upper.� Their new home was a 2 story with an attic. They added an attic floor, outdoor lighting, removed old wallpaper. They hired people to redo the floors and he and his wife handled painting and wallpaper. They renovated the kitchen with paint and new appliances. Over time they hired contractors for larger renovations they could not afford initially. 36:55 The neighborhood composition: A small block, dead end, bounded by Metropolitan Avenue and Forest Park. Many neighbors were much older. The Hirshons were in their 30s. Next door was a couple in their 60s who lived in the house since it was built in the 1930s. The other next door neighbors were a young couple with young twin children. Other residents of the block included other older couples whose children were grown and a few young couples. Few stores. 38:26* An ice cream shop from the 1920s remains there. It is adjacent to the Cinemark movie theater. It is called Eddie�s Sweet Shop. They have homemade ice cream and whipped cream. The old �Our Gang� comedies were filmed there and currently the TV show Blue Bloods sometimes films there. 40:31 Business on Metropolitan Avenue at that time � mainly �back office� � not retail for the public; Lawyers, insurance agents, etc., very few restaurants. There was a drug store and two card shops � �Dolly� and �Fantasia�. Later others moved in - Pet stores, vet, hobby shop, wine shop. Not much to look at when walking with the baby stroller. Forest Park near them led to the bridle path - not suitable for pedestrian strolling. The small playground was poorly maintained - soiled by dogs, equipment in poor repair. Neighborhood was and still feels safe, quiet suburban feel. Parking remains at a premium if you are not using the driveway. The homes are built with the driveway away from the doorway to the house. 44:53 Mr. Hirshon describes his trip to the 1964-1965 New York World�s Fairs in what is now Flushing Meadows Park. He was in his early teens (age 11 or 12) and living in North Merrick, Long Island. His father was not interested in attending this fair as he thought nothing could beat the 1939 World�s Fair. Elliot and his friends decided to visit, using the LIRR, to the Flushing line. He thinks the trip might have been subsidized by the Merrick News. (Interviewer�s note: The Merrick News was a newspaper that Mr. Hirshon and his brother Arnold started out of their home at 2006 Brian Drive with other children from the neighborhood.) They visited two or three times with �brownie cameras.� He remembers the GM exhibit - Futurama, Hall of the Presidents. It�s a Small World (sponsored by Coke or Pepsi). Ford exhibit � life through the ages with home/family tableaus. The current Hall of Science was an exhibit sponsored by another nation, possibly Jordan. Belgian waffles � thick waffle with ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries. The foreign pavilions� �we were fascinated by meeting foreign people.� 48:25 Explored his connection to Manhattan. When very young, he would visit his mother�s parents in Manhattan. He remembers hearing the �toots of the ferry boats� from their apartment. 50:20 He and his brother would set up a table in front of the house to sell lemonade, toys, books, and coins. They wanted to save their money to buy tickets to see The Music Man on Broadway. They were inspired to do this after hearing the song �76 Trombones.� The family bought four tickets and went to a Wednesday matinee to see his first Broadway show. Robert Preston was performing. His father loved it - the musical techniques and performances, his father was a Juilliard-trained musician. After they had dinner at Tad�s Steak House. �That was our adventure.� First adventure in Manhattan. Also remembers seeing a TV show when they received free tickets, and attended a game show with host Jack Nars, called Dotto. His mother was invited to return as a guest but the quiz show scandals broke the following week and the show went off the air. 54:55* Explains that his father would not go into Manhattan if he didn�t have to (awkward). Often said that �the Indians got the better deal�� when they sold the island for $24. His mother was not adventurous and preferred staying home. His father hated going to �the city.� 56:21 Explored role of religion in his upbringing - he explains it was not important but that they �had to be bar mitzvahed.� While living in North Merrick, they attended a conservative temple that required a long walk to attend. The family did not attend Saturday services because his father�s business was open on Saturdays. He discusses attending Hebrew school and later studying the Bible in college. He did not have any connection to connection to religion in later life, his wife was Catholic and so is their son. 1:01:00 Starting to close the interview. Asked why he has chosen to remain in Queens, what makes it a place where he has chosen to live - Convenient to roads and highways to L.I., and convenient to public transportation to Manhattan for work. It is in between suburban life and very urban life in Manhattan (*1:02). At night there are fewer crowds than Manhattan but more lively than Nassau or Suffolk counties. He prefers local hardware store to Home Depot. He and his wife liked access to Manhattan � museums, Broadway shows. Never afraid to ride the subway; raised their son that way. Liked to explore other cities and countries during vacations, and liked exploring other people and foods. 1:04:00 In closing Mr. Hirshon reflects that what is most important to him is his marriage and family. He describes his wife and their marriage as �very, very special.� They fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and his son added a piece to the puzzle. He shares a story that illustrates for him his wife�s spirit and the melding of all of their interests into a special family. �There was love in that house�� ",
  "Hirshon_Nick_timecode.txt": "Nicholas (Nick) Hirshon was born in Forest Hills and lived there until the summer of 2013, when he moved to start a Ph.D. program in mass communication at Ohio University. He remains very connected to the area, frequently visiting his father Elliot, who lives in the home where Nick was raised. In this interview, Nick describes his area as “about the best you could have,” providing the best of city living without the challenges of Manhattan. He describes neighborhood attractions and architecture. Nick is himself a historian with a rich knowledge of Queens (he wrote the 2013 book “Images of America: Forest Hills”) and the interview is enriched as he shares this in the context of his memories. He describes the emotional experience of attending the first professional sports event in New York City after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. He also relates a dramatic story of robbers entering his home and threatening Nick and his father at gunpoint. Despite this, his Forest Hills home remains the place to which he hopes to return to live. 38:00 Nick explains that he is a historian who trained to conduct oral histories in his Ph.D. program. He has conducted many interviews and now hopes to “give back” by sharing his own memories for other historians. 1:20 Describes his childhood home at 96-08 72nd Road in [Forest Hills] , between Metropolitan Avenue and Union Turnpike, adjacent to Forest Park. 1:35* Neighborhood description - Forest Park had a bridle path and stables were located nearby. 2:00 The area reflected a suburban style of single-family homes. He describes it as a “nice way of living in New York City … without having to contend with the challenges of New York City.” 2:24 Family traveled to Manhattan for museums and Broadway shows, “but for the most part I was a Queens kid” (2:43). Traditional Queens experiences included attending Mets games and visiting the Hall of Science and Queens Museum in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Visited his grandmother Mary Jedrlinic in Flushing. 3:06 Enjoyed local entertainment such as the Cinemart movie theater and Eddie’s Sweet Shoppe. “That was kinda my universe.” 3:20 Describes visiting his grandmother at 154-11 Beech Avenue in Flushing. Her home was a very old house, constructed in the early 1900s. Large, single family. 4:10* Very large home was occupied by his grandmother, aunt, and great-uncle. Describes more of the family. Grandmother moved to Queens from Harlem. Her husband (Nick’s maternal grandfather, Nicholas Jedrlinic) died before Nick’s birth. 4:54 When asked to compare his grandmother’s neighborhood to his own Nick states, “I always thought that where I grew up was about the best you could have.” 5:16 Peace and tranquility of a tree-lined street with lots to do and see within a few blocks. Cinema, shopping, restaurants. 5:37 Comments on the beauty of Forest Hills Gardens, an area that looks like Europe. 5:50 Easy access to Manhattan and Long Island. Traveled to North Merrick to visit his paternal grandparents, Elaine Hirshon and Irving Hirshon. 6:18 Provides detail about Forest Hills Gardens. Founded about 1906 as an experiment of a private community off the beaten path. Now known for multi-million dollar Tudor-style homes. Designed by the architect Grovesnor Atterbury and Frederick Law Olmstead Jr., who created much of the park space. 8:03 Shares early memories of seeing the movie “The Land Before Time” on Continental Avenue in a theater that no longer exists. Street fairs on Austin Street. 8:23* Describes a field trip to the Hall of Science and dissecting a cow’s eye. He calls this the “ultimate thing … a rite of passage” for children of Queens. 8:40 Nick had a birthday party at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria. Nick believes his parents were the first to have a party hosted there. Explains that the museum has changed since then. In the late 80’s and early 90’s, it was still in early building stages. The museum provided kaleidescopes of images of iconic movie stars as party favors. (Interviewer note: The American Museum of the Moving Image opened to the public in 1988. It is now named the Museum of the Moving Image.) 9:41 Discusses his school experience. Attended Tally-Ho nursery school off Sybilla Street. Dixie Dew stables was next door. (Interviewer Note: Dixie Dew Stables was in business for over 80 years before closing.) The building also had a “disco floor” that was used for adults at night. He remembers hearing that the neighborhood objected when the parties got “too rowdy.” During the day they would use the space for the children. Recalls the song “Hands Up, Baby Hands Up.” 10:35 Attended Our Lady of Mercy School on Kessel Street from first to eighth grade. Attended Boy scouts meetings and church there. 11:04 Other students were white but a few African-American and Asian students. Students were mostly upper-middle class economically, from families who could afford a private school. He explains that the school “didn’t have a lot of drama.” Remained with a stable group of classmates during all his school years, therefore not much change in demographics. 13:06* Describes being confronted by armed robbers (disguised as UPS workers) while he was home with his father. Three men forced their way into the house and began removing valuables. This led to the family deciding to get a dog. 14:12 Family visited the North Shore Animal League on Long Island to adopt a dog. This was approximately 1997, when Nick was about 12years old. The family was interested in a dog named Bob (after the Good Samaritan who rescued him), who had been rescued after being injured when he ran into traffic. North Shore felt the dog was more suited to an older child. 15:20 But Bob (whom the Hirshon family renamed Spot) jumped on the bench to sit near Nick. Nick’s dad later described this as Spot choosing Nick. They “had a lot of fun together.” 15:43* Nick shares a funny story of walking Spot for the first time outside his grandparents’ home at 2006 Brian Drive in North Merrick, and Spot tried to run into traffic. This was the moment when Nick understood that Spot had an “issue” with cars. With training, Spot became “respectful” of traffic. 16:21 Spot went to Mobile Vet on Metroplitan Avenue, a business that still exists in that location. Spot loved going to the vet and always pulled them towards the shop door when they were walking on Metropolitan Avenue. 16:55 Spot attended the first “Dog’s Night at Shea Stadium” during a Mets game. Nick has submitted a photo of that event to the Queens Library. 17:11 Spot and the family participated in several Dogs Walks Against Cancer events including in Riverside Park and Farmingdale State College on Long Island. 17:34 Spot loved looking at the horses. Nick’s dad thought Spot was “confused” and thought they might have been big dogs. 18:05 Discussion of the impact of the home invasion on Nick. This changed his “personal” vision of safety. The neighborhood had always seemed extremely safe. Shattered this perception while still a kid. Very dramatic. 18:34 Robbers began to walk Nick and his father toward the basement. Nick’s father was concerned that they would be shot. When Nick’s father was able to open a side door and shout for help from the neighbors, one robber threatened to shoot Nick in the head. 19:16* Nick describes “one of the scariest moments of my life” – when the robber pointed a gun at his head and threatened to “kill the kid.” Robber ran out after making eye contact with Nick. 20:07 Resulted in some caution when delivery men came to the door. “Changes your trust factor.” 20:40 Don’t know why they came to their house. Police thought the robbers were likely looking for a “richer” house in Forest Hills Gardens and made a mistake. Nick’s mom also thought they were not the most skilled robbers as they did not take the most valuable items. 21:04 Most of his experience in Forest Hills and Queens demonstrated that it was a safe place so this event did not lead to a permanent change in his feeling of safety in his community. But it did lead to a TV appearance…. 21:28 Nick and his mother viewed a TV spot for the Leeza Gibbons talk show seeking guests for an upcoming show on home invasions. Nick encouraged the family to apply. They were accepted and flown to California and Nick and his father appeared on the show. 22:30 Describes getting a Mary Quaid scholarship from the Kiwanis Club of Richmond Hill/Woodhaven. It provided funds to be used for books when Nick was attending St. John’s University. Nick continues to receive invitations to an annual dinner (originally held at Le Cordon Bleu on Jamaica Avenue, since moved to other locations) where the new scholarship recipients are introduced. Likes the “sense of stability” it conveys and that it honors people in the community. When Nick was a reporter in Queens, he conducted an interview with the Rev. Skip L’Heureux, the president of the Kiwanis Club. Kiwanis had a reputation of “exclusionary” organization of white people of a certain economic status years ago, but by the time that Nick won the scholarship, it was more diverse and representative of the Richmond Hill community. 25:13 Former Masonic temple on Metropolitan Avenue. His grandfather Irving Hirshon, a musician who played the clarinet, played at a concert there. 25:34 In 2005, Nick became a reporter at the New York Daily News. Became more aware of community organizations and civic organizations. But was not involved as a child growing up. 26:25 Nick no longer lives in Queens. I asked him to reflect on Queens from this new perspective. 26:44 Much of Forest Hills has remained largely unchanged. Some businesses are gone, but the “character” of the neighborhood remains the same, with the same homes. Houses were not torn down and rebuilt as McMansions in the part of Forest Hills where he grew up. Parkland has not been built over. Forest Hills Gardens is covered by restrictive covenants and cannot be changed. Austin Street remains commercial but changes include an increase in banks. Likes the fact that there has been minimal change. Describes this part of Metropolitan Avenue like the quintessential main street of any small town with a library, American legion hall, old-fashioned ice cream parlor, movie theater, post office, and bank, all the iconic things from a 1950s small town. 28:22 Explains that he would like to live in Queens again. Public transportation, can live without a car. Culture: music, history museums, sports venues, safe, vibrant. Cultures of different countries. “An embarrassment of riches on Metropolitan Avenue.” Restaurants – Indian, Thai, Italian, Mediterranean. Can eat from a different country every day of the month. Hopes to someday return to live in the home where he grew up. 30:30 Describes becoming a sports fan, specifically the Mets. Remembers starting to dislike that the Yankees always won. 31:00 Upset that people from Queens were supporting the team from the Bronx when there was a local team to support and have pride in. Over a few months during the 1999 baseball season, he became well versed in baseball and specifically the Mets. 31:31 Went to his first game at Shea Stadium to watch the Mets play the Astros. (Interviewer’s note: Nick is referring to the first game he distinctly remembers attending on May 4, 1999, though his parents told him that he attended games earlier before he developed an interest in baseball.) He believes the tickets came through the cub scouts. The Mets lost but he enjoyed seeing the crowd and seeing world-famous athletes in his own backyard. 32:32 Also became connected to hockey when the family traveled to Long Island from Queens and Nick became aware of the Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders were “underdogs” but Nick enjoyed rooting for them and seeing world-class athletes in a stadium near his hometown. 34:00 Describes one of the most memorable sports events he ever attended, the first professional sporting event held in New York City after September 11. Nick was a high school sophomore at Monsignor McClancy in East Elmhurst. He shares memories of being in school that day. He explains that he was called to the principal’s office at about 8:30 in the morning. He was given the message that his father called to let Nick know he was OK and was not working near the WTC that day. He describes learning about the events as “the rumor mill was churning” because students did not have access to cell phones at that time. Some of what sounded like “crazy rumors” turned out to be true. From their windows in East Elmhurst they were able to see the billowing smoke. Describes heated discussion in the locker room among the boys anxious to “join the army” and make the perpetrators “pay” for what they did. 37:00 *After that all sporting events were cancelled for a period of time. Nick had tickets to the first Mets game to be played after the WTC attacks. On September 21, 2001, the Mets held their first game at Shea Stadium after Sept. 11. “Surreal” time to be there, with so much more going on than just the game. Mets were playing a good team, the Atlanta Braves. Rudy Giuliani threw out the first pitch and received an ”amazing ovation.” Diana Ross sang “God Bless America,” Mark Anthony sang the national anthem, and Liza Minelli sang “New York, New York.” Nick was with a friend from high school and recalls that there was no talking for the first four or five innings, ”this pall over the ball park ... so much emotion in the pregame ceremony.” After all the initial emotion the game seemed almost anti-climactic. 39:05* In the 5th or 6th inning the audience started to recover. The Mets’ Mike Piazza hit a very dramatic home run towards the end of the game and the Mets won. (Interviewer Note: Piazza’s home run came in the eighth inning.) There was a big emotional release. People from other parts of the country remember this game. ”New York is triumphant again.” Nick explains that this is now what he likes so much about sports. It can mean so much to people in overcoming adversity and demonstrating community spirit. ",
  "Holahan_Thomas_timecode.txt": "Thomas Holahan describes his trips to the 1964-1965 World�s Fair, traveling from Yonkers to Queens alone for the first time and comparing the trip to the journey to the park today. He touches on his favorite exhibits and pavilions and describes some of his clearest memories from the Fair, including a funny story about eating Belgian waffles with powdered sugar on a windy day. He also describes his interest in the religious pavilions, which offered profound spiritual experiences in the midst of a secular fair.

  "Holquin_Pedro_timecode.txt": "Pedro Holguin is Colombian by birth. He has resided in the United States since 1985, and is a longtime Queens�s resident. Pedro speaks of his values, his life in solitude and of his sexual orientation. He discusses the reasons that induced him to immigrate and of the labor it took to assimilate into the United States. 00:00:25 Pedro Holguin experienced problems securing employment in his native Colombia. This hardship continued until a relative offered Pedro assistance to come to the United States. The only catch was that Pedro had to travel across the Mexican / United States Border. He accepted the money because he wanted to meet with friends and relatives that were living in the United State. The relative that offered him assistance had connections in the city of Tijuana. He accomplished the border crossing with a mother and her two children. The mother and her children had been fleeing the violence in Colombia. The woman had received multiple death threats and decided that she would be better off in the United States. Pedro and his group crossed the Mexican / United States border with assistance from a �coyote�. He recalls his trek without hardship. One issue that the mother faced was being separated from her children. She later rendezvoused with her children in San Diego, California. Pedro separated from the mother and her children when they all arrived in New York City. 00:03:15 When Pedro arrived in the United States border his life as an illegal immigrant began to trouble his relatives here. First off, his relatives did not know anything about Pedro arrival and later found out that he did not request a visa from the American Consulate in Colombia. Once in New York City, his family told him that the police would arrest him. Pedro communicated with his relative�s friends who advised him that he had to kept quiet so that nothing would happens to him. Pedro obtained shelter and food, but needed to work. His friends advised him to go to New Jersey where supposedly one would find work, but he found that this was not the case. He later moved back to Brooklyn and finally found employment Pedro searched for work using the newspaper and found a job in Queens, but found the long commute a struggle. He moved to live with friends in Queens and began living a semi-iterant lifestyle. 00:06:16 In Colombia, Pedro lived with his family consisting of his mother and brothers. Pedro was not economically sufficient because he had no career. Like many of his friends, Pedro moved to the United States in search of new horizons. He worked very hard, and had many ups and downs during his first job where he sewed clothes. He learned that friends in the United States that lied about their professional accreditation. Some of these people were able to secure well-paying jobs with important titles. Pedro could not find it in himself to lie. 00:08:26 Pedro learned a great deal about the different peoples and the diverse cultures that live together in the United States. He encountered stereotypes that portrayed Colombians as drug traffickers. In his second job, he met to a Dominican woman that assisted him in finding a high paying job at another company. Pedro took the job not know that he was actually working to replace a worker who had temporarily left. His boss asked him to stay and this caused him to make enemies at his workplace. Pedro became involved in his local union. They later aided him in finding work in Brooklyn. 00:11:17 By 1990 Pedro had lived in the United States for five years. He then began to complete his application for permanent residency. He comments that his residency application was processed faster. He comments that his mother who was vetted for his sister experienced difficulty with her application. 00:12:03 Pedro�s employer went broke and he lost his job. But the company union assisted him in finding another job in Brooklyn. 00:12:36 Pedro discusses how he felt distant from his family in the United States. He felt uncomfortable because some of them only spoke English and Pedro wanted to communicate in Spanish. Pedro began to make friends in other parts of Queens including blind photographer Sonia Soberats. They eventually lived together for a short while. In 1995 Pedro eventually obtained his own apartment on account that his mother was coming to visit him soon. The apartment was very expensive and Pedro had to take in housemates to pay his rent. Pedro�s mother and sister joined Pedro in New York City. His mother who came with the intention of staying in the United States could not get accustomed to the American way of life. She missed her children in Colombia and eventually moved back. 00.15:50 Pedro encountered many cultural obstacles when he first moved to the United States. One thing that stuck Pedro was the concept of instant and microwaveable food. In Colombia, Pedro was used to fresh meals made with fresh food. Clearly, he had reached a new level of understanding about his himself through his new situation as an immigrant. 00: 17:44 In 1999 Pedro was diagnosed with chronic tendonitis. He was scared because he lost the sensitivity and the strength in fingers which he used to design, cut, and tailor cloth. Pedro was forced to leave his job which he took very hard. He did continue to work. 00:19:06 After Pedro lost his job he began to volunteer at a non-profit that defended the rights of HIV positive people. A year later, he was offered a paid position with the organization. In 2001 Pedro decided to undergo surgery to relieve the tendonitis on both his hands. The surgery was successful but his hands were not 100% back to normal. In the meantime, Pedro�s company union continued to give him worker�s compensation. Pedro thought about returning to Colombia but he did not want to be a coward and decided to remain here. He enjoyed working at the non-profit. Pedro later faced a major catastrophe when he became infected with tuberculosis and he received a cancer diagnosis. Pedro also lost his apartment due to the lack of advice from his social worker. His mother also decided to return to Colombia and Pedro found friends who gave him room and board. In 2008, a relative recommended that he move to Florida for the climate. Pedro shortly visited Florida but did not find it to his liking. He did not have a car and he did not like the humidity. Pedro departed Florida to Colombia for a while. He then went back to New York City. 00:26:00 When Pedro returned to New York, he began to better understand the plight that different immigrants face in this country. [In fact Pedro always uses the word \"emigrant\"] Pedro claims that the United States is a country of immigrants and that the President [Trump] must know the laws if he wanted to avoid making mistakes that go against the people�s interest. Pedro believes that recent immigrant should not have less or fewer rights because of their new status. Pedro believes that Latinos are rejected in the United States despite their numbers as the largest minority population in this country. He said that it is time to have a Latino President. Everybody here has the chance and opportunity. 00:30:36 New York and California offers courses to prepare and inform leaders and regular citizens about the rights of the HIV positive. Pedro could not find employment in a similar organization when he was in Florida. This was because the Cuban population in Florida had a monopoly on such jobs. Pedro talks about how the Cuban population fiercely guarded these healthcare jobs and distributed these jobs among their own communities. Pedro states that in Florida the different Latino populations work together to tackle problems in their home countries. Pedro recalls having the opportunity to create a new non-profit organization in Florida that would support the local HIV positive population. His efforts were stonewalled by the sizable Cuban majority in Florida. Pedro claims that there is a hierarchy of immigrants from Spanish speaking countries. He claims that were is visible discrimination that comes from the upper echelons. Pedro goes onto state that immigrants can obtain powerful jobs with important titles, but in the �we are all immigrants [remember that Pedro always uses the word \"emigrants\"] and we have to do whatever it takes to survive�. Pedro believes that when people arrive to come to the United States they must learn the language and study. 00:36:05 When Pedro first arrived knew nothing regarding cooking and he had to learn to cook from scratch. He found it was a challenge but he found that he learned to cook by asking other people for assistance. Sometimes he found this father hard because of his shy demeanor. Pedro dealt with his shyness by attending leadership workshops sponsored by the government. He practices English, but still lacks the ability to be fluent. Pedro recounts the many physical and psychological obstacles he faced when he arrived in the United States. He says that everyone faces obstacles during their lives, regardless of origin. 00:44:50 Pedro�s first community oriented job entailed handing out condoms at the Village. He had to learn not to let anything affect him, because many times people rejected the free condoms he passed out. Pedro states that human sexuality is not treated as an open subject and that favors the conditions that led to the AIDS epidemic. He continues this by saying that often time religion and religious institutions look to cover this problem. He continues this by citing the discriminations that Latin American immigrants and LGBTQ people face in this country. Pedro defends the plight of LGBTP. He ends this stream of conversation by saying that religious institutions should not meddle in creating national policy that affect the LGBTQ. 00:51:53 Pedro says that his family prays together. They celebrate Thanksgiving together. Pedro continues to give his opinions about religious sects and their influence in the family life. He claims that religious institutions make people confuse veneration with idolatry. He makes special reference to the Jehovah�s Witnesses. 00:56:15 Pedro says America�s culture encourages Latin American immigrants to be punctual. The Latin people that have had luck here they want to take advantage of the others which just came to this country after them, but not all races make that same: European, Chinese and Jewish are always helping among themselves... Latinos have to join and help themselves as well. He says that with his own family he has passed many negative things, but now they admire him for being honest and for demanding his rights. 00:59:30 Pedro could have been Sherman of the Union, but many, that were in the peak, were opposed because he was not Italian, while the most was in accordance with him. The first unions emerged in the works known as \"workshops of sweat\" because they were performed in basements and with low conditions, really inhumane situations. The purpose of the unions was finished with those abuses.him. The first unions emerged in the works known as \"workshops of sweat\" because they were performed in basements and with low conditions, really inhumane situations. The purpose of the unions was finished with those abuses. 01:02:36 Latin people are very discouraged. Which is up will take advantage from the others that are down. Again Pedro speaks upon the lies about the titles to get work... The people are slaves at work and they do not aspire to study and to advance, and progress. Pedro learned of their own setbacks, by his studies and his health problems. He studied English and computer science, but by being asking the disability lawyer struck him, but he didn't want to do nothing, but something had to be done he said to himself... The family did not help him in this country of the opportunities... Many people do not take advantage of the opportunities that they have here because is accurate to make sacrifices and sleep so little time for studying and working. Latino people come with the ego of being the doctor so-and-so of such, but here they are like any other person, and to the end we are all equal, by that reason is that we love this country... He speaks of the deal between the Latin people and the respect... 01:14:50 Pedro reflects on how ethnic groups come to the power in this country, he puts examples of the Kennedys and of Donald Trump. He speaks of the Jews. 01:16:48 In this country people \"take it\" with Latinos for being darkish, Latinos that have indigenous features, but these lands were originally living by indigenous people... Spain sent the worst people to America, but Latinos came out good people. The Spanish took all our wealth. We have been mistreated by the Europeans and we don't know why... Speaking of Koch as Mayor of New York, he has a negative opinion about him. Speaking of education in Latin America and here, as well as of the importance that teaches geography. Speaking of Hillary Clinton and Obama. 01:21:05 Pedro went to see a psychologist for depression that had... Climate changes are here in New York especially extreme cold than he never imagined it could be. That is why he went to Florida. He has to use a cane in winter. All that led him to depression. Unlike others, he looked for alternative psychologists that helped him... His grandmother had taught him to abandon material things, but the Latin people adhere to the material. One has to change because everything in life is ephemeral. ",
  "Hong_Young-Ok_timecode.txt": "Ms. Hong moved to the United States with her two daughters in 1991. Ok-young�s sister had married an American citizen and settled in the country. Ok-young�s in-laws invited her to come to America. Ms. Hong�s husband left for American five years earlier in 1986. He worked bring his wife and children to American. After he came to American, Her husband continued her career in promoting and teaching Korean cultural arts throughout New York. [*Note: Korean cultural arts span various spoken word and performances. These cultural arts often involve wearing traditional Korean clothes (han-bok) and performing with traditional Korean instruments] 00:00:28 Ms. Hong arrived in America on December 31st 1990. She continued her career of working to promote Korean cultural arts in her country. 00:01:00 Young-ok first settled in Forest Hills where she lived for five years. She then moved to a place located at the intersection of Parsons Boulevard and Northern 194th Street where she lived for approximately five years. She then moved to Sunnyside where she lived for three more years. Hong-ok has lived in Queens for about twenty years. 00:02:25 She found Forest Hills quieter than Flushing. She also heard from other Koreans living in Flushing who spoke about Forest Hills. Ms. Hong encountered a large Jewish community in Forest Hills that kept the neighborhood tidy. She also enjoyed Forest Hill�s European-esque qualities. 00:04:35 She and her husband both operated small stores after they settled in New York. Her husband operated a store up in the Bronx when he first moved to the country. Ms. Hong-ok operated a store in Brooklyn. She and her husband were not close with their neighbors because they faced a language barrier and because of their busy schedules. She particularly was drawn to the Forest Hill�s ambience. She found Flushing too dense and chaotic and did not enjoy it. 00:07:45 Ms. Hong�s husband had already lived in the United States for five years by the time she arrived in the United States. He was overjoyed to be reunited with his wife and two daughters. 00:08:36 Because her friends and family live far apart, Young-ok�s entire family could not gather together for the larger Korean holidays including (Chu-seok) and Lunar New Year. Instead during these large holidays Korean Young-ok and her immediate family attended outside Korean cultural art performances. Because of her family�s busy schedule she and her family did never went on vacations. 00:10:38 Ms. Hong talks about how difficult she found settling in her country. She then talks about how much harder it must have been for people who came before her. 00:11:15 Ms. Hong�s found her friends and her in-laws already in America. Her husband decided to sell his business and set a date to move to America. Ms. Hong�s younger sister had settled in the United States forty years ago. This relationship allowed Ms. Hong to invite her entire family to live in the United States. Ms. Hong moved to America thinking that she could continue her career teaching traditional Korean art. But she found that this was not the case. 00:13:25 In the 1970�s Ms. Hong�s younger sister also a teacher of traditional Korean art managed to go on tour and visit New Jersey and Philadelphia. Ms. Hong�s sister was first introduced to her husband while on tour in America. She and her traveling troupe were invited to a house party hosted by later fianc�e. Her young sister�s husband had immigrated to the United States when he was in middle school. 00:16:00 Ms. Hong lived in Sunnyside for ten years. They later moved to Westchester, New York . They managed to live there because Ms. Hong�s husband applied for senior citizen house after turning sixty-two. Ms. Hong wanted to work with her local Korean community association as a platform to advocate for traditional Korean art. She found the Korean community there lacking in spirit and she had a hard time advocating for her programs. She found the Korean community in Westchester not as united as the Korean community she was familiar working with in Flushing. After five years of advocating for traditional Korean programs, Ms. Hong took a break from pursuing more outreach. 00:21:32 Ms. Hong describes Westchester as mixed community comprised of Korean, Japanese, and other immigrants, many of whom are retired and liked to climb the mountains nearby. She found that the elderly Korean community there lacking unity. Two year ago she estimated that there are about 30,000 Korean immigrants and Koreans living in Westchester. 00:23:37 Ms. Hong describes Sunnyside a very heterogeneous neighborhood with many different immigrant communities. Sunnyside was very conveniently located and one could easily travel to Manhattan and Flushing from Sunnyside. She has noted that Sunnyside�s Korean population has moved away and its numbers dwindled. She found herself not interaction with her neighbors in her apartment. 00:27:11 Because most of her family lives in the United States, America feels more like home (country) to her. However she still only rides Korean car services. Her lack of English skills and inability to communicate clearly is a cause for personal fear. 00:28:15 Ms. Hong founds Queens very comfortable because of the sizable Korean population. She feels that one does not that to be a fluent English speaker to reside in Queens. She and her husband mainly interacted with other Koreans in Flushing and were not frustrated by language barriers. 00:31:50 Ms. Hong has observed that Chinese immigrant will spend their extra income in purchasing material goods, while Korean immigrants save it to bequeath to their children. She notes that there are subgroups within the Korean immigrant population. Some include Korean immigrants who first came as college students forty years ago while others settled in American to start small businesses. She notes that many Koreans had sharp business skills. Korean women expanded into nail salons and beauty supply stories. She notes that there used to be a sizable population of Korean wholesalers in Manhattan on 32rd street. Their numbers have since dwindled. 00:35:18 Despite her lack of strong English skills, Ms. Hong managed to operate a small business. However her desire to each and promote Korea traditional art was strong. Because of this drive she closed her business to pursue her passion. At the age of forty Ms. Hong took to a new career in painting nails. It was at that time she managed to meet other Korean traditional artists. They threw many traditional Korean events and continue to do so to this day. 00:39:03 In the past the Korean community in Queens would celebrate Chu-seok (Korean Thanksgiving) by gathering at Shea Stadium. The Korean community would rent the baseball stadium parking lot. But Ms. Hong did not particularly enjoy the ambience. Now Queens College is the host for a smaller Queens based Chu-seok festival. In additional the Korean Daily News (a local newspaper) hosts a larger Chu-seok festival every first week of October in midtown Manhattan. In May, there would be many events showcasing traditional Korean arts including in Brooklyn and even in Long Island. Ms. Hong worked hard to coordinate these events. In the past these events used to be free but now they are being hindered by rising costs and expenses. Sometime during September and December of every year, the Queens Library hosts a large International Festival dedicated to showcasing the different communities that make up Queens. Ms. Hong worked to secure one hour of the festival and have it used to showcase Korean traditional arts. 00:42:45 The Korean Community Service Center is a premier non-profit organization based in New York City that receives federal support. KSC�s director Kwang-Suk Kim and the young staff members have been role models for the Korean American community. KSC works hard to advocate and provide support for New York�s Korean American community and new Korean immigrants. The KSC works hard to leave property and building for the descendants of future generation of Korean-American and Korean immigrants. 00:45:20 In New York, many different ethnic communities look to promote their respective traditional cultural events. In order to serve the community one can do more than donate money. One can donate their talents and volunteer hours. However Ms. Hong sees this camaraderie lacking in the Korean American community. She believes that the Korean American community needs to learn solidarity at a younger age. Traditional Korean arts advocates also need to serve their communities. 00:49:00 Ms. Hong observes that those Koreans who have received American style education are much more confident in speaking their minds and have different values from Koreans who have studied in Korea. Ms. Hong observed the free spirit nature of the American born Korean students at a Saturday Korean school. She wondered to herself if the latter generation of Koreans being raised would be too free spirited. 00:54:20 Ms. Hong�s two daughters live in Atlanta, George. They left New York City after living here twenty-six year because they found it too congested and expensive. They moved to Atlanta because the weather is warmer and the cost of living is more affordable. 00:55:53 The transportation to and from Flushing is very convienent with many bus routes available in Flushing. Ms. Hong uses public transportation very frequently and spends most of her time at traditional Korean dance classes at KCS. 00:57:10 Although Ms. Hong was originally a Buddhist in Korea, in American she found herself attending the church near Kissena Park after her brother became a pastor. Although the church plays a critical role in assisting new Korean immigrants, Ms. Hong feels that the church can be more proactive in strengthening community bonds. She feels that the church should be more active in promoting traditional Korean arts to Korean children. 01:01:55 American society has a tendency to view Koreans born in America as Koreans and not as Americans. She notes that Korean churches in America should take care to assist Korean American adapt with their complex and layered identity during their formative years. 01:03:45 Ms. Hong notes that traditional Korean arts require a successor but so far a successor organization has been hard to establish. Often times traditional Korean art students will choose a non-art major in college. She lastly notes that it is hard to establish strong Korean artistic traditions without a strong sense of identity and duty. ",

Her teachers were so impressed that Cynthia knew how to read. She would read to her class while her teachers would grade papers. Classes loved having her read, they were the same age and she was reading, she would add details to the book and change her voices so no one would be bored. 00:06:25 In the 6th grade, Cynthia wanted to be a journalist. In high school, she started writing in the school newspaper. She started writing a column about school activities for the local newspaper which she turned in once a week. Living in California, Cynthia attended Pepperdine University in Malibu where she majored in Journalism. 00:08:20 After graduation, it was difficult for Cynthia to get a job because of how young she looked. So she decided to work for a younger company where her young appearance didn�t matter. That�s when she got a job at �Right On!� Magazine. 00:10:22 One of her first interviews was with Michael Jackson. They were both shy and nervous people so they got along really well. His father asked her to come over to their house because Michael didn�t have a lot of friends. In their house they had animals that you would see at the zoo. They soon became friends and she was over there all the time and would sometimes even sleepover. 00:13:00 She went to Michael�s funeral. Now that he�s passed away his music is bigger than ever. 00:14:48 A lot of the hip hop stars now have TV shows, which is a very significant thing in the industry today. Back in the 1970s, hip hop songs was just party music. Now it�s a movement that�s been embraced everywhere. 00:17:30 LL Cool J was just a fifteen year old rapper when Cynthia first met him and now he�s a successful TV star whose starring in NCIS. 00:19:21 Hip Hop has given African American people a voice, now a majority of rappers are sending messages of positivity. Rappers like to rap about the conditions in their area, such as violence, crime, or drive-by shootings. By them talking about it, brings it to the attention of the media. The riots in Baltimore, people were crying out and expressing their frustration for conditions that went unnoticed for years. Rappers went down there so they can do press conferences. 00:23:25 Everyone deserves the opportunity to learn to read. People need to go to their public libraries and support programs, so speakers can come and enrich people�s lives. 00:25:40 Cynthia became a good writer because she loved reading. It makes her a good person to interview people, she can speak to people about a variety of subjects. 00:26:08 We�re in a digital age, everything happens by computers, you have to be able to keep up. If you go to the library, they have resources to help you. They have computers and staff that can help you after school. 00:28:00 Literacy and hip hop go hand in hand because hip hop is actually teaching people through the rhymes and messages and if people don�t use those messages responsibly its not having the proper impact. Rappers like Common, always has something positive to say that can very much enrich your life. 00:29:00 Nas was at 92nd Y being interviewed by someone and people were all in silence because what he said was so prolific. They had a Q&A session in the end where students in the audience. 00:30:40 In America we have a lot of in injustices so music is our relief, one way that soothes our spirits and makes us feel better. People are trying harder to send a positive message. 00:31:10 Queens Library has tried to make Cynthia sort of like an ambassador and do programs that can enrich the lives of the community. But this can lead to other speakers to come and talk. We need people who can raise money for libraries; libraries always need money for programs and funds. 00:32:10 Hip hop has changed the face of television. Empire is a music show that has practically an all African American cast with ratings of 25 million people. This has never occurred in the past and so we need to embrace this change. 00:33:01 Now that hip hop has made it to television, it�s created so many jobs. Actors, makeup artists, screen writers, etc. This is a way for African Americans to have a future and now that they�re in the door, there�s no stopping them. ",
  "Hostettler_Paula_timecode.txt": "“So we realized we already lived in the best neighborhood in New York.” “I have lived in Sunnyside since 1972. There was a time when my husband and I thought we’d have enough money to live in Manhattan, so we checked all our best choices and after two days we decided that Manhattan was too crowded, noisy, impersonal and had no big grocery stores. So we realized we already lived in the best neighborhood in New York. Because of a power outage on the 7 train I met a woman who has lived one block away from me for the last 35 years. We are now fast friends. We have had a pretty serious feral cat problem, so various local groups formed a trap-neuter-return program and got the problem under control. I learned a lot about my neighbors by meeting them as a campaign manager for a Republican candidate for City Council.” ",

  "Howard-Potter_Jack_timecode.txt": "Leslie: Are you ready to go? Go ahead and introduce yourself. Jack: Okay my name is Jack Howard Potte. I'm 43 years old. I live in New York City and Manhattan. I was born and raised in Manhattan. I am 3rd Generation Native New Yorker. My grandfather was born in New York City my mother was born in New York City. I was born in New York City on January 2nd 1975. I have two kids Skyler and Linden and they are 4th generation native New Yorkers which, I must say I'm quite proud of. Jack: I was born and raised on the Upper East Side. I grew up in the city. I went to school in the city. I started my investigation of the arts at a really early age. In high school I experimented with woodworking, plaster, ceramics, painting drawing. I knew very clearly when I was in high school that I wanted to be an artist of some kind. I just wasn't sure exactly what yet, and so some of the things I did in high school that really fueled that desire to be an artist was, I was doing a lot of large-scale paintings. I was doing some drawing. I spent quite a lot of time working with Ceramics and I made a whole series of ceramic. Goblets sort of in the vein of the. Holy Grail. Jack: And so I knew that there was something about this process of working with my hands and making objects that attracted me and that I really wanted to pursue. I went to college in New York State up outside of Albany and Schenectady New York, so I'm sort of a New Yorker through and through. Regarding High School what high school did you go I went to boarding school in Connecticut it was calling conference school I went to school in New York City at a school on the up recycled Saint Bernard’s. Then I went to Union College in Schenectady New York and graduated with a degree in art history and sculpture, a BA in 1997. While I was in college I was still experimenting in the Arts and trying to figure out my medium, and so I worked again and wood and plaster and clay and you know painting and drawing and all different kinds of things. When I was a junior in college I was on the sculpture 3 class and I finally learned to weld, and there was a teacher who is on sabbatical and so there was an artist from New York City her name was Marcia Pals. She came in to teach for a semester and she was teaching sculptures 3 and she taught us at a well and from the very first weld that I made in college I instantly knew that that was the material that I wanted to pursue. Jack: The first weld I made is this so you know, was a mix of sort of technology in magic all at once. It’s a your taking a completely hard and movable material which is steel and in a split-second your liquefying it into molten metal and a connecting it together and there was something about that sort of instantaneous change in the form of the material that I was really drawn to and I knew right away I wanted to work in steel. Leslie: Do you still have that first piece? Jack: No when you are first learning, you are welding scraps together to really learn the process. I learn to weld as a junior and then I knew instantly that this was the material I wanted to pursue so I spent the rest of that year basically doing found object sculpture like going to a scrap yard in finding bits of steal from a scrap yard welding them together and making pieces that way. There was something about that that I really didn't like because each of the little objects that I was taking from the scrap yard had a little story to it. Jack: You could tell it was a piece of an I-beam her that it was a cut off from something else in each piece. Each piece that I was using had its own sort of identity and I didn't really want that I wanted to make things that were really uniquely from me. I started using Links of Steel 20 feet long and you know I started with quarter inch round rods that are 20 feet long and I started cutting them and bending them and using those to make statues because they didn't have a story they didn't have an identity didn't really have anything that the viewer could infer from the material it was all about what I did with the material to create the work. So the next year is a senior I started very quickly making steel figures so in 1996 and 97. Jack: That last year of college I made 16 life-size figurative of Steel sculptures. Some of them had some found-object pieces still incorporated in them but for the most part they were all made out of this these long rods that I had cut and bent and put together. I was very interested in the human form and making sculpture of people because as I was studying in art history and some of the earliest forms that artist made representations of people. so I really wanted to sort of respect the tradition of art history in making figures and also sort of bring my own sense ability to it and so start of further and extend the history of making figures with my work. I had a show of the 16 figures my senior year sold about a third of them which was great/ Jack: I then you know graduated college just left school I realize that it was very important to gain a deeper understanding of the material so I actually went moved out to Colorado and I work for a blacksmith from Long Island Leslie: Wow that’s pretty cool. Jack: When I had moved to Colorado and I was making steel furniture with this blacksmith from Long Island in Colorado and I spent two years really learning how to weld you know from a production standpoint you know like producing Furniture in fact the chair you're sitting on was made during that time. and so I learn how to manipulate steel you know I learned grind steel, seal it from rusting and incredibly in-depth education in how the material reacts you know while it's in process. I still was reacting to the material in the same way that I was in that first well there's something about the fact that you could you know make mistakes you could cut something and steal and then reattach it. You know if you’re working with wood and cut something too short still sort of done and need a new piece of wood. Steel is sort of ultimately malleable and changeable and so you can add you can take a way you can add again you can take away again this is constant process of addition and subtraction happens when I'm making a sculpture that really I can only do when I'm working and steel and so I left that two years with this really deep strong understanding of working in steel I move back to New York City and actually moved into an apartment in Williamsburg so this was like 1999 in Williamsburg , and it was still a very polish neighborhood there was still a kielbasa shop in the Polish Bakery and a polish grocery store. In a Polish people in the neighborhood and now I got a studio very very close to Long Island City in Queens actually on Commercial Street near Commercial Street in Williamsburg right over the water from Long Island City and there was always a sense that like Long Island City was very close by and even at that time A lot of people are saying well that's going to be the next place cuz already Williamsburg was starting to get build up there was restaurants in buildings and you know this was way in the beginning in 1999 but I had this knowledge now of the material and I had a studio and I was back at my home and I started making works in the started making figures . I started showing figures and sculptures at a gallery and I still felt like there was something missing in my work. Jack: So I went to a place in the city which is 100 plus year old Arts institution called the art students league and I started learning, figure drawing, well not really learning figure drawing but really studying the human figures Anatomy at the art students league and so I would go there 5 days a week I did thousands of drawings over the course of probably about 2 or 3 years. I became the assistant to the professor very quickly and the professor was only there two days of the week so the other three days of the week the students are there drawing from a live model using the inspectors techniques and teachings and so you sort of becoming a surrogate teacher in a way where you know you're you become very familiar with what the instructors trying to teach people how to do it so people have been looking to you for advice and I mean I spent two and a half years doing thousands of drawings from a live model and learning the human anatomy learning how muscles move. How bones support how it all kind of comes together and that process was very important to me. Jack: My work, because I really now had this intense understanding of the material and then got this intense understanding of the human anatomy and so it was time to kind of put those two things together. my wife got into law school so we moved up to Albany New York New York. Leslie: And your wife’s name? Jack: Her name is Erika. Jack: And we moved to Albany New York and before I left the city I was working at the art students League I was teaching an after school program for kids at a high school I was doing work in my own studio and so between the art students league and after school program I was running. My own work was sort of third in line. When we moved to Albany, I made a commitment to myself and I quit all my jobs and I started only making figures. Leslie: so this allowed you to solely focus on your work? Jack: Yes, so I spent three years up in Albany making figures, life sized figures in steel that were really fully fleshed-out you know they were fully developed and I had to weld it in about 2 years at that point and I started making a series of very large figures and started showing them in public you know I got a show at the southern Vermont Arts Center which is in Manchester Vermont and I had never really considered the public Realm. But I got the show at the Sculpture Park and I put a bunch of work outside and I love that the barrier that the gallery sometimes creates unintentionally with people on the street was broken down. You know the scriptures were approachable by anybody they were out in nature are they looks great in the landscape and a lot of my sort of Idols in the art world had done public sculpture you know like Alexander Calder David Smith George Ricky and so you know they had made a lot of large outdoor public work and I thought, oh yeah it never really occurred to me that I could do that so I started doing a lot of large outdoor public sculpture. Jack: My wife got her law degree and we move back to New York City in 2006 and at that point Williamsburg was totally developed you know there was it was very difficult to find a studio space there. So I remember back in 99 thinking about Long Island City and so I came to explore Long Island City in Queens. I was living on the Upper East Side the proximity to where I was living was very attractive to me because it was so close to the city but once you cross the bridge you were like a world away. You know it felt it was the city but it felt to remove from the city and so I got a studio on Borden Avenue in Long Island City it was a. Jack: Okay looks it like it did pause. So I think basically, I know I came back to New York City and I was trying to find a studio space and Williamsburg was like way too expensive and way too developed and it really wasn't that attractive to me. I also got the sense that there was not a lot of artists left in York City. I mean in Williamsburg at that point in 2006. So I looked into Long Island City and I came over to the neighborhood and I started walking around and I started talking to people and I talked to some of my friends who had Studios out here and I realized very quickly that there was this incredible sort of. Jack: Quiet art scene in Long Island City and what I mean by quiet art scene in Long Island City was there was really this Core Group a very dedicated artist and professional artist who had studios here for working here who are committed to their work and to the neighborhood all at the same time and it wasn't sort of like a lot of artist you know sort of like. Feigning art artist, feigning Artistry you know that I can sort of like having a studio and kind of maybe doing some stuff and not really doing some stuff but like being a starving artist. The artist here was like committed working professional head careers and they had this great community and so I'm in 2006 I got a studio on Borden Avenue with a view of the midtown tunnel in a Long Island railroad tracks on one side midtown tunnel on the other side. There were quite a few artists in the building there was a painter up on the top floor there was another guy who worked in the building. There were also furniture makers in there was seen all kinds of different people in the building. I got it I got this incredible Studio space with a view of New York City and you know I could get out here from where I was living in New York City over the 59th Street Bridge very easily. Leslie: Do you think that is what attracted a lot of people to come to that neighborhood, the location itself? Jack: You know there was still was wonderful and there still is to a certain extent although it seems to be disappearing. There was really wonderful industrial infrastructure you know there was buildings that were allowing you know the possibility to weld. To weld you can't go in the building it's made out of wood you know I kind of concrete floors, cinderblock wall, and large doors to get stuff in and out of and so to have a there was there was the right kind of buildings for artist to be working in so that's one reason. The second reason was that it was at that time much less expensive than having us to use impossible to have a studio in SoHo it was impossible to have a studio in Williamsburg and so you know in terms of just financially being able to find enough space Long Island City was a great option for that. You know when I first came out here to Long Island City in 2006 there was one there was two large towers there was a Citibank building which has been there since. Jack: Take the 90s. You know and then there was a tower on the Water by the Pepsi sign. I think it's called the Avalon it's the red one. That’s the only two big buildings everything else was small low Industrial neighborhood. So you know I came out here I moved out here I got my studio and I found an incredible community of working artists and I very quickly after the first couple of years of working and commuting over the bridge and getting to know the neighborhood and the people around me. There started a great organization called The Long Island City Art open. The Long Island City Arts open I believe it’s in its 9th year. I've been involved every single year since it started and really it was started by a guy named Richard Mazda who still in the neighborhood who has the theater of the secret Theatre. He had this idea that you could promote the Arts and you can bring people to Long Island City. Jack: To be a part of what the artists are making by utilizing some of the underutilized areas in the neighborhood. So what he really started to do was he would find empty commercial spaces and he would for a week in May fill them with arts and fill them with shows and so he would have in a local curators and he would have local artists and they would put in a sculpture in an empty commercial space. The landlords would agree to give us the space cuz it was only a week or two and they were getting people in there to see the spaces and a community building. As soon as I started doing the Long Island City Arts open I became very friendly with all those professional working artists that were out here you know members of Long Island City Arts. Richard from the secret Theatre are you know there was you know people who are out here for you know 20 30 years you know as artists and working in studios. I felt like I was starting to really become a part of this great community. Jack: What is really amazing creative Community where everybody was supporting each other they were going to each other's openings they were helping each other solve problems you know if somebody needed you know like something made out of neon you went to go see Kenny Greenberg was the neon guy and then you know if somebody else was you know having an issue with you no tiling or mosaic you would talk to Karen about that. You know if you needed something in Ceramics you go to the guys at Brick House and talk to them at the Ceramics and then there was this amazing energy among these people. Leslie: Do you still find that know? Jack: Oh definitely I find that now. I wouldn’t still be here you know where all you know it in some ways really kind of like fighting for our life. I mean you know this is 2006 and it was still sort of quiet out here you know very quickly you know after like 2008 you know so like 2009 building started to be built no and developer started coming in and I started snatching up properties and they started building Towers. I mean you know the skyline of Long Island City now in 2018 compared to when I came out here in 2016 is like a completely different place. I mean you know there's a dozen or more towers by the Avalon now in the water there are in a tall building basically all around the Citibank building now it doesn't stand there all by itself anymore. So as I’ve been out here for the last 12 years I've seen this incredible change in the neighborhood, and this incredible push to start a build out here. One of the drawbacks of that I mean it's great the people discovered Long Island City one of the drawbacks of that is that the industrial spaces the commercial spaces you know the places where artists are working you are being demolished in or the rents are getting too high or you know the artist or just getting pushed out because I was going up in you know the towers have you know hundreds of residential apartments in them and the people that are going to be out there are not necessarily like , they are living there it's residential on so that the community of artists in the places that we have the kind of working and do our thing is being diminished . That being said there is that being said you look very Vibrant Community out here I mean a lot of people that I first met you know they're still here you know they found a way to kind of stay and work and we found Jack: Sympathetic landlords that support the Arts don't want to see that kind of Creative Energy drained from the neighborhood. What makes the neighborhood so great is that creative energy. Long Island City Art open started as a very sort of you know quiet ramshackle band of artists you know like putting shows on you. This past year we had shown in you know there's a couple of buildings over behind LaGuardia Community College that you know they're like very serve successful commercial buildings in that there's offices and there's food production and their Studios and there's like one of them has offices for Macy's in it and a they are viable legitimate spaces now but they preserve small spaces for artist to be able to show their work and so they understood that this Creative Energy is important to the neighborhood, and they supposed it in many different ways. So we had a couple of shows over there this past May where we had hundreds of people that openings over the course of you know night after night after night and multiple shows and there's a couple of galleries over there that go year-round now I sort of Long Island City Arts open galleries year-round and they have you know productive shows in the members of the community put group shows in and they have solo shows. So they're their there has been this you know preservation of the community that I found out here really by the community advocating for yourself. So one of the things that you know I find the most appealing about Long Island City is this really tight-knit community of artist that exists and is trying to hold on and that is supporting each other and working together. You know I mean one of the great sculptors of Our Generation Mark has had a studio in Long Island City on the water. For many many many years I think he came out here in the 80s it was Total Industrial Wasteland he bought something nobody wanted transformed into an amazing studio for himself and the outgrowth of that was a Socrates Sculpture Park which is right nearby and is a very well respected you know world class Sculpture Park now. So those kinds of investments in the community that the artist of made of really made it what it is today and so I think because a lot of artists and put their time and energy into creating a home out here, they want to continue to have a home out here so they're they're hanging on not to be sort of driven out by a lot of what's going on in Long Island City. You know the building where we are now this hallway here has. Jack: For other Studios besides mine and so there's five of us artist on this one hallway here you know. When I moved into this building I was the only artist on this hallway. That really also speaks to the fact that like the landlord that I have now wants to support the Arts. He recognizes the value of having you know people in his buildings that are artists and so he has been very sympathetic to the community of artists and has. Use his building as a place where artists can come in work and you seeing that. In some way it's great because we have this Vibrant Community here and the people in this building who are you know serve on the same page that I am I need a hand I find it sort of, troubling because it indicates that there's not a lot of other places for them to go right like where one of the last bastions of studios and so that's really you know kind of difficult for you know. The group of people that that are that are out here. You know because if all of a sudden you know this building gets old and you know a big huge development Tower goes up there's not really a next place for us to go. Jack: For many years do you know in Long Island City in app developers are by buildings and tear them down and put up a big tower and there were other places you could go around that and that's get that's becoming harder and harder to do. A because there's less places for artist to go there they're full of artist so there's not a whole lot empty places to go. Leslie: Do you see that being something that might happen here eventually? Jack: You know I would like to think that my current landlord is sympathetic enough to want to preserve the community that he has sort of supported in his building. I think that becomes more and more difficult when the value of the properties in the neighborhood is going up and up and up. You know it's very difficult when the value of what you're somebody will pay is a lot more than what you're getting every year and rent. It becomes a comes a more difficult decision. I think for now I'm okay and I think he's sympathetic to our sir cause but he's also running a business so it might become more difficult . I wanted to make sure to talk about was just in addition to the community that I found is part of Long Island City Art open. You know there was an amazing community of people that live out here that are not particularly artist but see the value of the artist bring to their neighborhoods. They see the you know the cleanup say do the activities they do the benefits you know the fundraisers the end and the value that we bring not necessarily by building buildings, but commitment to the community and sell a lot of our neighbors. A lot of our neighbors who aren’t necessarily artists are very supportive and you know helpful to our causes to try to let you know Preserve. The other thing we were talking about were the places to work out here before the proximity the city is really unbeatable you know the fact that you can get right on the 59th Street Bridge and come right over here and get to the studio is. Part of the attraction for sure you know I mean I'm a huge bike commuter. Leslie: I was just going to ask you how do you normally come into the city. Jack: I’ve been a bike Commuter for many years you know I mean I grew up in town in Manhattan doing a lot of cycling, and so it was very natural for me to ride my bike back and forth from Manhattan to Long Island City. So at least half of the time I come out here I'm on my bike you know I actually keep I don't park your car in the city I keep my car out here. Leslie- Any reason why? Jack: I have a parking spot as part of my lease in my loading dock but it's also much less expensive to have a spot here then on the upper east side. I don’t actually use my car in the city. I take my bike or public transportation. I actually take my kids to school on a bike so I’ll take the kids to school on the bike and then come out here so being able to get back and forth so easily is part of what made it so unbelievably attractive. But you know it really. Jack: The thing that and so for my own sculpture one of the things that I am coming up against as you can see is space and storage. You know like my space is very small it's packed to the gills I have very little room to actually be making a lot of new work and so space is something that I'm really up against now. I have spent many years making what I have now work but I'm at a point where I really need a bigger space because of the pressures on the neighborhood from developers because of the artist being sort of squeezed into smaller and smaller areas because of the value of the properties in the neighborhood it's a very difficult for me to find a bigger space here and so I'm really struggling right now with this. Jack: Idea of where can I go to get a bigger space. unfortunately, it is looking more and more difficult to find something in Long Island City or Queens. I have a few friends that have gone North if you're up into Astoria you know and they've been able to find Space up there. I have had a more difficult time finding space up there because a lot of the people that have been displaced out of Long Island City have gone up into Astoria and so there's also less options there. I'm kind of struggling now where am I going to go and you know maybe if I find a space in the South Bronx you know I'll get more space it'll be less expensive but I'll have to leave this neighborhood I'll have to leave these people have to leave this community and so that is something I don’t really want to do and and then I'm sure fighting and that I want to. Leslie: Hold off as long as possible. Jack: I just it's too big a trade-off at this point you know because the community of artists exist here have become part of my daily routine they have become part of my working life they become people that I collaborate with you know I did a show with a local painter out in Jamaica Queens recently and you know he was showing some work out there and I can talk to the gallery curator and said there's some sculpture that would look great with my drawings and we work together and so you know there's this amazing sense of helping each other which is not what you think of in the art world . You know you think of the art world as this Cutthroat get ahead at any cost Do Your Own Thing don't help anybody else and it's totally the opposite out here in this neighborhood you know. We work with each other we work for each other we help each other we do shows together you know I mean I'll lend my check to somebody to put a show in nearby. I'll come help me put my work in and it becomes this incredibly tight knit creative environment that I'm not sure exists in a whole lot of other places. You know I don’t think it exists in Williamsburg anymore. cuz it's not really a whole lot of working artists down there you know and there are some pockets of Brooklyn where there's lots of really great stuff going on. I don't know that the people in those places have the longevity of a lot of the people here. I mean I know artist should have been out here working as artists in their Studios for 20 or 30 years which is like unheard of and they have a commitment to the neighborhood in a way that I don't see any. Jack: So you know I am currently I'm still in Long Island City I certainly don't want to go anywhere you know I mean I'm trying to find some storage options in the neighborhood that I'm hoping you're going to pan out so that I'll be able to have some more room to work. Yeah you know queens has been incredibly important to the development of my work not just in the strides that I've taken professionally since I've been here working here but it's really the connections in the community that I have become a part of being out here that you were saying away. Leslie: Which is cool because you don’t always think city and the close knit connections. Leslie: Regarding your family when you were going to school and kind of realize that are kind of passion of yours was your family support of that? Was anybody in your family and big art person in general? Jack: So my mom is a journalist. My dad was a book publisher and so you know the Arts were. Certainly supported you know I think you know it wasn't easy you know when I said I wanted to be an artist because it tends to be very difficult to be able to you know do it professionally. Some of those early public sculptures shows, I started working a lot for City governments and so I found a niche in public sculpture where I have work currently all over the country. I’m actually on my way to North Carolina tomorrow to put a sculpture up in Fayetteville North Carolina so I have found a way to be working professionally and making a living and being an artist by pursuing the public sculpture realm. I still do a lot of work for people's homes you know I do private sculptures I do work for galleries but probably 75% of the work I do is with City governments and public art shows. Part that’s what I really like about that is. As I said before you don't you don't have to walk into a gallery instead of Wonder you know do I need to buy anything and you see it on the street you interact with that you put it out in the people's lives in a way that's a lot more approachable and a lot easier for people to come into contact with. So yeah my parents were very supportive of me wanting to be in the arts. Jack: You know as soon as they saw me sort of really decide to do it in a way that was I was really pursuing it you like when I was working for the blacksmith you know they realize that I was trying to gain a deeper understanding the material on so they kind of got that I was also getting paid to make Furniture, so that helped. Then when I was at the arts student league working on figure drawing. They say my style in the understanding so that when I did finish at the arts student league and started making sculpture again very soon thereafter it started to to be recognized started to be display and it started to go in the sculpture parks and started to go into galleries and stuff .so the success that followed a lot of the preparation I did in terms of learning the material and then the subject matter paid off and someone became very clear that I wasn't just kind of like doing it you it half way Leslie: It was very clear that it wasn’t just a passion. Jack: It was sort of a way to connecting the dots to a career which is really good and you know the great thing about it is that you know my two little kids I have an 8-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son and you know they they come out to the studio they know what I do you know they come out here and you know. I teach them to use the tools I let them get dirty and so they also have this connection to the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood because they are a part of it with me and so it's nice to be able to pass that on to them that you know what it isn't just about finding a place to do what it is you want to do but it's finding a community to do what you do and the community around is going to support what you're doing. Leslie: Anything else. Items that you wanted to talk about? Jack: Predictions for change of the next 5 years? Jack: I sort of sort of shudder to think of the next five years in this neighborhood the pace of change seems to be unstoppable. You know buildings are going up around here at frenetic Pace developers are gobbling up land and buildings you know before anybody else gets a chance at them. The prices have gotten so high that it's sort of Untouchable for us everyday artist to even try to think about you know getting a little building or trying to buy something. You know I mean there was a building across the street here that was a 4000 square foot shell with no roof so busy was four walls with no roof and it would have been a beautiful little Studio building and it ended up selling for over 2 million dollars. So you know when it starts to get like that and every day new artists like myself or new artists. Finding a place to work you know I sort of worried about what the future is going to be like out here you know I don't know that the developers have a sense of preserving this amazing Community the doubt hear you know they were. • 37:16 - 37:48 How to build buildings with filament people and go on to the next one so I don't know how much longer the community can survive out here quite frankly. I think it's some point it will be you know completely pushed out by the developers which is sort of you know what always happens you know. It’s what happened in Sao Hollow and it’s what happened in Williamsburg and you know it took a lot longer in Long Island City then I think people thought it would and unfortunately seems like it is going to end up happening so you know where we all go is but good question but, yeah I don't know the future unfortunately doesn't seem like you know all that bright out here for artists for artists for developers it’s different. Leslie: Perfect thank you thank you. ",
  "Howard_Juanita_timecode.txt": "Juanita is long-term resident living in Jamaica, Queens. In this interview, Juanita discusses her experience living in Jamaica, Queens with her family. Her family was very important to her, while growing up in Queens. Juanita discusses memorable times living with her loving family. 00:00:38 Juanita will be talking about her experience when she left West Virginia to come to New York. 00:00:47 Juanita graduated high school at May 1953. She was excited about coming to NYC, her older sisters already lived in NYC, so she didn’t have any trouble on arriving and getting used to the environment. 00:01:18 Juanita stayed in Harlem with her sister, Thelma, and went to Apollo 380 about 3 times a week and saw all kinds of entertainers at midday matinee for $1.25. 00:01:40 Juanita felt like it was her second time growing up from a teenager to an older teenager. She had a wonderful time. 00:01:50 Juanita moved to Queens and stayed with another sister, Mary Delois, and met Leon, her husband in 1954. 00:02:30 After meeting Leon, Juanita dated him about 7-8 months and Leon proposed to her. They wanted to get married; however, she wasn’t old enough. 00:02:50 Since there were no telephone around that time; she sent her letter to West Virginia about her getting married to her parents. 00:03:07 Juanita and Leon went to the County Clerk in Jamaica, Queens and they were turned down because she wasn’t old enough to get married. Her mother went to Mercy County State House and made her a duplicate birth certificate that shows that she is one year older than she originally was and mailed it to her. 00:03:31 Juanita and Leon went back to the Court House and got a marriage license and got married. 00:03:45 Her daughter, Gloria, was born in 1955. 00:04:15 Juanita was working in a factory in Manhattan when she lived with her parents. She worked for a factory that made ladies underwear and it was one of the first job experiences that she had. 00:04:43 After that she worked at the Billable Hour Company, also a factory, however, she couldn’t adjust working in that type of working environment and she decided to do something else. After she quit, she then had Gloria, her daughter, and stayed home until she was able to go to school. 00:05:25 Juanita went to was Antioch Baptist Church. She loved it and was always very active and involved with the church community. 00:05:48 She worked with 2 missionary groups: one was Junior missionary (ages 8-17) and other was the adult missionary group. She was the President for both of the missionary groups. 00:06:11 The adult missionaries would have meetings and Junior Missionaries would have classes. 00:06:25 All through her church life, it’s been about ‘doing and giving’. 00:06:50 After being Missionary President for 18 years, she formed the first women’s fellowship ministry and it was going for about 4 years. 00:07:02 In 1989, she became a Deaconess and she was one of the youngest Deaconess’ in the group. 00:07:18 About 4 years ago, she didn’t quit going to church, she just slowed down with her church activities. 00:07:30 She went to Antioch Baptist church is because her parents went there, her father and mother were Deacons to the church, and Julius Palmer was the chairman of the Deacon board. After Leon and Juanita got married, Leon got baptized there because he saw that the family was church oriented, he wanted to be part of the family. Their children were all batized at Antioch Baptist Church. Part 2 of the interview. 00:09:07 Juanita will now discuss about her siblings and she will name all of Julius Irene Palmer’s children from oldest to youngest. 00:09:35 Julius Irene Palmer’s oldest son was Dolwood Ballard Palmer. He went into the service at age 19 and 20. At September 19, 1944, he went missing in action. 00:10:13 Their mother got the telegram with the news and she was traumatized. Two men came to the door with the telegram that he went missing in action in Germany in 1944. They gave her a Purple Heart. 00:11:24 Dolwood Valet Palmer had come home on his first leave and their mother threw him a huge banquet dinner party in their dining room before he left again to go to action. 00:12:00 After the family heard that Dolwood was missing in action, they never heard anything more. That was the closure on Dolwood Ballard Palmer. 00:12:12 The next oldest was Thelma Matilda (Sister), then Gladys (Sister), Juno Julius Junior (Brother), Elizabeth (Sister), Mary Delois (Sister), Stanley, who died a few days after birth, (Brother), Juanita herself, Bee (Sister), and Josephine (Sister). 00:13:39 Growing up with the older sisters and brothers, Juanita had wonderful time with them in their gorgeous house. Everyone had their own jobs/chores to do. There were 2 bedrooms upstairs; 2 girls in each room. In the living room was a piano which they could practice when they wanted to. Off the living room was sun room parlor where they can sew. They had a beautiful lawn and front porch. They had a balcony and a swing and a sofa on the front porch of the house. 00:15:02 Juanita could only remember beautiful things about her and her family. Growing up, the family had Friday night discussions in a roundtable when they could talk about anything that was bothering them and wanted to express their feelings and opinions. No arguments or fighting, if one of them did anything wrong towards another, they had to apologize immediately. 00:16:10 Juanita and her siblings did a lot of cooking together. Gladys was the ‘chief of the whole clan’; so she acted like a leader and made every decision. They had a lot of oatmeal for breakfast, and when Juanita asked Gladys for sugar, she would give her a sprinkle of sugar and tell her to eat it. But Juanita is glad for her discipline, because it made them respect her. 00:17:29 Juanita is describing her brother, Juno. Juno was a great brother, very spoiled because he was the only boy, and loved sparkling white socks, protected the sisters by fighting anyone that bothered the sisters. He was a great protector. 00:18:45 When Juanita was little, one Christmas day, she was wearing a beautiful snow suit on and had to go up a steep hill to see other neighbors in the neighborhood. When Juanita and Juno were going down the steep hill, Juno used to put her on his shoulders and carried her down the hill. 00:19:21 Liz and Juanita got into all types of underhanded stuff. They would go to the company store and charge things to their uncles’ accounts. 00:20:02 They also charged candy and food on their father’s account, instead of school supplies. When the big bill came due their father didn’t know who charged all that stuff. Then their uncle came by with his bill. She knew they were in trouble. Their father paid all the debt. 0:21:30 Juanita says you don’t change much from childhood to adulthood. She’s happy with herself and had a beautiful childhood. ",

  "Jakulj_Kristijana_timecode.txt": "Kristijana Jakulj was brought up in Split, Croatia. She came to New York in September 2002 on her honeymoon. She and her husband stayed (she likes to say that she�s still on her honeymoon). She a hairstylist and worked flat out for eight years without a vacation, before she was able to return to Croatia for a visit: the emotions of the passed time hit her when the plane touched down. She talks about how she never wanted to be anything but a hairstylist; her memories of the war in Croatia � which did not hit Split hard but did �affect the whole country�; and how her ideal life would be to spend six months of each year in Croatia and the USA. Context of interview: �30th Ave � A year in the life of a street� project (www.30thAve.org). Transcript notes for research My name is Kristijana, I�ve been a hair stylist for the past 20 years. I�ve been working here in this salon [GiGi Salon and Styling Studio] from the very opening in 2005, Christmas time. I do both cut and color. Last year we were voted as the best salon in NYC according to the website City�s Best New York City. I think really what makes it good is the good team that we have. It�s really well organized is the second thing. And the third thing is the good management. This is his [salon owner Ruzdija (Gigi) Dzidzovic�s] only salon. I was six I think and remember telling my mom, I always wanted to cut her hair. And every time we went to the bookstores instead of buying a regular kids book I would always look for something with hair. So my mom was upset because she always wanted me to go into some college or something. In Croatia being a hairstylist isn�t really seen that well. Though the school is much harder than here I would say, it�s four years of school. But I remember when I signed up for this and you had to put down three choices. In case you didn�t get your first choice of subject you had to put down your second and third choice. I just left those blank. And the principle came to me and said what�s going on � I said well if I�m not going to be a hair stylist I�m not going to do anything. What I most enjoy is that it�s like an art, and you make people very happy. I also like working on this street because it�s very inspirational. It�s so nice to know that you�re making someone really happy. I moved to New York in September 2002. Mostly we moved because in Croatia because it was a really bad economy after the war in Croatia. We left Croatia for our honeymoon and never went back. I like to say that I�m still on my honeymoon! We came on 23 September and I started working in a different hair salon on 26th just afterwards. And then I worked with no vacation for eight years. First time I went back to Croatia, it was very emotional. I hadn�t seen my mother or father for all that time. So it was really hard. We had been in touch. It was when we touched down in my city that I started crying because it�s weird but I felt really insecure in my own country. It was like I don�t belong here anymore. It was so weird to hear no English, only my language. And I was catching myself saying �thank you�. I�m from Split, in the North part of Croatia. I come a couple of days ago now from Croatia. Now what�s so weird is that when I�m here I miss Croatia, and when I�m in Croatia I miss America. The ideal will be six months here and six months over there. I was around 15 / 16 years old during the war in Croatia. It didn�t affect so much the part that I�m from but it did affect the whole country. I remember us going to school and then sirens warning us to leave the buildings and go under the ground. And my mom always had the bag of stuff next to her bed. And we had to turn the lights off after 4pm. I just moved in May from the apartment we lived in for eight years, on 30th Avenue and 44th Street. It was very hard to move. We moved because we realized we really didn�t need a two-bedroom apartment and we don�t have people over that much, so we moved to a one bedroom. I�m happy with it now. We live on the same block [street], we just moved from 30th Avenue to 26th Avenue. But for me it was like moving from Croatia to here! It�s a bit quieter where we are now and also you can hear the train every morning. People warned us when we moved there about it, but I really love it. It took a good year to get the salon going. Aveda helped a lot � a lot of clients are drawn by Aveda. That�s what brings new clients in here normally. I may be lucky I don�t really get crazy clients. Now I usually work with my own clients whose hair I have cut for five years or so. GiGi used to own a salon on Columbus Avenue in the city, and Manhattan has a different kind of people. People here are more flexible. It�s different when you pay $600 for color instead of $300 � when you pay $600 you expect to look like a god or whatever. There are a lot of Croatians here, a lot of Croatian bars, restaurants and things. A lot of them are on Broadway. ",

  "Jimenez_Linda_timecode.txt": "Linda is a long-term resident who is living in New York in Astoria. In the Interview, she discussed about the times when she came to New York to start a new life with new people and her daughter. Her friends, family, and religion influenced her life so much which gave her so much hope in her life. She also discussed about how her neighborhood has changed so much till these days and how the Filipino community has been doing in the past and now. 00:01:05 Linda came to New York in 1972 as a tourist and she didn’t know that she was pregnant. Since she was young, she didn’t have any hardships that she had to go through before. 00:01:30 Linda had to raise her daughter by herself. Her husband asked her to come back, but she refused because she wanted to start a new life here in New York for a better living with her daughter. 00:02:02 Linda didn’t feel any emotional pain because she was so focused on work and taking care of her daughter. She was able to provide her with education. 00:03:55 back then, when Linda was still a tourist, she didn’t have any license to work any professional jobs. However, she met with an Italian couple that worked in a beauty parlor and they hired her. She worked there for 15 years. 00:04:23 after that, Linda got her own beauty parlor. Before that, in 1981, she ended up buying a chicken and ribs restaurant in Rego Park. Her chicken and Ribs restaurant was her stepping stone to opening a beauty parlor. 00:05:28 Before Linda made the decision to start a new life in New York, in the Philippines, she was a make-up artist. Back then, going to New York was easy, because it was right before the Marshall Law took place. 00:08:30 when she moved in with a roommate in Elmhurst, her roommate didn’t like it if her baby was crying, so Linda was in depression. However, there was a kind family that helped her out and let her stay with them until she found a new place to live. 00:10:45 she had her baby in December 10. 00:11:55 back then, there weren’t as much Filipinos in New York. When she lived with the family in their apartment, she used to do everyone’s hair. Linda was a hustler; she did home service, manicure, pedicure, perm, and other things. 00:13:05 Linda had very good customers. When she got paid, she never wanted to take a cab, or bus, because she thinks that she might leave her child. The child was never problem for her; when she was working, she was always in her room and doing her own things and not bothering Linda, her mother. 00:13:38 Linda’s first impression of New York City was that when she was looking at the trees in New York, she thought about what was so nice about New York. She misses her family in the Philippines and wants to help her family out. It wasn’t for her daughter; she probably would have gone back to the Philippines. 00:14:47 Linda had a nice boss back then who treated her like a family which was the Italian couple she met before. She was devoted to them for about 15 years. 00:16:37 Linda was not part of any religious communities back then; she met a lot of people though. 00:18:55 Linda was part of the Santa Minio, but she wasn’t part of it for that long. 00:25:11 Linda stayed at Lefrak City for 2 months. She brought her roommate who kicked her out and her friends were mad at her for bringing her. Linda told them she was kind enough to let her stay and her friends told her that she still kicked her out. 00:26:51 the father of her daughter got married. Linda went to the wedding and she met with a photographer, who became her husband. 00:28:11 Linda and her husband went out for a while. But they didn’t get married until 1981. After she left Lefrak City, Linda went to Sunnyside. 00:28:44 Linda stayed at Sunnyside for about 20 years or more. 00:31:06 Linda and her husband wanted a house that was offered by their neighbor doctor in the late 80s but it was too expensive for them. They first gave it up, until the neighbors came up to them again and made an offer to sell the house for a cheaper house. However, they couldn’t make that deal because they couldn’t zone Linda’s beauty parlor. Later on, Linda got a phone call from her lawyer and they approved her deal and they bought their house in a cheaper price that was offered before. 00:36:17 her husband is now self-employed, they don’t have much money in the bank, and now their rent is too low, so they couldn’t get the mortgage. 00:36:55 Linda’s friend (her lawyers secretary, Chinese) became a mortgage manager at a Greek Bank. Friend helped her apply and secure a mortgage. 00:37:39 Linda believes that God (Mama Mary) is the one who planned this for her and offered her so many opportunities for a good life. 00:38:06 When Linda was at Sunnyside before, there was a religious Filipino community there that she used go to. It was first religious community that she joined. When she went to the religious community, she met her first best friend, Jacobi there, which was the cousin of her roommate. She admires her so much because she went through so much hardship; she was diagnosed with diabetes, and she became blind before, but she eventually went through procedure and she was able to see once again. 00:40:30 when Jacobi got better, she went back to her religious group. Linda went to the religious group as well, and that is when she started to get interested in being part of the religious group. They first went Linda’s house and go there every Sunday and praise together because they were a small group until later, their group started to gain more members, they went back to their church. Even till this day, they go to Church every Sunday. 00:48:11 Linda started working in Astoria since 1972, and she started her business in 1987. 00:48:37 Linda’s neighborhood has changed a lot before. Originally, there used to be a lot of Italian and Irish people in the neighborhood, but mostly these days, there has been a lot of Greek people. A lot of young professional people that lived in Manhattan now live in her neighborhood too, because Manhattan has been becoming more expensive lately. 00:49:25 there isn’t that much Filipino community in her neighborhood before, but now they have a few people in her neighborhood. There are more Filipino people in Jackson Heights and Woodside now. 00:51:02 her life before Marshall Law happened wasn’t that bad. But when Marshall Law did happen, it was terrible. 00:52:31 Linda is glad that she was able to find a job from her bosses and friends. Since Marshall was happening, it is really difficult to find a job now. 00:55:17 Linda’s favorite memory from working in her beauty Parlor is her customers. Her customers were like her family; she treated them as a family member. They used to feed her customers too, since there was a kitchen upstairs in her beauty parlor. 00:57:00 her husband was a businessman and Linda was just a worker. After he passed away, Linda had a difficult time dealing with the financial issues because her husband did it for her. Her husband did everything for Linda and her daughter; he tried his best to make them happy. 01:02:35 Linda has two sisters; she is the youngest one out of all of them. She is glad that she came to New York so that she could help them out. Her father and mother passed away. 01:04:41 throughout the years, Linda has met a lot of people in different communities. She made a lot of friends in her religious community. 01:11:12 the lesson that Linda wants to share is that we have to let go a lot of resentment to live in a peaceful way. We have to forgive and love you, other people and God. Linda doesn’t worry about what other people say. ",

He got married in 1974. He has one daughter living in the US and his eldest son lives in India. He came to the US in 2010 after his daughter applied for an immigrant visa for him and his wife. He had always wanted to come to America but did not enjoy America at first because he did not have much to do. Later as he engaged with other Indian, Punjabi, and Tibetan members of his community in Sunnyside he feels much better. He does not do any work as of now, but spends his days at his son-in-law�s gas station and his friends perfume shop. He also describes religious places in India that he has visited with friends. 00:00:43: He passed high school in India and continued to college but did not complete college.

His father had his own business but soon divided the business and Joginder�s children grew up within the business as well. Married in 1974. 00:03:35: Joginder always wanted to come and live in the US. Joginder�s sister lived in Chicago but never applied for the immigrant visa for him.

Sometimes as he is walking in Sunnyside, he can bump into Indian or Punjabi people. He can recognize them by the turban they wear. Sometimes if they know Bengali or Hindi, they can still communicate and they can relate. On his way to the interview, he got lost and was able to get directions from a man who spoke Hindi. He usually guesses by looking at the face if they can speak Hindi or not. 00:07:15: When he goes to parks in Sunnyside, there are a lot of people from Tibet there that speak Punjabi. When he and his wife first came to the US in 2012, he and his wife were sitting in a park and a Tibit lady sat next to them and started speaking to them in Punjabi. From going to the park they met and became friends with about 20 families. 00:09:00: The culture here is very sweet, if you ask anyone and let them know that you know little English, they talk to you very nicely and speak slowly and politely to you. In Chicago, there are also Punjabi and Gujrati people just like in New York. 00:11:27: Joginder�s son in law has a gas station. To pass his time he goes to the gas station. Other than that he doesn�t do any work. His children did not go to school here, they grew up in India , married, then moved to the US. His son in law also drives a cab. 00:13:47: At first, he didn�t like being in the US, he would just sit in the house and watch TV. He wasn�t able to find work because most people want strong young men for work. He then went to India for 2 years. Now he feels much better than before. He passes time with his Indian friends. He has a friend in Sunnyside who sells perfume and he sits with him sometimes and passes time. 00:16:40: he enjoys all religions and thinks that God created all people the same way and equally. He attends an Indian temple in Woodside on 56th street. They do poojas (prayers) at home here and the children sometimes play with the firecrackers for celebrations.

In India you can�t say hello or good morning to others, but here you are able to do that. 00:20:30: once in Chicago, he was walking with his friend. Behind them, two bicyclists were heading towards them. He moved to the side for them, and they said thank you to him and he also said thank you to them. 00:22:22: in the parks that he attends, there are a lot of Bengalis and Pakistanis, but not a lot of Indians. Through these park meetings he has made friends and sometime they invite each other for homemade food. There are a lot of Tibet people who have their own stories and own businesses and they also speak Hindi. They watch Hindi movies and that is how they know the language 00:26:06: He doesn�t have any of his close friends in the US, they are all in India. Photograph of Manikar: Manikar is a religious place in India. It is special because there is a river with cold water, by it there is water that is very hot and steamy. People put a bag of rice in that water and in 10 minutes the rice is ready. No one knows where this hot water comes from, comes from the ground. The weather there is very cold and they have to wear good shoes because of the cold. In Dheradhun, there is water that comes from the mountain, and people who are sick go there to bathe in that water and they become better. 00:32:00: He misses India a lot because his sons and his grandchildren are there. Here everyone is busy and working. In India, people have more time and the women don�t work they stay home and cook while the men work. He likes here any people can talk to one another, but in India many people can�t talk to one another because of the Caste system. There is more freedom here than in India. ",

She discusses neighborhood and population change, its impact on her own life and Flushing more broadly. 00:00 Introduction, Carole was born at Flushing Hospital in 1940. 00:42 Describes her earliest memory of being in her apartment house and seeing shops outside. 1:45 Discusses her parents� backgrounds � when they moved to Flushing and where they lived. 2:47 Carole�s maternal grandparents were from Russia, her paternal grandparents were from Hungary. Her paternal grandparents originally lived in Flushing on Bowne Street and later moved to Miami Beach, Florida. Carole�s parents met each other at a single�s event hosted by the synagogue Temple Gates of Prayer. Temple Gates hosted the event in their old location on Roosevelt Avenue, Flushing. Carole lived three blocks of her mother after she got married. Unfortunately, her Dad passed away a few months after her wedding. Her children grew up closer with their grandmother and their uncle (Carole�s brother). Carole�s brother assisted her in locating an apartment for her when she decided to move back from Long Island. 3:28 She describes her younger brother. 3:43 Continues talking about her apartment house; It was built in 1922, and she lived there from 1940 until 1969 when she got married. She then lived on Sanford Avenue from 1969 to 1991 with her husband and two daughters. 4:40 Her children were born 1974 and 1976 in Flushing. 5:03 She discusses how long she has lived in Queens. She lived six years in Patchogue, Long Island, where she owned a private house. She moved back to Flushing when her husband was involved in a major car accident on Long Island. Carole took driving lessons after the accident but found it too traumatic to drive a car. She quotes this as one of her reasons why she moved to back to the exact same building she grew up in Flushing. 5:58 She went to the original P.S. 20, and graduated in 1953. She then attended Flushing High School and graduated in 1957. 7: 12 Explains what she did for fun � spent time with friends, roller-skating, biking, and her dad would drive them to museums, the zoo, and Rockaway Beach. Carole went to the movies at the Prospect Theater on Main Street Flushing on Saturdays, with her friends or brother. They often showed cartoons and other movies. The theater is no longer in existence. The RKO Keith's on Northern Blvd, in downtown Flushing was another movie theater that Carole went to. The theater was landmarked and damaged by a builder who wanted to construct condos in 1986. Several buyers are looking into building on the property now, and have promised to retain the building�s historic lobby. 7:52 She discusses going to the beach, noting a special road near John F. Kennedy Airport where planes came close to the ground. 8:39 Her own kids� childhoods: The family had a car, so they were able to visit her in-laws and cousins on Long Island. She discusses the generations of her family that lived in Flushing. Carole�s maternal grandmother lived across the hall from her � and visiting was always fun. Carole and husband took her children to Long Island to visit their paternal grandparents and cousins. Their Grandma always made Thanksgiving dinner and Passover Seder. She and her children got to spend time with their grandfather and cousins. The holiday meals became a family tradition. 10:21 The historical significance and landmark status of areas/buildings in Flushing, including the Free Synagogue of Flushing, Bowne House, Quaker Meeting House, the RKO Theatre and the Queens Historical Society. 13:10 She outlines Flushing borders. Discusses her grandfather�s fabric store on Main St, which no longer exists. 14:55 Carole details her experiences spending time in the fabric store. 16:05 Carole�s father was a salesman at a men�s clothing store in Manhattan. 16:46 Her mother worked in the fabric shop, and was later a saleswoman in Bedroom Ensembles at Bloomingdale�s in Manhattan. She had to return to work when her husband � my father passed away. 18:02 Her brother was also a salesman of multiple things. One example she gave was selling industrial hardware to elevator manufacturers. 18:50 Carole worked at the Queens Historical Society (brings out the newsletter she typed). She also worked at the Flushing Library, and when her children were in school she worked for the PTA and was editor of the school paper (brings out copies of the paper, and awards she had won for her service). One of her proudest achievements was that she initiated playground repairs at P.S. 20 by writing to a state senator to ask that repairs be made (brings out before and after photos of playground). 24:31 After graduating from college, Carole�s older daughter worked as an editor for True Story Magazine, which is now out of business. Her youngest daughter continued to work in advertising after her graduation and marriage. Her youngest daughter has two young boys. (goes through several documents she brought to show me � photographs, newsletters) 25:52 Love of writing 27:17* Carole used to attend services at the Free Synagogue of Flushing. As a child she went for religious instruction on Sundays, her daughters celebrated their Bat Mitzvah�s there. Membership has declined over the years; she now observes holidays at home. It has gone through major changes, and because it�s an open space for prayer, a lot of the people who go there are not Jewish. Old members have passed away, moved, or stopped going. 33:00 Carole started noticing a change in the late 1990s, when she returned from Long Island. The immigrant population had built up Flushing from its run down character when she left. 33:34 Discusses the difficulties of transportation on Long Island. 34:19 Other major changes in the neighborhood are the number of people. It�s a convenient area with bus lines and subways, banks, and shops. Vehicular and sidewalk traffic are overwhelming. 36:49 Most of the businesses she once knew in the area are no longer there. She describes her social activities, including the botanical gardens. Her old high school friends moved out to Long Island. Unfortunately they won�t come to visit her in Flushing because street parking is very difficult in Flushing. 38:20 She is now on the board of directors for her co-op and takes meeting minutes. She discusses why people move to Flushing. 39:25 She talks more about neighborhood change, and notes that she doesn�t miss what she doesn�t have. 40:54 Carole went to the 1964/65 New York World�s Fair, but wouldn�t go to Flushing Meadows � Corona Park now. There�s no need to. The only area she goes to is the Botanical Gardens, and praises security. 42:10 Discusses displays at the World�s Fair. She mentions recent renovations on former World�s Fair structures and transportation to the park. She remembers Belgian Waffles, the futuristic aspect of the fair, and television. After the fair, she would only return a couple of times; the Queens Zoo was there. 46:35 Discusses other parks in the area - Bowne Park and Kissena Park. Carole recalls visiting Martin�s Field via bus with her mother and brother. Occasionally her father would drive them there on the weekends. Martin�s Field also known as Olde Towne Park had a playground when she was younger. Martin�s Field wading pool was fun to use in the summer. There was a big renovation in 2004, which was completed in 2008. Carole found out that the Park used to be a Native American and African American burial site. 47:07 She returns to her daughters and discusses their college experience and life since then. 49:41 The meaning of Flushing: For Carole, Flushing means community, and family stories. The population keeps growing, and she describes the characters you see on the sidewalks. 52:21 end of interview, she brings out more photos and old documents until end of recording. ",
  "Kaiser_Mary_timecode.txt": "Mary Kaiser moved to the Waldheim neighborhood to live with her father, aunt, and uncle after her mother�s death in the 1920�s. Her father was a conductor and later a supervisor for the MTA. Her uncle had a pony farm on their property and offered rides to children in the neighborhood. When her uncle died in the middle of the Great Depression, Mary�s aunt sold the ponies and began renting out stalls in the barn as parking spots for cars. This rent was a large part of the family�s income and a business that Mary conducted at the time of this interview. She went to Public School 24 on Robinson Street and remembered going as a child to see it built. She graduated from high school in 1940 and married a WWII veteran who had been her friend�s neighbor in College Point. Her friend had encouraged her to write to him while he served in the South Pacific and despite never having met him in-person back at home, she did. They did meet once he returned and eventually married and had three children they raised in a home they built on her family�s property in Flushing.

  "Kalasapudi_Lakshman_timecode.txt": "Lakshman Kalasapudi was born in the Bronx on September 21, 1990. His family moved to the Floral Park/Glen Oaks section of Queens in 1994. Both parents were born in India and are medical doctors. They moved to Queens to work at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center (now called Northwell Health) in New Hyde Park. There is a large South Asian population in this area of Queens. Lakshman has played a leadership role in the South Asian and LGBTQ communities. He serves on the Board of Directors of the South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association of New York City (SALGA) and works at India Home, which provides culturally appropriate services to South Asian seniors living in Queens. 00:00:00 This is a Queens Memory Project interview for Lakshman Kalasapudi at 67-71 Yellowstone Blvd., Forest Hills, New York on February 4, 2018 at 3:07 PM. 00:01L03 Lakshman was born in the Bronx and raised in Queens. His parents moved to Queens in 1994. Both parents were from the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Both parents were from very small-town, rural-village settings. His mother (Vasundhara Devi Kalasapudi), came from a village outside of a town called Saluru, his father (Srinivasa Kalasapudi Rao), came from Bobbili. These were neighboring towns. Lakshman�s parents went to school together. That is how they met. They fell love and got married. This is unusual, as many traditional Indian marriages are arranged. 00:02:08 Both parents studied in Visakhapatnan, which is third-tier Indian City. His mother completed her medical degree and MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery � from the British educational system). His father completed a bachelor�s and master�s degree in science. They were married in Hyderabad which is a bigger city. His father started his Ph.D. there, but that program did not work out. He then applied for, and received, a scholarship to complete a Ph.D. program in Paris (Universite Paris Descartes). His parents were married, and his father left for Paris (1984). 00:02:52 Lakshman�s sister was born in India soon after this. His mother lived with her parents before joining his father in Paris in 1985. Lakshman�s parents lived in Paris until 1988. In 1988, his father came to Albert Einstein College of Medicine to complete a post-doctoral program. The family lived on Rhinelander Avenue in the Bronx. 00:03:42 Lakshman�s mother also completed a post-doc while she was in Paris and at Albert Einstein Hospital. Lakshman was born at Jack D. Weiler Hospital in 1990. His father then received a professorship at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, that is now called Northwell Health. 00:04:14 The family then moved near the hospital, on the boarder of Long Island and Queens. There are different names for this area: Floral Park, New Hyde Park, and Glen Oaks. Lakshman was four years old when the family moved there. 00:04:58 According to Lakshman, Glen Oaks is great place to raise your kids. It is a very family-oriented neighborhood. When the family first moved to the area (Floral Park), it was predominantly Jewish and Christian. At some point in the 1990�s, it became heavily South Asian. Lakshman does not remember the change, as it was always that way when he was growing up. 00:05:42 Lakshman started elementary school in 1995. He attended PS 115, now called the James J. Ambrose School, from 1995-2001. Lakshman thinks that by 2000, 50 percent of the school was South Asian. 00:06:09 South Asians are a very heterogeneous and diverse population. There are Hindus, Malayali Christians, and Punjabi Sikhs. These are all different languages, cultures, and religions. There was always a huge mix of South Asians. 00:06:41 What drew South Asians to the neighborhood, similar to his family, was the hospital (Long Island Jewish). South Asians are residents, physicians, scientists, and nurses. And then other South Asians followed because they felt comfortable moving to the area. 00:07:04 The area was affordable by New York City standards. Many residents commute to Manhattan via the Q46 if they are on Union Turnpike or the Q43 if they are on Hillside Ave. Then they take the trains into the City. 00:07:26 Floral Park was a great neighborhood. Lakshman�s family lived on 265th Street (76-22 265th Street) in a single-family home from 1994 to 2002. Then his parents purchased a larger house in Roslyn Heights, a few miles away on Long Island. However, the New Hyde Park/Bellerose/Floral Park/Glen Oaks area was always the main hub in terms of groceries and social networks. In 2009, his parents sold the house in Roslyn Heights and moved back to 260th Place (69-55 260th Place, Glen Oaks) in the Royal Ranch section, near North Shore Towers. 00:08:12 Lakshman went to college at Hunter College and then received his master�s degree. In 2014, he moved back home to help his mother. He is now living with his parents on 260th Place. 00:08:32 Floral Park was a very suburban neighborhood and a great place to raise kids. Glen Oaks Village, which is a co-op, village-type set up, has a court-yard structure so it was a very safe place for children to play. There were a lot of families with children. There was green space and parks. Lakshman could ride his bicycle all over the neighborhood. 00:09:18 There have not been many changes to the neighborhood since Lakshman was a child. Some Indians are building McMansions. (His family is living in one.) These houses change the visual character of the neighborhood. There was some resentment by the white Christian and Jewish population about South Asians moving in. Now the South Asians are resentful of the blacks moving in. More African Americans are moving in because it is a good neighborhood to raise children. There are now a few homeless people in the neighborhood, so there are some subtle changes. But it is a solidly middle-class area. 00:10:35 Lakshman then talked about being gay in that neighborhood. He said it is very family oriented, heteronormatively oriented. Because of the kinds of ethnicities and communities settling there, being gay is not �a thing for him� in the neighborhood. He does appreciate it when it comes up! Lakshman has seen some gay people on grindr. In fact, Lakshman just discovered that an older couple, living in the house behind his house, have a gay son living in Brooklyn. They bonded over the fact that they were gay and neighbors, but there is not much of a gay community in the area. 00:11:52 Lakshman was happy when he thought the Long Island Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Network had opened the Queens Lesbian and Gay Community (Q Center) at the Samuel Field Y, off Little Neck Parkway. However, when he went to the Samuel Field Y, nobody knew where it was. The Q Center eventually opened in Long Island City which was disappointing. Lakshman wishes it had been closer to the suburban Queens area. 00:13:05 Lakshman mentioned that �lesbian and gay� are terms from the 1980�s and are not as relevant today. There are many more identities. Lakshman tries to brand SALGA (South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association of New York City) as an LGBQT organization to be more inclusive. It is a volunteer community group which was started in 1991 by South Asians who needed to connect as sexual minorities. It is an all-volunteer collective. SALGA provides a peer, mental health support group once a month, political actions, and assistance to community members needing asylum, and social and economic supports. It is a place where Queens South Asians can feel safe and validated. It is a place to express both identities together � gay and South Asian - and not bifurcate the two identities. 00:14:32 Lakshman came out when he was in high school (2006). It was fine. His parents raised him �very Indian� but not in conventional ways. It was not religious, but very civic oriented. The core culture of Telugu, his family�s ethnicity and language, was very present. Lakshman mentioned that a lot of second- generation Telugu raised in American can�t speak the language, but he and his sister can do so. 00:15:40 When Lakshman came out (2006), he googled �Indian and gay in NYC� and SALGA came up. He went to his first support group, in September 2007, just before he turned 17. The main way to connect with SALGA is through the support group. SALGA is housed in the LGBT Center in Manhattan on 13th Street in Chelsea. He went to a few more support group meetings and marched in his first Manhattan LGBT Pride March with SALGA in 2008. It was a mind-blowing experience for him. 00:16:38 In 2008, Lakshman moved to 25th Street (425 E 25th Street) to the Hunter dorms. SALGA needed new leadership and new members. He decided to jump in even though he was just 18 and most everyone else was in their 30�s and 40�s. He was on the SALGA Steering Committee from 2008 to 2010. 00:17:23 SALGA issues are always about visibility and the perennial problem of coming out. People who came to SALGA in 1991 and will come to SALGA in 2021 have the same issues. It is always going to be difficult to come out. This difficulty needs to be acknowledged, validated, helped, and appreciated. According to Lakshman, in the past 10 years, the issue of visibility has changed a lot for queers in general - for example, doing drag in saris, being queer and South Asian, and being South Asian in LGBTQ spaces, which are often very white dominated. 00:18:28 Lakshman would like to think that this is not an issue for young, queer South Asians. They are in their own queer, South Asian bubble and don�t feel a need to engage. That is a good and bad thing. Many SALGA Steering Committee members are first generation and still very close to their own country. Homeland politics also informs SALGA�s work. 00:20:24 In 2009, the Delhi Supreme Court struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (copied the British penal code) outlawing acts of sodomy and �sexual acts against the order of nature�. This was a big win for allies back in India. This was an important issue for SALGA. 00:20:01 Another issue SALGA addressed was protesting and advocating to march in the India Day Parade (celebrating Indian independence, occurs every August). Through the 1990�s, the Federation of Indians in America (FIA), the governing body for the Parade, banned SALGA. SALGA marched with SAKHI (a domestic violence organization for South Asian survivors) and other times protested the parade. In 2009, with support from Senator Tom Dwayne and Councilmembers Christine Quinn and Danny Dromm, SALGA did march. 00:21:13 SALGA�s main activities are providing spaces where people can come and connect with others with similar experiences. 00:21:34 SALGA has always had a reputation as being the more privileged sector of the community. SALGA members speak English, are very well educated, come from upper-caste or upper-class families, and are upwardly mobile. There is a disconnect with the bread and butter communities that live in the outer boroughs. 00:22:22 There are a lot of men who have sex with men (who may or may not be gay identified), trans folks, women, working class immigrants, non-English speakers, the undocumented, and people with socio-economic vulnerabilities whom SALGA has not always been able to bridge. In some respects, it is a good that SALGA is Manhattan based. It is easy for everyone to come from the outer-boroughs, as well as Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey - the Tri-State area. It offers anonymity. If SALGA had an event in Jackson Heights (did try to do that) no one would come. 00:23:25 Lakshman commented that If you are born and raised in Jackson Heights and your entire social network is there, you are worried that family members will see you walking up the stairs of Queens Pride House on 37th Ave. Even making that step, knowing that it is your neighborhood, is kind of hard. 00:24:15 For example, if the Queens Pride Center was on Hillside Ave. and Little Neck Parkway. This area is very hard-core South Asian. Lakshman is known there for his work in the South Asian community. But he is not fully out, although it might be implied. If he is asked, he would not say no. But he is not waving the Pride flag in that context. A few years ago, he would have had trepidation to step into that. Now at 28 years old, he is doing better. 00:25:11 Lakshman stepped off the SALGA Board in 2010. In 2012, he graduated from Hunter College and went to Winnipeg for a master�s degree in anthropology. He came back to NYC in the fall of 2014. He was still working on this master�s degree. By November 2015, SALGA needed more Steering Committee members, so he stepped in again. He still serves on the Steering Committee. He will leave in May 2018, when he leaves NYC. 00:25:56 Lakshman will be moving to Baltimore. He is trying to get accepted to medical school. 00:26:10 Lakshman is not a member of any other gay organizations. Lakshman talked about his privilege and insularity. Growing up in a South Asian area, his family did not give up their culture. They assimilated only to the degree they needed to. Lakshman feels connected to the villages his family comes from. He has a sense of responsibility to where his family came from. 00:27:23 According to Lakshman, insularity is not always a good thing. Because the South Asian community in New York is very small, you run into same people. He thinks he should branch out but is not sure how to do that. The main-stream gay organizations are very white. The people of color, gay organizations are usually black or Latino. But the experience of being a person of color and a child of immigrant is different. Lakshman supports these organizations but does necessarily connect to them culturally. 00:28:31 Lakshman currently works at India Home. India Home provides culturally appropriate services to South Asian seniors living in Queens. His mother started the organization. She did so because she could not bring her parents to the United States, due to the lack of culturally appropriate medical services for older South Asian adults (2005, 2006). She had observed this issue with her family friends as well. She got fed up with the situation. She was a revolutionary in India. She was part of the Communist Party in India and almost had to go underground. 00:29:40 Something inspired her, and she said, �we have to do something�. She started India Home with her friends. She did not know what she was getting into. In 2014, the organization was experiencing a lot of growth. Lakshman had worked in non-profits, and his mother said his help was needed. Lakshman agreed to help. Lakshman had been active in the South Asian community. And, she could not afford any one else! The people working there are very poorly paid. Lakshman helped grow the organization, with his mother�s leadership. 00:30:52 India Home administers case management services, mental health counseling, and dementia services. It has grown a lot in the last few years. It is the �called upon� agency that provides senior services in a culturally appropriate manner through an immigrant lens. India Home only provides senior services. All the seniors are immigrants and is a very heterogeneous population. 00:31:42 The main office is located in Jamaica Estates. There are sites in Jamaica, Sunnyside, Kew Gardens, and Richmond Hill. 00:32:04 Lakshman stated that Queens is a great place to raise your kids and very family oriented. That is why a lot of South Asians moved to Queens. It is very affordable and very safe. A number of South Asians have moved to Queens and aged there. A number of South Asian working adults have brought their parents to Queens as older adult immigrants. 00:32:56 Unfortunately, there is a lot of market rate housing and a lot of overcrowding. The houses of worship and grocery stores are the main draws. Lakshman thinks he would like to live in a gay neighborhood, maybe, but he would need an Indian grocery store! Each neighborhood has a pocket where older adults feel most comfortable. 00:33:34 Lakshman is not sure if he would go to SAGE or India Home when he is older. He knows two older SALGA members who go to the LGBT Center, not India Home. He knows that many South Asians are not accepting of LGBT people, even people his age. Creating safe spaces and culture of acceptance is not yet where it should be. 00:34:56 SALGA members who are undocumented or seeking asylum are a little more apprehensive because of Trump. The good thing about NYC is the possibility of being connected to some kind of community. Because the South Asian community in NYC is so insular, it can cocoon you. A lot of people are feeling a lot of tension with Trump and xenophobia, but it is possible to forget about it. The day to day of the community always goes on, such as religious festivals and family gatherings. 00:36:34 Lakshman mentioned that South Asian communities in Texas for example, are more at threat, than in NYC. But on the Q43, going to Bellerose, in the heart of Queens, a young woman�s Hajib was violently ripped off. However, ideally there are more community supports for recourse. Because of Mayor De Blasio, the City government is very present in everyone�s lives. The City was not so integrated in the community under Bloomberg. Trump is a lightning rod for City agencies to declare their support for immigrants, queers, women and all other communities. There is that reassurance and commitment to hard-to-reach communities on the City level. 00:38:18 Lakshman stated that Danny Dromm has been great. He was a teacher, then decided to go into politics. Danny (Dromm) is not in it for himself. Many of the NYC councilmembers are from the community and that commands a lot of respect. Danny (Dromm) is committed to recognizing himself as white man and is committed to all the communities in Queens. Lakshman thinks it is hard to find someone so self-aware and such a great ally. Danny (Dromm) is cognizant of the lay of land in Queens and constantly makes space for �people like us�. According to Lakshman, the only reason there is not enough visibility for people of color on the Queens level, is they are not able to fulfill that capacity. Danny (Dromm) gives these communities a wide birth and they are not able to fulfill this. 00:40:05 Lakshman first met Danny (Dromm) when his mother went to lobby the councilmember for discretionary funds for India House. Lakshman said he should go because he is gay, and that thing works! Danny (Dromm) is a huge supporter of SALGA and India Home. He recognizes the need for these organizations. He always tries to rope in SALGA and the South Asian community. For example, when Lavender Lines opened at the Queens Museum, Danny (Dromm) asked, �Where is the SALGA dance team?� Danny remembers Lakshman and that is amazing because he knows so many people. Lakshman thinks he is doing really well as a councilmember and the City needs more people like him. Having someone like Danny Dromm in the council seat makes a difference. He is literally funding programs and saying you have to be on the stage to get that visibility. These are the narratives that are important. It is top down, but when you have good people at the top, it is ok. 00:42:32 Lakshman said that his mother was very important to his work. The amount of energy she has, and the practicality of her work, is very inspirational. That is one of the reasons he is going into medicine. 00:43:15 In terms of the LGBT community, Urvashi Vaid, a lawyer by training, has been very inspirational to Lakshman. Urvashi is his mother�s age and came to America when she was 11 years old. Her parents were highly educated. They came in the 1960�s, the first wave from India. She grew up in NY. She and Lakshman have met once or twice. He attended her lecture at the Kessler Lecture (CLAGS � Center for LGBTQ Studies) at CUNY. She was the Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1989 to 1992. Lakshman imagines her life as a queer South Asian woman who made her mark in the mainstream LGBTQ community back in the 1980�s and 1990�s. Race has been on her mind. Her Kessler lecture, in 2011, was about race in the LGBTQ movements. Urvashi is such a strong figure in the mainstream LGBTQ movements. She is in a position of power that she has accumulated over decades of hard work, which is very inspirational. 00:46:05 Generally, the most inspiring people to Lakshman are women. They do the most work in the community. Woman do all the movement work � the gay men just want to party! He has a family friend (a woman) running for the State Assembly in Michigan. Pauline Park, is a transgender, Korean adoptee, activist, who lives in Queen. 00:47:39 Lakshman thinks that in the future, there should be more community institutions. People in the South Asian community need help from direct services across all fronts. Everyone needs more services. Lakshman is in the mind-set that what is needed are more community centers, more community spaces, and more affordable housing. It would also be good to have healthy assimilation and integration. Lakshman understands why people can be very insular (he is that way himself) but that is not always healthy. Not everyone wants to be more integrated, but he believes more integration would behoove the community. It is happening somewhat with trailblazers like Urvashi. 00:49:40 Lakshman does not believe that this integration necessarily happens with the younger generation. Lakshman knows a number of South Asians, born and raised like him, who only talk to other South Asians. This orientation will not disappear with the generation. Many families who left India in the 1800�s, lived in Guyana and came to Queens, still only marry Guyanans. 00:50:33 His hope for the community is that when people need help, they can get it. He hopes they can do better creating community institutions. He also hopes that Queens is saved from gentrification. 00:51:03 Queens is where it all happens. It is a social geography, physically it is all about Queens. Lakshman has put 60,000 miles on his car, in the last three years, driving in Queens. Lakshman hopes Queens stays as it is. It is a great place to raise a family. He loves that the gay bar scene in Jackson Heights is entirely Latino. 00:52:08 Ideally, Lakshman hopes there would be more community spaces and community centers. But on the whole, there are a lot of great things happening in Queens. He would like to come back here to start a clinic or practice here. He was shadowing a doctor, who was an Indian immigrant, and all her patients were immigrants from different countries. It was beautiful. 00:52:59 Lakshman has one hope that Queens could be a little more queer, with more community institutions and services in Eastern and Southern Queens. These areas often get the short end of the stick and that is not fair. It would be good if the roads could get a little better. As long as we remember all the places in Queens and strengthen them all with community institutions, Queens will be just fine. It is a great place. 00:53:45 Lakshman�s pipe dream for his medical career is to start a South Asian federally qualified health center. (There is not one yet.) He would like to do a private practice that does social services. He will do internal medicine and psychiatry because mental health and behavioral health are so intertwined. Mental health is on the top of the list of needs. When he gets older, he wants to build a house back in his family�s village in India and set up a practice. 00:54:58 Lakshman stated that in Queens, there is a narrative and history beyond each door (in this coop building for example), and this is just one building in Forest Hills. There are so many fascinating people here and it is so unassuming. This is different from Manhattan, where xyz lives here, and abc lives there, and they have accomplished so much. Lakshman is very grateful that the Queens Memory Project is recording these oral histories and he will recommend more people. Queens did not come out of nothing. People worked to build community institutions and neighborhoods. They are not perfect people, but their stories deserve to be remembered and celebrated. 00:56:23 The Queens Memory Project interview for Lakshman Kalasapudi ended at 4:01 PM. It was conducted at 67-71 Yellowstone Blvd., Forest Hills, New York on February 4, 2018. ",
  "Kam_Kaleena_timecode.txt": "Kaleena was born in 1960s and migrated from Hong Kong with her family in 1984. She and her family lived in Woodside, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Briarwood, and Rego Park. She attended William Cullen Bryant High School, Polytechnic Institute, and Hunter College. Her family chose to live in Queens so that they can be closer to their relatives, who at the time also lived in Queens. While her family and she moved from one neighborhood to another for a bigger living quarter, she noticed the difference between the neighborhoods they lived in, as well as the increasing Chinese immigrant population in Queens. 00:01:00 Kaleena and her six family members lived in a studio in Woodside, including her parents, and four siblings. She attended William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City. 00:02:03 She talks about getting used to life in New York, such as language barrier in school but slowly adjust to her new life. 00:03:01 Kaleena talks about her school life at William Cullen Bryant High School as an ESL student and a new immigrant. No Chinese teachers at the school at the time. Classmates were different for every class. 00:04:20 Neighborhood in Woodside, living near Woodside and rent was around $500 for a studio. Parents worked at a sweatshop in Chinatown. 00:05:34 Kaleena�s mother brought grocery in Chinatown at the end of the day after work. 00:05:48 The family moved into Elmhurst for a bigger apartment with one bedroom after six years in 1990. 00:06:24 Kaleena describes the neighborhood in Elmhurst. There are more people in Elmhurst compare to Woodside because there are more shops around. The apartment they rent was located between Roosevelt Avenue and 82nd street. It was near the 7 train. 00:07:00 Queens as first destination and choice of settlement because relatives also live in Queens. 00:07:13 After living in Elmhurst for two years, Kaleena�s older brother brought a one family residential house with three bedrooms in Jackson Heights and the family moved in. The house costed between $100,000 to $200,000 in the 90s. 00:08:11 Kaleena�s older brother got married. Her siblings and she bought a two bedrooms apartment in Briarwood and moved. They lived in Briarwood for twelve years. Transportation was more convenient and her relatives were living nearby. 00:09:21* Kaleena and her family started going to Chinatown less, and went to Flushing more instead. Flushing was empty and not many Chinese was in the area in the 1980s, but the area started blooming in the 2000s as more Chinese are moving into the neighborhood and small Chinese-owned business started booming. It was more convenient to go to Flushing than Chinatown. 00:11:01 She moved to Rego Park in 2012. There is a Chinese supermarket in the neighborhood within five minute walking distance. 00:12:20* Kaleena�s childhood memories in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Because her aunt lived in Corona, she often went to the park with her siblings and cousins to play handball and to ride bikes. In the recent years, she noticed there are a lot of Hispanics in the park during the summer and they are usually playing football or using the grills for BBQ. It is also difficult to find parking in the park. 00:14:30 Kaleena often passed by the places she and her family used to live because her aunts are still living in the neighborhoods. 00:16:49 Kaleena and her family lived in Kowloon, Hong Kong before migrating to New York. Similar to the apartment they lived in Woodside, her family of seven including her older brother were living together in a studio when they were in Hong Kong. Her brother migrated to New York later because he was over the age of 18 and couldn�t come at the same time as the family. 00:17:39* Kaleena�s first impression of America. She thought there would be more non-Chinese living in America so it might be easier to learn English, but she realized there were Chinese in her high school and college and she's more used to communicating with Chinese. 00:18:44* Things her family brought with them when they were migrating. Her family tried to bring as much as they could to America. Because they knew they were starting a new life and don�t know what to expect in a new country, they brought a lot of clothes and other things with them to America. Even though there were things left behind, her older brother who was the last to migrate took care of the rest. 00:19:39 Parents found work in sweatshop from newspaper. Kaleena and her siblings also worked at the sweatshop with her parents during the summer. ",
  "Kamara_Kewulay_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Kewulay discusses how he came to America and how his experience in New York has taught him the value of diversity and language. Kewulay has lived in Jackson Heights since 1991, he discusses the changes that have occurred in his neighborhood and how it reflects on immigrants and other races. 00:00:40 Kewulay first came to United States in 1971 when he was 17 years old because his friend asked him if he wanted to finish one more year in high school in America. 00:01:35 His friend asked Kewulay to stay with a family named the Jackson family in Southwest Massachusetts. There were 5 boys in total, including himself. 00:02:40 Kewulay gotten accepted into many colleges but he decided to go to Oneonta, which is in upstate New York. 00:03:05 Kewulay was an active student in College, so he finished very early than other people. Then he got his first job in New York City. 00:04:37 Kewulay decided that he wanted to go to a new school so that he could do social research and learn more about political economy. 00:05:20 Kewulay lived an apartment in Corona and he stayed there until 1978 when he left and try to find a bigger place to live. 00:05:35 the reason why he wanted to move to bigger place was because of his pregnant wife. They moved somewhere in Jackson Heights one month before his son was born in 1991. 00:06:53 Kewulay never intended to become an immigrant when he came to the states. He came as a student. 00:10:32 Kewulay came to United States, not to just to make a big dream, he wanted the education and learn new things. 00:11:00 When Kewulay came to America, Africa gotten worse over the years. 00:11:30 Kewulay knew how to speak English when he came to America, so it wasn�t a problem. But he spoke in West African English accent, which made it difficult for people to understand. 00:12:39 Language is more about culture than about anything else. Even though you spoke other languages than English, there is still a language barrier. Kewulay gives an example of the �language and cultural barrier�. 00:18:20 Kewulay believes that in America, skin color gives too much history and little identity to your status in society, which cause racialization. 00:22:48 Kewulay believes that New York has the best transportation system that he knows since he has been traveling quite often. New York is an ideal place for living since you can just get around other places without a car and taxi. 00:24:55 Kewulay likes New York because he likes to learn and be educated about anything. He believes that in New York, people are able to learn about anything. 00:26:00 Kewulay also knows that New York has a lot of bad experiences and things that were very unpleasant for certain people, however, it is still history for him to remember. 00:28:00 Kewulay noticed that in his neighborhood, there were a lot more Mexicans than Columbian people now. There are other changes in various races too when it comes to population diversity. 00:32:20 Kewulay also noticed that in his neighborhood, there has been things that have been gentrified to the point where you never see those things again. 00:34:30 Kewulay believes that he is a scholar and that he was fine living with more Mexican people in his neighborhood. He knows that even though that they don�t know him as well, he knows their history and their life; they are like family to him. 00:39:50 Kewulay never seen any crimes in Jackson Heights ever, but he knows that there are crimes in his area and other neighborhood as well. He believes that crimes has always been there for a long time before, but he also believes that it still exist because security/police system has never changed. 00:41:10 Kewulay taught policing in John Jay College before for 22 years, but personally, he doesn�t like to deal with policing because it is racialized. The police treat other races differently depending on what skin color or race you are. 00:45:00 Kewulay believes that the prices are being overpriced for people who can�t afford it. He worries for the immigrants who come here because he is worried about where they are going to live. ",
  "Kamruzzaman_MD_timecode.txt": "Md. Kamruzzaman, originally from Bangladesh, lived for a while on the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific before coming to New York in November 2010. He works as a taxi driver. He talks about the challenge of getting to grips with the traffic system in New York and avoiding expensive tickets, e.g. for making a turn where you shouldn�t. He recounts the story of a passenger who asked to be taken to the moon. Context of the interview: �30th Ave � A Year in the Life of a Street� project (www.30thAve.org) Transcript notes for research I enjoy it because every day I met a different kind of people. It�s interesting to meet the different types of people. One time there was a really funny man. He asked me �can you take me to the moon?� And I was telling him �I don�t know how to get to the moon.� And he said �oh yeah I know how to get to the moon�. I dropped him in a normal street. I live in Queens. I�m from Bangladesh. New York I came last November. I make money, though only to survive, not to save money. The traffic is difficult. The morning time, rush hour, it�s very hard, and to follow all the signs. When you make a mistake you have to pay a ticket and when you have to pay the ticket it�s lots of money you need to pay. You have to be really careful. Especially parking tickets, sign tickets. I have got parking tickets and also when you make a turn when you shouldn�t. It�s a totally different system to the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Their system was the same system, but the traffic was nothing like this. So when I came here at first I really got a lot of tickets. I left Bangladesh about 20 years ago. I have family here, one son, who�s in school in Jamaica. These are all friends here [the other taxi drivers], we know each other. When we have problems we share them talking with each other. I was driving only daytime but sometimes I work a little bit later. ",
  "Kandel_Michael_timecode.txt": "Michael Kandel lives with his husband and adopted daughter in flushing. Michael shares his experience of being a school teacher, home-owner, and a father. He compares queer life in Jackson Heights, Ozone Park, Manhattan, and Douglaston. 00:00:30: Michael was born in Jackson Heights in 1959. 00:01:30: Michael, his older brother, and parents lived in a rent-controlled apartment complex in Garden Bay Manor from 1955-1977. 00:04:07: He attended William Cullen Bryant high school in Long Island City. The class of 74-76 recently reunited, with some former students traveling from the west coast to meet with their former English teacher. This reunion attests to the strong ties created in queens schooling systems. 00:05:01: There is racial unrest at William Cullen Bryant High School when his brother, who is older by three years, attends the school. Students would beat up his brother and take his lunch money. When Michael attended the racial bullying had stopped. 00:07:06 By the time he attended high school Michael found friends in his school and in surrounding schools that also identified as queer youth. The easiest and most popular places for them to hang out were someone's basement and in bars. Checking age and I.D was not as common during this time so it was easy for underaged teens to have access to bars. These bars were mostly in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Bars in queens were segregated by ethnicity rather than sexual identity. 00:10:01: Public displays of flirtation such as winks would occur between two people of the same sex in Jackson Heights. It was easy for individuals to be comfortable in their sexuality here. Ozone Park/ Howard Beach was not as open to this idea because individuals here strongly adhered to their gender roles 00:11:03: Michael recalls the Summer of ‘77, the ‘Son of Sam’, and the blackout. A serial killer named David Berkowitz mostly targeted women in queens which pushed them to start tucking their hair in or change their haircuts. Michael recollects this time in New York as dangerous and falling apart; fear filled the subway stations. 00:12:30: Elephas on Northern Boulevard was a heterosexual disco venue but homosexual youth would go here. David Berkowitz struck here and instilled fear across all genders and sexualities. 00:13:41: Michael meets his husband Darryl for the first time in 1985. 00:14:40: He came out to his parents as bisexual when he was 15. His husband Darryl never got the opportunity to come out to his parents at an early age because of the cultural difference and limitations. 00:15:45: Homophobic families used to come together during the St. Patrick's day parade and spew hatred towards homosexuals. 00:16:43: Michael goes into the career of education at the age of 40. He finds it important to present himself as an out teacher in order to serve as a guide for his students that may question their sexuality. 00:17:55: Michael and Darryl Practice resisting arrest in the March of ‘87 in DC. 00:19:25: Michael and David get married at several locations and occasions: City hall, when Domestic Partnership was passed, and Toronto. Being in a biracial relationship helped to inspire his activism. 00:21:12: Michael’s mom says, “I understand you’re gay but couldn't you keep it in the race?” which shocks Michael. In high school, he dated black women which were okay with his mother because it was a heterosexual dynamic. 00:22:16: Vito Russo played a leading role in critiquing gay life in film. Michael and Darryl attended his talks and rallies. Their friend was Vito Russo’s first cousin which allowed them to get to know him on a more personal basis. 00:23:18: Boys in the Band, a play that came out in the late 60’s, portrayed a storyline of gays who strayed away from the norm. 00:26:28: Michael and Darryl march in the first pride parade in Jackson Heights because of the incident of Julio Rivera. He remembers being invited to candlelight vigils at churches. 00:29:30: Daniel Dromm largely contributes to the first ever Queens Pride Parade. 00:30:25: Queens pride complemented Manhattan pride. Their relationship helped to increase the number of supporters and allies of the queer community 00:31:50: When Mario Cuomo ran for governor of New York sayings against the other electee were “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo!” 00:34:52: Michael and Darryl look into moving to Douglaston and their broker, upon realizing that they’re a gay couple, makes it hard for them to get a mortgage. 00:36:31: Michael decides to decorate the exterior of the house for Halloween and a blow-up skeleton is stolen from his front yard. The following August the skeleton returns hanging over their tree. A rock from their rock garden was also taken to smash the windshield of his car. 00:38:40: Michael and Darryl get the opportunity to be sponsored to join the Douglaston Country Club in 2011. There is no issue that they are a gay couple but after the sponsor realizes Michael is Jewish the offer was discontinued. 00:40:31: Before Michael and Darryl adopt their daughter from China, Michael has to sign a document that confirms his heterosexuality. Throughout the process, Michael has to find various ways to hide the fact that he is married to a man. They later tried to adopt from Vietnam and Ethiopia but there were complications there as well. 00:43:50: Families were clearly uncomfortable with Darryl when meeting him for play dates. There were times that their daughter did not get invited to birthday parties. 00:44:35: The youth are much more comfortable in their sexuality today than in previous generations. A cross-dressing student in the school that Michael teaches was not discriminated against. Recently, there was a sex transitioning third-grader which was handled very well by the teaching administration and faculty. The parents, however, were complaining. During Michael’s time as a student in high school alternative feelings on sex and gender were kept on the down low and not as public as they are today. 00:47:40: Michael is concerned for the gay youth today who get taken advantage of by adults who display predatory behavior in public transit. This is where his personal activism continues in always encouraging his daughter and students to be aware of their surrounding. 00:50:38: In 1974 Drag was big in the bars in Jackson Heights. 00:53:10: In his youth, Michael and his friends would take part in drugs during their free time which may have gone hand in hand with their questioning sexual identities. During this time quaaludes, poppers, and pot were popular. Public smoking of marijuana was not as big of an issue during this time. 00:55:44: Frye Boots, platform shoes, and orange polyester were popular fashion trends during the 1970s. New York’s style as a whole was grunge-like. 00:59:59: Handkerchiefs in the back left or right pockets would determine whether someone was a top or a bottom. 01:00:40: Michael recollects being a suit fitter at Bloomingdales and having older men flirt with him. 01:01:50: Michael wants to see a change in the quantity and quality of housing offered to homeless queer youth who are kicked out of their homes.

  "Katz_Terry_timecode.txt": "Terry Katz was born and raised in Pomonok Housing Project. His love and treasured memories of Pomonok inspired him to create a documentary named ‘Pomonok Dreams’. In order to create the documentary he interviewed 120 Pomonok residents about their childhood growing up during the 1950’s and 1960’s. 00:00:30 Terry graduated high school in 1972. Terry notes that the hippie movement and the rise of environmentalism inspired him to be a geologist. However, he dropped out because he wasn’t familiar with the science that was required to be a geologist. 00:01:24 He went to Queens College for Communication Arts. After that, he went to New York Institute of Technology. Since then he has gotten involved in film making. 00:02:50 Terry had his own company for more than seven years called, ‘Pie Edit’. The company mostly did commercial editing. However, he had to terminate the company due to low profit margin. 00:04:46 Terry went back to college at New York University to obtain a Masters in Media Theory. 00:05:35 Two weeks before graduating from NYU, Terry got an offer from Saint John’s University to teach an [video] editing class. 00:06:58 * Terry talks about his documentary that he produced with Alan Stark, called ‘Pomonok Dreams’. Terry’s childhood friend, Alan, contacted him through Facebook to show his interest in the Pomonok Housing Project. The duo spent five years interviewing 120 Pomonok residents which resulted in an hour long documentary. People have given ‘Pomonok Dreams’ very positive feedback. 00:11:20* Terry explains the pros of public housing back when he was growing up. He says, “It was built for the working class and it wasn’t built for welfare purposes, it was built to give people who honestly wanted to succeed in life.” When Terry’s father came back from World War II he had to live in the basement of Terry’s grandfather’s basement. However, Pomonok Housing gave Terry’s father the opportunity to get his own residence. He felt as if the government cared for him and his family. Race didn’t come into play with economics, which helped Pomonok assimilate better. No one felt out of place. 00:15:26 Terry recalls that it was much more different back when he was growing up. Neighbors were much closer and social. Children were always eager to go out and play with their neighborhood friends. However, with smartphones and technology he finds that this is no longer the case. 00:21:17 Pomonok Dream’s first screening was in Chicago at the National Museum of Public Housing. Nicholas Bloom was the one who contacted the director of the museum. 00:22:10 Terry notes that even people in Chicago could relate to ‘Pomonok Dreams’. It made Terry realize that public housing was a positive experience for most people across the United States. 00:23:20 He says the documentary was mostly about what influenced his and Alan’s lives. Some viewers complained that ‘Pomonok Dreams’ only showed the positives and not the negatives about the Pomonok Housing Project. However, Terry explains that documentaries are always made from an unconscious bias. Documentaries are almost like a memoir. “It’s the way we remembered it”. 00:26:17* Terry goes onto describe the importance of the word ‘assimilation’. At the present days, people are not familiar with the importance of the word. When Terry was growing up in Pomonok everyone was an American. No one was left out. “Everyone was part of the same tribe.” However, Terry notes that in the present time people are too focused on nationalism that they forget about assimilation. He feels as if it’s one of the biggest issues we face today in terms of the acceptance of diversity. 00:30:36 Terry explains how much the world has changed since his childhood. He says that people are going to survival mode because of the many negative events happening around the world He states that history is an important part of human civilization. 00:35:05 He greatly voices his opinions against white-Americans that say that they are being discriminated against. He read an article that said 55% of white-Americans felt that way. Terry disagrees and says that it has always been easier for white-Americans. When Terry was growing up there was a saying, “Young, white, and free.” 00:40:10 Terry talks about Robert Moses. Moses was very powerful public official who worked mainly to design the New York metropolitan area. Terry says Robert Moses is the reason that cars are the dominant means of transportation in New York City. New York tolls were owned by a private company that belonged to Robert. 00:44:40 ‘Pomonok Dreams’ made people realize that public housing is not what people make it ought to be, but rather something that can be beautiful. 00:47:30 Terry talks about John F. Kennedy’s assassination and the recent release of the documents related to his assassination in October 2017. He continues to talk about politics. 00:51:00 Terry notes that Americans are not as united as they used to be. Terry explains a problem with today’s society is that everyone is made out to be a winner. He talks negatively about participation trophies. 00:57:00 He says that both males and females have their unique strengths. However, he doesn’t continue on because he notes that people tear down arguments when they don’t agree with something. ",

  "Kearney_Patrick_timecode.txt": "Patrick Kearney is the President of the Mineola Irish-American Center. He was born and raised in Ireland. Throughout the interview, Patrick talks about the experiences of his grandparents and his parents. He also discusses his life at home and his school life in Ireland. 00:00:25 Patrick Kearney was born in Ireland. His father was born in 1916. You can look up the Irish census, in there Patrick found about his grandparents. His grandmother immigrated to America, worked for a family, moved to Argentina and got married. She had a baby who died and her husband died tragically as well so she moved back to Ireland and married Patrick’s grandfather. Their first son was born in 1909. 00:01:25 Growing up in Ireland you didn’t ask too many questions so he never knew the entire story. He pieced it together much later. When there was talk going on, you were sent out to play. 00:01:50 When Patrick’s father was born, there was a family with the same name that lived a couple hundred yards away. He was helpful to them so when they got too old to take care of themselves, he lived with them. He took their house when they passed away. It was a three-bedroom detached house. There was a garden where the vegetables were grown. A few acres across a field which belonged to that house also became his fathers. *Break at 00:02:37* 00:02:38 Some of the fields were bad so you couldn’t do much with them but there was room for crops and potatoes. Bigger farmers needed help in the spring and the fall, his father was a laborer who would go help and in return they would get one drill of potatoes. They had two cows which they would leave on their field for grass. Any money raised would be used to buy clothes and shoes. 00:03:49 They also raised a couple of pigs, which were sold off. You would buy groceries and if you had the money you pay for it. If you didn’t, they put it in the book and when you came in to sell the pigs, you brought the money in and paid them off. 00:04:40 Sex in Ireland was not discussed. Patrick’s mom got pregnant at 16. When Patrick was 51, he asked where Willy came from, to which she responded that’s your step-brother. His father knew that his mother had a baby before they were married. Patrick’s mother was lucky; her step-mother took in Willy and raised him as her own. Patrick kind of knew Willy wasn’t her brother but didn’t know she was his mother. 00:05:50 If a girl got pregnant before marriage in Ireland she was kicked out of the house before her father came home. If the father found out, he wouldn’t be responsible for what he would do to her. 00:06:13 Patrick was born in 1942 and was ten days old when his mother had to weed the drill of potatoes. Men tended the animals and went to work while the women did housework and tended the crops on field or garden. It didn’t get dark until 11 o’clock so the men worked their own field after dinner. 00:07:28 Patrick was 5 or 6 when he started going to school. You would go home, eat and then tend to whatever work needed to be done on the field. Playtime was limited to when there was nothing else to do. You made up games like hide and seek. There was very little toys. You got one present for Christmas and your birthday was just another day. *Break at 00:08:19* 00:08:20 The school had two rooms with a fireplace in each. If you were lucky, you brought lunch with you. Patrick’s was usually a bottle of milk or soda. For lunch you got two slices of bread, butter and sugar. A fellow classmate would get no lunch so Patrick would give him a piece of his. 00:09:40 To reach school you walked across the fields because if you took the road, it was twice or three times the length. The school was on Ballymun Road in Dublin. It started at 9 and ended at 3, consisting of reading, writing, and arithmetic. If you made a mistake, the stick came out and you got three slaps on each hand. There was no limit on how many times you can be punished in one day. 00:10:38 Patrick had a problem with his “L” and “S.” He would erase so much that there was a hole in the paper. As his punishment he had to walk to the second room that consisted of the 5th 6th and 7th graders who at the time were Patrick’s heroes that taught him to play football. He had to walk to each desk with his finger through the hole. At the age of 72, he still remembers that incident when he sees the word “Wall.” 00:11:55 Ms. Donavan was his favorite teacher. He was on 7 or 8 at the time but he knew a good looking woman when he saw one and that hasn’t changed. She had a very abusive husband and she got friendly with Patrick’s family. She wasn’t the nicest but she taught the kids well. 00:13:00 Patrick took the NYC Fireman’s test in 1968. His education in Ireland ended at age thirteen and a half. The people around him during the exam had high school jackets on and he was wondering what he was doing there. 13,000 people took that test and 1,168 passed the exam. Even with the little education he had, he was still one of them. 00:13:40 Patrick regrets not appreciating how good his education was and building on that foundation because he could’ve gone a long way. But even then he isn’t disappointed on where he ended up. 00:14:00 In Ireland you lived hand to mouth but they didn’t feel bad because some people were worse off. His mother would bake brown bread and Soda bread, which in Ireland was just white bread. There were no raisins in it that was corn cake which was made on Sundays or special days. Fruit cake was made for Christmas. The corn cake was actually called a “spotted dog” cake because when you cut it open, you saw four or five raisins. 00:15:30 Stew made of beef, potatoes and parsnips. Dinner time was one o’clock. It wasn’t a hard life but in comparison to here it was. ",

But it is not always so nice.” One freezing day in January, Diane Kennedy was keeping her friend, schoolcrossing guard HYPERLINK \"http://www.sunnysidesoundproject.org/?p=130\" \\o \"MARY ANN GUDONIS\" Mary Ann Gudonis company under the wooden pavilion at P.S. 150 on 43rd Avenue. I had come to interview Mary Ann, but Diane Kennedy was eager to speak to me as well. A blond and cheerful woman, Diane is a retired secretary. She used to work at Elmhurst Hospital and has lived on 41st Street in Sunnyside since 1986. Diane likes her neighbors but says the social dynamics have changed a great deal over the years. While in the past neighbors used to meet in each other’s apartments, have coffee, play cards and go shopping with each other, now they all keep to themselves.“A younger crowd has moved in from Manhattan,” she says, “and the rents have gone through the roof.” If her apartment weren’t rent-stabilized, she wouldn’t be able to afford to live in Sunnyside. Since her husband passed away three years ago, Diane lives with and takes care of her disabled sister. Diane is very engaged with the local community. She attends the 108th precinct and community board meetings and sometimes volunteers at the senior center, where she helps older people fill out applications for public assistance or offers her cell phone to those who can’t afford their own phone. Three days a week, she works as “a companion” for a sick woman in Manhattan. Diane wishes there were more public parks in Sunnyside, because she finds it easier to meet new people in the park than in bars. She also wishes there were a large bookstore in Sunnyside. Sometimes Diane goes with her friends to Sidetracks, one of the few local bars where the patrons are of all ages. “It’s expensive now. Years ago I didn’t have to pay for my own drinks—the men paid. Now it would cost me at least one hundred dollars!” She adds, laughing, “Ten drinks!” Diane tries to keep busy. She is chatty and laughs a lot, but a certain sadness in her voice never vanishes. She misses her husband. “The women are living a lot longer now than the men,” she says. “But it is not always so nice.” In this podcast Diane talks about how she met her husband when he came to buy a juicer at the store where she used to work.

The neighborhood attracted displaced people from different parts of Europe. Grandmother came to Ridgewood when Europe was partitioned after World War I. 00:05:21 Early 1950s brought immigrants with Germanic background but not necessarily German. They were from Slovenia and what was Yugoslavia. In the 1960s people from southern Italy came to Ridgewood because of bad economic conditions and Croatian immigration in the 1970s. Poles came to Ridgewood in the 1990s, Greenpoint could not accommodate and were still coming from Poland. 00:11:31 When Paul was growing up in the 1950s many people living in Ridgewood were of Germanic background.

  "Kim_ChunHee_timecode.txt": "Chun-He Kim is the youngest child born from a family of nine based in Daegu, South Korea. She has worked with in various positions at the Queens Library which she joined in 1987. She immigrated to Queens from South Korea with her husband and two daughters during the early 1980�s. In this interview Chun-Hee crafts a personal definition of what it means to live as immigrant with anecdotes about work, everyday life, and sorrow which take place throughout New York. Chun-Hee later discusses the differences in American and traditional Korea culture and how she has seen the library grow as a hub for recent Korean arrivals to New York City and other New York based immigrant populations. 00:00:43 Chun-hee talks about growing up in a large family with many siblings in Daegu, South Korea; she recalls having a pleasant childhood, graduating from college, and for four years taught English in a rural province in South Korea. She met her husband while she was teaching in school in 1978. 00:02:07 Her husband had aspirations of teaching music in the United States. Her oldest brother also invited them to stay and visit the United States. She and her husband applied for a petition to stay in the United States which took five years. In 1984 Chun-Hee visited New York for the first time, staying with her oldest brother who is a practicing physician in the United States. 00:03:13 Her husband joined her in New York City two months later. Her two young daughters lived temporarily with their grandparents in South Korea. 00:04:01 In the meantime, Chun-hee managed to afford an apartment in Queens and worked as a busy women�s boutique store in Midtown, Manhattan. She describes her employment as physical taxing with little time to rest. 00:05:00 Chun-hee�s husband found temporary work as a traveling piano tuner. Her husband worked many other arduous jobs, many of which afforded him one day of rest. Later her daughters came to stay in New York in 1985. She took this opportunity to attend government funded business school where she learned computer skills. 00:06:30 Chun-hee was introduced to the Queens Library during a class field trip. She was encouraged to take a clerical position at the library in 1987. Her husband worked other jobs, saved enough money, and opened up a candy store which he by himself in the Far Rockaways. 00:08:00 She recalls her husband�s long commute to the Far Rockaways and there always being problems at the corner store including vandalism, petty theft, and break-ins. 00:09:56 Her husband�s corner store was flagged and fined for not updating their license to have a pinball machine. Her husband did not renew the license because he had a similar name with the former store tenant. 00:10:16 She went in his stead to court in downtown Brooklyn and found out they owed a massive fine. A benevolent bureaucrat allowed her to pay much less of the fine that originally required. She�s remember this man�s generosity ever since. 00:13:48 Chun-hee heard from other Koreans that life in New York and America was dominated by hard physical work. She was mentally prepared to work hard. 00:15:24 Chun-hee recalls another impressive moment as an early immigrant to New York. She had accidentally placed her weekly salary in an envelope in the mailbox. She placed it in the mailbox at instead of mailing out a letter written for her daughter. She got her money back by waiting in the post-office until the mail truck man opened the boxes and collected mails and came back to post office 00:21:09 Her husband�s piano tuning job took him across the five boroughs and he would come home late. She moved within the Jackson Heights neighborhood. 00:21:56 She and her husband first rented a one bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights and later moved to a two bedroom apartment nearby. 00:22:58 She passed by the Jackson Heights Library every day on her way to work. She started to frequent the library because the family budget did not allow them to purchase books. She regrets not having found out the collection sooner. 00:24:38 She remembers an incident where her daughter called the Jackson Heights library �her friend�s library�. After hearing that Chun-hee was determined to also make it �her daughter�s library� too. 00:26:09 Chun-Hee�s husband planned on enrolling in music school in America. Unfortunately, this dream never materialized. 00:27:05 Chun-hee discusses how her daughters excelled in the American educational system because it was open and fostered creative and independent thinking. Her older daughter becomes heavily involved in performing arts. Her daughter was later chosen by a performing arts group led by NYC Ballet principal danseur Jacque D�Amboise in 1989. 00:3131 Chun-hee recalls attending her daughter�s show at Madison Square Garden where a very heterogeneous student body collaborated with professional singers, dancers, and choreographers. She remembers their performance was based on the 200th commemoration of the French Revolution. The students in Chun-hee�s daughter�s school performed a choreography dressed as French fries. 00:35:00 Chun-Hee was immensely moved by the depth and inclusive message of the performance. She recalls it as one of her defining New York City moments. Her daughter used this experience and later joined the Manhattan based youth theater group TADA starting from the 6th grade and until high school. People admonished Chun-hee for sending her daughter to Manhattan by herself but Chun-hee knew she was doing the right thing. 00:37:41 She states that New York City offers more than educational and financial opportunities to immigrants. People who live in New York City have access to great cultural institutions. 00:38:00 Her two daughters are now married with children and Chun Hee has four granddaughters. Last year the entire family went to Seoul together on a family trip. 00:39:22 She started working at the Queens Library when there was only one other Korean librarian working in the library system. This lady was the Mitchell Linden branch manager who immigrated to the United States in the 1950�s. She assigned Chun-hee the task of ordering new Korean language books for the Korea speaking population in Queens. 00:40:20 Chun-hee became involved in the Queens Library�s New American Programs and was invited to coordinate programming created for Korean library patrons. She became very close with the Queens Korea community communicating with families about their library needs. In the pre-internet era, Chun-hee visited the two largest Korea bookstores in Flushing and Manhattan and placed book orders. 00:42:00 Some of her other duties entailed weeding the collection, doing research, and doing outreach with Korean speaking patrons. [*Korean dialogue of what Korean library patrons would say to Chun-hee during their visits to the Queens Library.] 00:43:42 In 1990, Chun-Hee selected the name for the growing Queens Library Korean collection. She decided to call it �Han Nara�, which means in Korean �One Country�. The name is a direct mention to the desired unification of the two Koreas. She was inspired to call it this because of the recent unification between the Germanys. She became close with many Korea library patrons and learned their personal book tastes. She found this sort of work very rewarding. 00:46:51 She also participated in scouting performers in the local communities for Korean story telling events that were hosted by the library�s New American Program. She selected her most animated patrons and knew who had a knack for storytelling to participate in these story telling events. *Korean dialogues of what one memorable Korean library patron would tell her. 00:51:04 Chun-hee�s oldest daughter Yoo-ree also participated in these folk story telling events. These story telling events were a success and one time close to a hundred people showed up. Korean patrons and event attendees wanted to become involved in the production of these events and volunteered their time and effort. 00:52:21 In 1997, Chun-hee suffered from a herniated disc which was caused from physical activity working as an office aide in Jackson Heights. She stayed home for eight months and lost control of many of the Korean New American Programs events. 00:55:23 She feels that her duties in the Queens Library aiding Korean patrons were a mark of personal success in New York City. 00:56:25 Chun-hee used the library�s resources to educate herself on a variety of American history issues such as women�s suffrage, abolitionism, the Civil Right Movements, and the genocide of the American Indians. She would read books that patrons would return and get interested in these topics. 00:58:16 She was very impressed by the political message of the Broadway musical �Cabaret�. She took from it �that evil becomes from everyday people choosing not to speak up and do the right thing�. She feels that the level of civic education in American is very good compared to that of South Korea. She attributes this to the American tradition of strong libraries. 01:00:36 Chun-hee has strong emotions against celebrating Christopher Columbus Day because of the genocide of the American Indians. She also feels strongly in favor about the diversity in New York City and feels that strong library collections are useful for teaching the truth. 01:02:15 Chun-hee recalls a story about her first teaching job at girls high school in South Korea that was sponsored by a very wealthy benefactor. The school had a very nice and large library but the administrator did not want to spend funds on acquiring a library staff. 01:03:54 Chun-hee encouraged one of her students to speak with the school vice-principal about making the library more accessible. The vice-principal became infuriated with this student�s protests. 01:06:00 She recalls an Ivy League admission officer�s anecdote about selecting a student that spoke up to keep an unpopular position. Chun-hee wants to be brave like this student who spoke up against a majority. 01:09:49 When Chun-hee�s father passed away in 1993, she planned to take her daughters to South Korea for the funeral rites. Her daughter protested the long trip by claiming they had an important exam. She responded by saying that you will take many more tests in your life and that these once in a lifetime matters are more essential. Interview Part 2 November 8th 2016 [Interview in Korean] 00:00:54 Chun-hee gives some personal thoughts about immigrants and the process of their assimilation to American culture. She also gives thoughts on the obstacles that immigrants face in the United States. She tells an anecdote where an Asian boutique owner was yelled at by a Caucasian customer �Go Back to Your Country�. 00:02:01 This happened after a customer repeatedly purchased clothes and returned after wearing them one time. The boutique owner lashed back at the angry customer �You white Europeans killed all the Native Americans�. 00:03:31 This highly charged incident sparked Chun-hee�s desire to learn more about the Native Americans. She borrowed library books and did her own research. 00:04:13 When she encounters other Koreans in New York they ask her the question �Where do you live in New York? Are there many black people living there?� This casual racism prompted her to do her own research on African American history. 00:05:09 She talks about what she learned including her thought about the historical Middle Passage. She lauds the African American led Civil Right Movement for catalyzing change in American immigration law. 00:07:13 She talks about how her research about African American history. She disagrees that it was President Lincoln that freed the slaves. She talks about their emancipation being a synthesis of Abolitionists, Quakers, and the Underground Railroad. 00:08:50 She says that if she was alive in that era she would have assisted and hid runaway slaves. She goes onto discuss the courage of women abolitionists including Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. 00:10:10 She has found that the public library is a good source of contemporary literature that discusses social justice and fosters meaningful debate. 00:11:08 She recalls seeing recent immigrant much like herself wait in line for long hours to get free English lessons at the Flushing Library. She recalls being moved by their dedication. Seeing their efforts she led an ESL class of her own in the downstairs area of the Flushing Library. 00:12:34 Her class was staffed by recent immigrants from all over the world including recent arrivals from Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and China. She held her special class there every Wednesday and worked at the library on the weekends. She became close with her student as they bonded with each and together in the classroom. 00:14:19 She�d use contemporary issues such as the Soviet Union�s invasion of Afghanistan and apartheid in South Africa to reach her adult students and encourage them to be more vocal. 00:17:10 She recalls how the experience teaching experienced adults was different from teaching student in primary school. Her lessons were more life skill oriented and dealt with issues on how to navigate the American social structures. 00:19:09 She feels that her lessons helped her adult student learn how to small talk which she finds a basic in American culture. 00:20:22 Chun-hee talks about where and how Americans especially immigrants can learn civic culture and practice democracy. She remembers going to her daughter�s schools and seeing student talk freely and debate openly with their teachers and even principals. She found this relationship different from the very hierarchical student � teacher relationship in South Korea. 00:21:23 Chun-hee recalls a similar kind of openness being expressed during her daughter�s after school theater programs. She remembers seeing young student talk openly with elected officials. 00:22:27 Another anecdote involving democracy involved a younger colleague at the Jackson Heights Library. This colleague of Chun-hee was openly against an imbedded culture of accepting public smoking. She was the only vocal opponent supporting a ban on public smoking. Chun-hee says she was inspired by this to protect her personal rights and others rights as well. 00:25:31 She feels that American work culture has a place for those who speak up including voices of dissent. This has encouraged her to speak up and stand firm for what she believes is right. 00:26:40 She recalls a long standing legal dispute with the Library�s legal team involving a worker�s compensation related dispute. Instead of accepting a settlement, she remained firm until she won her fully owed worker�s compensation. She felt vindicated because of the union�s work in protecting her rights as an employee. 00:30:56 She felt that it would not be just to give up her rights to be fully compensated. Although she did not fight for these rights and labor laws, she feels that it would be amiss to give up so easily. ",
  "Kim_EunYoung_timecode.txt": "Ms. Eun-Young Kim moved to America from South Korea, settling in Flushing where she lived for four years. Soon after settling in Flushing, Ms. Kim had her first child but soon faced a divorce. Ms. Kim received significant help from the Korean American Family Service Center. Ms. Kim�s son was granted American citizenship through the help of various organizations. Eun-Young is currently attending school to become a social worker and she also is saving up to start her own business. Ms. Kim wants give back to the New York community because she feels that she has received so much assistance from city based organizations in the past. 00:00:40 Eun-young first came to New York in 2012 for a business trip. During her business trip she met her first husband whom she married soon after. She and her husband settled in together in Flushing. 00:01:48 When she first arrived in America, Eun-young felt that America was twenty years behind Korean public services. She notes that she had a difficult time navigating health care, supermarkets, public transportation, and many other things in her new country. However she did appreciate being able to find fresh air and fresh fruits in New York City. 00:03:31 Eun-young found it hard to make new friends because of her language barrier. She received a lot of assistance from the Korean American Family Center. Feeling desperate after having divorced her husband, Eun-young called 311 and was forwarded to the Korean American Family Service Center. Various city based organizations and non-profits also provided much assistance for Ms. Kim during her time of need. 00:08:36 Before she moved to America Eun-Young taught at a prestigious nail salon and beauty school in Korea. She had to find work the day after she was divorced. She managed to easily obtain her nail certificate in New York City and quickly found work after. Eun-young initially received subsidies from the government including day care assistance. She first started working part time doing nails and eventually became a full time worker. Ms. Kim found herself making a considerable amount of money (around four thousand a month). After Eun-young remarried she stopped working to take care of her son. Ms. Kim�s new husband is taekwondo instructor with twenty five years� experience teaching in New York City. Her husband operated a taekwondo school located in Bayside for ten years but had to relocate because of rising rents. Her husband relocated to another taekwondo school in New Hyde Park. 00:13:13 Eun-young is currently attending a New York City vocational school and taking English classes. She wants to run her own nail saloon business after her son has been raised. In order to start her business, Ms. Kim has to save a considerable amount of money. She notes that there is lack of affordable daycare places in Long Island. She occasionally finds her asking people for babysitting favors. Currently Ms. Kim does not work because the cost of providing daycare would be more than her salary. She has heard that one can find affordable day care programs in Flushing. She has also heard that one can receive MTA subsidies while one has a child. She is looking to enroll in this benefit program. 00:16:55 Because her current�s husband�s age, Ms. Kim does not know how much longer he will be able to work. Because of this, Ms. Kim is thinking about her long term plans. Ms. Kim knows that she has to focus on her child�s future. Ultimately her current goal is to establish a nail saloon slash beauty school. 00:18:30 After waking up at six in the morning, Ms. Kim drops her son off at school. Sometimes she goes to the driving range or she goes to a caf� in Flushing to read books she has borrowed from the East Flushing Queens Library branch. Currently she is using her leisure time to learn English. She is keeping a goal of reading one book a week. 00:22:25 On holidays or when the weather is nice, Ms. Kim likes to visit the city parks. She occasionally visits the Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, New York Hall of Science. On the weekends she will visit the Kissena Park playground with other mothers that she knows. On rainy and days with inclement weather, Ms. Kim will take her child to the indoor Burger King playground located in Bayside. 00:24:02 Ms. Kim uses Korean a majority of the time. She will use English when she is at school, at the doctor�s, or at a government office. Although her child is learning to speak English at school, her child mostly speaks Korean at the house. Ms. Kim is concerned that she will not be able to communicate with her son in the future, and so she is working hard to teach him Korean. Although Ms. Kim is working hard on her English skills she feels that there is a limit to which she can express emotions in her new language. She is proud that her child is becoming a fluent Korean speaker and she has plans to send him to Korean language school once he becomes older. She believes that her son must have pride and confidence in his Korean identity. She is rearing her son to be an American that can understand and empathize with fellow Koreans. 00:28:11 Although she was raised Catholic in Korea, Ms. Kim began to attend the Ha Eun Church in Bayside after moving to Queens. She believes in the importance of keeping relationships with other people and that the Korean church offers methods for her to meet a diverse community. Ms. Kim was drawn towards the church after her divorce. She feels that this is because the Korean church is so influential in New York�s Korean American community. Ms. Kim feels that church provided much comfort and strength even for an only child such as herself living in a foreign country. She also feels that when you pray sometimes you will be rewarded with an answer. She feels that the church is source of warmth and she finds it a sanctuary. 00:35:20 In Flushing, Ms. Kim resided in a third floor duplex located on Francis Lewis Boulevard. Her house on Sanford Avenue was an apartment. After her divorce Ms. Kim found it hard to stay in her apartment on Sanford Avenue without steady income and a shaky legal status. Her Sanford Avenue landlords were Italian and were very hesitant to let Ms. Kim continue renting the apartment. Ms. Kim pled with a realtor because she wanted to raise her child in the apartment which had great natural light. Her realtor reluctantly agreed and assisted Ms. Kim in getting the correct paperwork so she could move in. After this incident Ms. Kim began to think that luck was on her side. 00:37:58 Ms. Kim states that the city government does a great job supporting immigrant mothers with various benefits. She is grateful for the State Department of Health for assisting her with powdered milk and various food stuffs. 00:42:52 Although her current house�s location is not the best, she is staying there because it is close to her husband�s work location. They are currently making plans to purchase the property outright. Although she finds Flushing very convenient for public transportation and for being able to find Korean food, Ms. Kim feels that Flushing lacks a sense of community and can feel cold. She wants her children to grow up in an English speaking community. She feels that if she continues to live in Flushing she will become part of the ethnic enclave there. She does not want that to happen. 00:46:22 Ms. Kim feels that physical Flushing has not changed in the six years she has resided in Queens. She does note that Flushing frequently receives new layers of asphalt. Ms. Kim works with various counselors at her church to figure out which government assistant programs she is eligible for. Ms. Kim finds living in America bit more difficult than living in Korea but she finds the �analog� life here somewhat appealing. Eun-young manages to experience a range of emotions by reading books available at the library. 00:50:45 Ms. Kim wants to be a mother than can understand her American born son. She feels that she is assimilating and becoming familiar with the country that her son will grow up in. Although Eun-young has never has any thoughts of returning to South Korea, she feels that she has not experienced the sense of heterogeneity that America is known for. 00:52:39 Ms. Kim personally has never felt or been the victim of racial discrimination. She believes the problems of racial discrimination are an inherent part of society. She wants to understand the hearts and minds of those who might rebuke her. 00:55:05 Ms. Kim has attended the Asian Food Festival. She attended the Festival in order to help a friend who was a food vendor. Currently Ms. Kim is receiving training to be a hotline volunteer for the New York Family Counseling Center. She wants to give back and assist the people and organizations that she received so much assistance from. Ms. Kim is also taking education in how to be a social worker. She wants to assist people in finding helpful social work related information. 00:58:50 Ms. Kim notes that New York State Office of Children and Family Services provides exceptional services for families with children. Dual earning families can also receive assistance in raising their children. This makes New York City an attractive location for immigrant families to have children. She calls New York City to a heaven for new immigrants. 01:01:40 Ms. Kim believes that the area of Queens she currently resides will not change that drastically in ten years. Although old homes are torn down for newer buildings, she feels like in thirty years one will still be able to revisit memories of former Queens. She notes that she wants New York City to become a place where new immigrant families don�t have to worry about being displaced. She hopes that in ten years New York will become a place where immigrant families will be welcomed and can flourish 1:05:25 America is a country that rewards those with passion and dedication with good opportunities. One does not necessarily need money to become successful. With dedication and education, one can make something of themselves in this country. ",
  "King_Brian_timecode.txt": "My name is Brian King. I�ve been in the area about two and half months now. We�re just starting up Vape Generation. We�re trying to get people to quit in a nice healthier way, giving people very much options. We�re talking ingest or otherwise, with varying rates of nicotine from zero all the way up to eighteen milligrams for the heavy smokers. That way they don�t go through withdrawals if they are trying to kick. We got very many different vessels to use as vaporizers, a lot of different kinds. You buy a vapor liquid, it comes with a cartridge to hold it on top, and there�s the battery on the bottom, and the battery determines the amount of life you are going to get of course. And it has a little heating element inside that atomizes the liquid, and instead of turning it into a smoke it�s actually a vapor, although you are exhaling, it looks like smoke, but it�s not. It gives you the oral fixation for it. And it tastes good, and it smells good too. People�s boyfriends and girlfriends are happy when they are not smoking because they don�t have to kiss an ashtray anymore. I was just a user of vapors, I lived in California, and I had seen several friends had some, so� I knew a little bit about it, I didn�t realize how much more learning I had to do as we got into this business though. The places that I had gone to before only had a limited supply of vaping devices, so I didn�t know the full broad range until I moved over here to New York where vaping is a little bit more�it�s starting up quite a bit larger than it would in California - because of Prop 215; which made other things legal to smoke in California. It�s a good thing to do outside the bar. I mean, you don�t stink when you�re done with it, that�s the main thing, I think. There�s nothing worse than coming in and breathing on somebody with tobacco smoke, �Hiiii, how arrrrre you?!� , doesn�t work out too well. We have the products from many different manufacturers; we are still stocking the shop. We will be the best stocked shop with liquids and devices and with knowledge of our products as well. We order all of our liquids in the United States which means a lot because some of the overseas stuff is made with inferior quality liquids. Pesticide grades of nicotine, instead of pharmaceutical grades that you get here. We are ordering some liquids from Europe as well. It�s propylene glycol which is pharmaceutical and food grade, and glycerin � a vegetable glycerin � and that�s food or pharmaceutical grade as well. It�s mostly the young folks that know about it but a lot of the older folks that come in and are trying to quit smoking � they have a lot of questions. And being able to answer their questions for them and let them know what�s going on�they usually work out the door with something. We don�t have a high-pressure sale here, we are more about education and then if you want the product after I educate you that�s fine, and if you don�t, that�s alright too. Just started working here about 10 days ago, when we opened the shop. I was in San Francisco before. I really like Astoria. It�s friendly people�a little bit busier than I am used to, but it�s a lot friendlier a happier folks. When you get somebody to stop and talk to you they are actually willing to give you a bit more time than they would in San Francisco. If you�re lost looking for somewhere, people will actually get on your phone and ask other people. They will try and help you to get what it is you need to get. I personally would like to start a wall full of photos of people who have stopped smoking, and can come in and update it, with month marks on the photo or something like that, and have a whole wall full of people. I just vape now. I had an oral fixation, I had to do something with my mouth, I was chewing on pens and pencils, toothpicks, and eating lollipops, and then I found vaping. Well I knew about it already and then it was like �hey, that�s what I need to go do.� So I went to a shop and they were very low-pressure, they taught me a little bit, and I realized that would be the type of shop I would like to work in � where you can educate people and let them make the decision of whether they want to get something or not. Before I worked in construction, most of my life. I�m not willing to work in ice though! Write-up: A new arrival on 30th Avenue is �Vapor Generation� at 36-20B. I quit smoking about five years ago when I became pregnant with my first child: while I�ve noticed vaping stores popping up around the neighborhood and people standing outside bars with their vape pens, vaping has been a bit of a mystery to me. So I spoke with Vapor Generation�s Brian King to find out more. Brian moved to Astoria from California two and a half months ago. He started working with Vapor Generation when it opened in late February. �We�re trying to get people to quit in a nice healthier way, giving people many options,� he says. �We�re talking ingest or otherwise, with varying rates of nicotine from zero all the way up to eighteen milligrams for the heavy smokers. That way they don�t go through withdrawals if they are trying to kick.� The store has a long counter where customers can test the products and glass cabinets where they are on display: the battery-powered vaping devices, and the liquids which go inside them. Along one wall is a black and white image of a lamp-lit street in Paris. �There�s a heating element inside that atomizes the liquid,� says Brian. �Instead of turning it into a smoke it�s actually a vapor. You are exhaling, and it looks like smoke, but it�s not.� He adds: �It tastes good, and it smells good too. People�s boyfriends and girlfriends are happy when they are not smoking because they don�t have to kiss an ashtray anymore.� Brian, who formerly worked in construction, started using vapors in California. �I had to do something with my mouth,� he says. �I was chewing on pens and pencils, toothpicks, and eating lollipops, and then I found vaping.� Until he got into the business, however, he did not realize how many options were available. Vape Generation sources its liquids from the US and Europe � avoiding other overseas sources given risks of them containing harmful ingredients such as pesticides. The liquids they sell contain pharmaceutical- or food-grade propylene glycol and glycerin. Vaping is picking up quicker in New York than in California, Brian says, �because of Prop 215, which has made other things legal to smoke in California.� (Prop 215 is the legislation allowing medical marijuana). While many of Vape Generation�s customers are young, older long-time smokers are also venturing in. Brian sees it as his role to educate them. �A lot of the older folks that come in and are trying to quit smoking � they have a lot of questions. It�s good to be able to answer their questions for them and let them know what�s going on.� Brian says that Astoria �has friendly people�it�s a little bit busier than I am used to. But when you get somebody to stop and talk to you they are actually willing to give you a bit more time than they would in San Francisco. If you�re lost looking for somewhere, people will actually get on your phone and ask other people. They will try and help you get what you need.� My name is Brian King. I�ve been in the area about two and half months now. We�re just starting up Vape Generation. We�re trying to get people to quit in a nice healthier way, giving people very much options. We�re talking ingest or otherwise, with varying rates of nicotine from zero all the way up to eighteen milligrams for the heavy smokers. That way they don�t go through withdrawals if they are trying to kick. We got very many different vessels to use as vaporizers, a lot of different kinds. You buy a vapor liquid, it comes with a cartridge to hold it on top, and there�s the battery on the bottom, and the battery determines the amount of life you are going to get of course. And it has a little heating element inside that atomizes the liquid, and instead of turning it into a smoke it�s actually a vapor, although you are exhaling, it looks like smoke, but it�s not. It gives you the oral fixation for it. And it tastes good, and it smells good too. People�s boyfriends and girlfriends are happy when they are not smoking because they don�t have to kiss an ashtray anymore. I was just a user of vapors, I lived in California, and I had seen several friends had some, so� I knew a little bit about it, I didn�t realize how much more learning I had to do as we got into this business though. The places that I had gone to before only had a limited supply of vaping devices, so I didn�t know the full broad range until I moved over here to New York where vaping is a little bit more�it�s starting up quite a bit larger than it would in California -because of Prop 215, which made other things legal to smoke in California. It�s a good thing to do outside the bar. I mean, you don�t stink when you�re done with it, that�s the main thing, I think. There�s nothing worse than coming in and breathing on somebody with tobacco smoke, �Hiiii, how arrrrre you?!� Doesn�t work out too well. We have the products from many different manufacturers; we are still stocking the shop. We will be the best stocked shop with liquids and devices and with knowledge of our products as well. We order all of our liquids in the United States which means a lot because some of the overseas stuff is made with inferior quality liquids. Pesticide grades of nicotine, instead of pharmaceutical grades that you get here. We are ordering some liquids from Europe as well. It�s propylene glycol which is pharmaceutical and food grade, and glycerin � a vegetable glycerin � and that�s food or pharmaceutical grade as well. It�s mostly the young folks that know about it Just started working here about 10 days ago, when we opened the shop. I was in San Francisco before. I really like Astoria. It�s friendly people�a little bit busier than I am used to, but it�s a lot friendlier a happier folks. When you get somebody to stop and talk to you they are actually willing to give you a bit more time than they would in San Francisco. If you�re lost looking for somewhere, people will actually get on your phone and ask other people. They will try and help you to get what it is you need to get. I personally would like to start a wall full of photos of people who have stopped smoking, and can come in and update it, with month marks on the photo or something like that, and have a whole wall full of people. I just vape now. I had an oral fixation, I had to do something with my mouth, I was chewing on pens and pencils, toothpicks, and eating lollipops, and then I found vaping. Well I knew about it already and then it was like �hey, that�s what I need to go do.� So I went to a shop and they were very low-pressure, they taught me a little bit, and I realized that would be the type of shop I would like to work in � where you can educate people and let them make the decision of whether they want to get something or not. Before I worked in construction, most of my life. I�m not willing to work in ice though! ",
  "Kolack_Diane_timecode.txt": "“It’s liberating to open up your choices to eating what grew on the farm this week.” This week Diane Kolack’s “box” contained one and a half pounds of string beans. While string beans are not her favorite vegetable, they embody a Weltanschauung that is dear to her heart and stomach. “Definitely it could be a burden,” Diane said as we sat in her Celtic Park co-op enveloped by the smell of baked squash and fresh applesauce. “But it could also be exciting and fun. It’s liberating to open up your choices to eating what grew on the farm this week.” As the founder of Sunnyside Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), Diane knows where her string beans came from. Picked just a couple of days ago at the Golden Earthworm Organic Farm on Long Island, they were packed in individual boxes along with potatoes, squash and other vegetables in season and shuttled less than 80 miles West to Sunnyside Community Services. On Thursday between 5 and 8 PM, they were picked up by 150 “shareholders” ready (or not) for their bounty. The shareholders had signed up with the farm at the beginning of the season and paid $540 for 26 weeks of vegetables, or 26 boxes, each feeding a household of four. Diane thinks that knowing the genesis of her string beans makes it harder to dislike them. “It also makes your cooking better,” she said, pointing out the delicious string bean salad she made last night. A student of sustainable food studies at CUNY, Diane went on to criticize the American obsession with choice. “It’s like ‘I want to eat this condiment with this food at this time and if I don’t get it, I’m very unsatisfied.’ ” ",
  "Kolack_Kevin_timecode.txt": "“Never have a backup because anything is easier than acting.” Kevin Kolack started his voiceover career as a nine-year-old. His “Teddy Tapes” featured stuffed animals gossiping about soccer practice and about who liked whom in grade school. “I had no idea that I would be allowed to do this as a job,” Kevin said as we sat down to talk in his Celtic Park apartment. “I think it’s pretty hilarious that I get paid to make funny sounds.”Before Kevin got paid to make funny sounds, he was a taxi driver, a college professor, a firefighter, an Olympic-level marksman, a soccer coach, a puppeteer, a swimming instructor, a florist and a magician. He has a PhD in Chemistry, a scuba diving certificate, a helicopter license, and is as adept in white water rafting as he is in skydiving, fire-eating and archery. Kevin is currently fully committed to his acting and voiceover career, and his special skills have landed him roles as paramedics in the TV series Law and Order and White Collar. (Just recently he cast himself in the role of Professor K, the main character in a science TV show for children he created.) Kevin advices to “Never have a back-up, because anything is easier than acting.” Each week he does multiple voiceover auditions, which he records behind a soundproofing egg crate partition in his apartment. The self-marketing an acting career requires is very time-consuming, and rejections are not uncommon. Things are further complicated by “the never-ending supply of people trying [to be actors], getting to auditions late and getting the casting director pissed off,” he said. “Everyone wants to be a star, so why not try it. [But] you have a much better chance to become a working actor if you’ve had a life and have some experience that you can bring to your role.” I forgot to ask Kevin which of his skills he relied on the most in his role as a turtle in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figure commercial. I can only assume it was not fire-eating, but you never know when that might come in handy. Thankfully, I caught him on tape as he did the voice of a pile of puke. Oh, and I should mention: Kevin is the husband of Diane Kolack. ",
  "Kosloff_June_timecode.txt": "Local artist June Kosloff shares memories of growing up in Parkway Village, Queens during the 1960s and 70s. The daughter of first generation Queens’s immigrants shares thoughts on growing up in the progressive and diverse neighborhood. June’s parents had creative leanings which rubbed off on her growing up, where she attended art schools in the city and later attended SUNY Purchase. After working for years in the music industry, an unexpected turn of events put June onto a new path that ultimately helped her discover a passion for curating art and redefining her vision as an artist. She shares how she curated her uncle’s artwork at various museums and galleries in the country. June shares her optimism for the future of Queens and how the city has evolved over the years. 00:00:00 Test, test. 00:00:26 Can you just please state your name, birthday and a little intro to yourself. 00:00:26 Hi, my name is June Kosloff. I’m from Jamaica Queens. I was born on June 18th, 1965. And I grew up in Parkway Village in Jamaica Queens. 00:00:48 Can you go into a little bit into your early life growing up in Jamaica Parkway Village in the 60s with your family? 00:00:55 Sure. Where I grew up was actually a very diverse community for its time. It was created for the United Nations diplomats and their families. And I’ve read several articles recently about why. And it was partially because the United Nations diplomats couldn’t get apartments in Manhattan near the UN due to racism. Therefore, they created this community which was a village basically – a mile or so long – a few blocks wide. Garden apartments. Two story apartments. And my family, my parents, are both American born. Second, actually first-generation Eastern European Jews. All but one of my grandparents was born in another country. So my parents grew up in New York. My father grew up in Jamaica, about a mile from Parkway Village. And my mother grew up in the Bronx on the Grand Concourse. They had been living in Manhattan and they were looking... My sister is 8 years older than me and they were looking for a place to live that was kind of progressive. I guess they wanted to be around likeminded people. And Parkway Village really lent itself well to their needs as a couple with a growing family. So there were all these people from all over the world from diplomat families, as well as, New Yorkers that wanted to live in a different, welcoming environment. It was very social. They had kind of, less people had open houses and lots of different food. Some of my earliest friends as a little kid that remember were from places like Turkey and Cyprus and Lebanon and Syria and Japan. There were American families there as well. It was really a great time to be a kid as far as I’m concerned. We had an outdoor – because Queens is very urban in a lot of places. We had a village green which was a very social area right in the middle. It was kind of protected even though it was between the grand central parkway, Main Street, Parsons Boulevard, and Union Turnpike. Which if you go there today, it’s a whole different kind of a place. I really loved it. Then unfortunately, my mother died in 1978. So that kind of changed our living situation and so my father, when I was about 16, going into 11th grade, he decided to move the family which was my brother, myself and him to Great Neck. Just because things were changing. He thought the school system was better. And you know he wanted to have that for us. For me unfortunately, I was going to the High School for Art and Design in Manhattan, riding the subways, which was a completely different experience than it is today. If I had a kid, I’d never let them ride in the subways like I did. 00:04:47 So you saw things on the subway as a kid that you shouldn’t have seen? 00:04:50 Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It was really, the city was a whole other cup of tea in those days. Times Square was a red-light district. Long Island City was a kind of no man’s land here. This station here, 23rd street and Ely Avenue. When I was in high school, there was a subway slasher at the station here. So I grew up being afraid of 23rd Street, Ely Avenue which is now Court Square. Because that was the subway that I took to school every day when I went to High School of Art and Design. So, yeah. It’s funny because in Long Island City, around my artists, I feel like I’m one of the only New Yorkers that actually… there are a few of us here that have seen things, go through this huge evolution. So it’s really quite something. [7 seconds deleted between 00:06:48 and 00:05:55 to keep political remarks confidential - N.M.] 00:05:49 So if we go back to your parents, what did they do for a living? In relation to the community, did they have opinions on the area? Did they have thoughts on living during that time period? 00:06:04 So my father was a manager of NY State Department of Labor, unemployment offices all over the city. So basically, when people lost their jobs, they’d go to the unemployment offices and they’d wait in these huge lines. He managed those offices, was a civil servant, and has a master’s degree in counseling. Before that, he had aspired to be a playwright. He had studied English and he went to Columbia after the war. He had continued writing probably ‘til at least I was born. And then the family life took over, he had this really good job for the state and my mother was a dressmaker. My mother’s mother owned a dress shop in the Bronx called Anna’s dresses. So my mother knew how to make clothing. And kind of had a side business where she would make clothing for a lot of people in the neighborhood. So it was kind of more of a side hustle. But she made me a lot of clothes. I was a very big tomboy and I didn’t want to wear any of the dresses that she made because I was too busy running around playing Ringolevio or baseball or football. But now I go, wow that would have been really fun to learn how to make dresses with my mom. So they definitely enjoyed the neighborhood and being around this diverse community. Especially for having both of them live through World War II and watching what hate and the other. And hating the other really means. So they were very open minded. 00:08:04 Did they talk about the war? 00:08:08 No. Every family is different. And people, again in my family there was such a bad thing going on. They didn’t want to talk about anything unnecessarily bad. And my father is still alive and I’ve been interviewing him, videotaping him talking about his life. So I know a lot about his experiences during the war. Funny enough, my father’s mother was a business woman and she had a factory here in Long Island City, a shoe factory in the 1940s until ’43 or ‘44, which was called Supreme Manufacturing Shoe Company Incorporated. And the building is still here in Dutch Kills. I actually just went to see it the other day. That makes me feel good that I had a grandmother who was ahead of her time. And what a great thing, what a great name for a company. And my mother had a lot of friends in the neighborhood, in Parkway Village and was well liked by people in general. We belonged to the food co-op so we ate all-natural food all the time. And I hated every minute of it. But now, I go, wow… 00:09:29 They were way ahead of their time 00:09:33 So when you talk to your father know, does he reminisce about how things were and the progression of this area? 00:09:41 Yeah. I take him here occasionally. My father dropped me off last weekend. And we drove up Central Boulevard and around and then we went to the shoe factory location. And, he was like wow I don’t even recognize this, this is another place. He’s been coming to the studio and shows I do over the years so he’s seen it. But this year, in particular, it’s really turned a corner. And all the new buildings. It’s like Long Island City has become another place. 00:10:16 For the better or worse? 00:10:17 [23 seconds of this section from 00:10:34 to 00:10:57 were removed to keep political remarks confidential – N.M.] I have to say that I’m enjoying the neighborhood. I like being around all different kinds of people, whether they are tourists or live here. I like food. So I like restaurants and coffee shops. And we happen to have a lot of independent shops here in Long Island City which is really nice, which is a plus for independent business owners. It can be seen as something that is a good thing for them. And as an artist, then there will be more people coming to the open studios and seeing the shows. [36 seconds from 00:11:39 to 00:12:15 were removed to keep political remarks confidential – N.M.] It’s been amazing. There are a lot of things going on all at the same time. 00:11:05 Going back to your early life, growing up with your siblings in the area, what kind of activities did you do in the area? 00:11:15 Growing up in Parkway Village, it was super fun. I remember having different groups of kids and we would go play big games of baseball in the Village Green. We would play Johnny Rides a Pony. Nobodies every heard of that game. Kind of rough. 00:11:36 What is that? 00:11:38 So you’d separate into two teams, maybe we had six people in each team. The biggest person would hug the tree and everyone else would hug the waist of the person in front of them. Then the other team would jump on you until you fell down. So you were essentially the pony until you fell down like everyone jumped on you. I had a bagel club for a while when every day we ate a bagel for 5 or 10 cents each. They were great. We played Ringolevio throughout the neighborhood. I can’t really remember how that goes. But there are two teams and it’s almost like a hide and seek game. We played a lot of Dodgeball, I played basketball, I rode my skateboard. We had one phone in the house and you had to share it. I don’t know how anyone did anything. But we did. We had friends. I went to a progressive school called the Queens School in Forest Hills. That was a very diverse school with all kinds of people from all over the world. And there were classes together like first and second grade were together, third and fourth. And then by fourth grade I asked to go to the public schools because all my friends were going. And we walked to school every day. Which was a long walk. And if I had kids, because I don’t have kids, I would never let them do that at the age of 11. 00:13:16 How long was the walk? 00:13:18 It must have a least been a mile. I went from Parkway Village to Briarwood, along Main Street. I mean we always walked in double or triple amount of kids. But still. It was pretty far. And there were a lot of weird things going on. And like now, when something happens in a neighborhood and it’s right away on the news. There is a camera. But then, things were happening and people didn’t know. Unfortunately, there was a lot of crime that never reported. Not that Queens was unsafe, but it was different times all over. There was gang warfare. But my neighborhood was really nice. And it was middle class. Pretty much, if you played in the neighborhood your parents would feel my kids are safe. 00:14:22 When you were growing up did you know you wanted to be an artist? Or had creative leanings? 00:14:31 Yeah. When I was a kid I really enjoyed drawing. I’m a thinker. I was an introvert as a kid. Now I like to talk a lot more. I learned how to draw when I was 8 or 10. My uncle who taught me how to draw someone’s face with a formula;This is how to do it. Then I got into comic books. I was drawing Snoopy and the Peanuts gang. And emulating others. I knew this was something that I liked and was good at. Then when I was in Junior High School I played the trumpet. I really love the trumpet. My father was not happy about Hillcrest High School. Which was the local high school I would have went to. He was like, “You need to go to another school. Try for Stuyvesant or Bronx Science.” But I was like, I want to go to Art and Design or Music and Art. Because I knew I wanted to do some art. And my mother was very artistic and would paint weird things on the wall. She did a sun and zig zags and everything matched and it was very 70s yellow. I got a little portfolio together and I got into Art and Design. And I don’t think I even applied to the other schools. But school came pretty easy to me in those days. I don’t remember studying for anything. The High School of Art and Design which now moved, was on 57th and 2nd was a wild place in 1980. 00:16:22 What would go on that was wild? 00:16:25 I don’t know if I want to say on tape. 00:16:26 Ok. 00:16:27 Things happened that would never happen today in high schools around the country. It wasn’t violent. It was more things people were doing like substance abuse. It was very different and you could get away with a lot more on school premises. I was a pretty good kid. I did well. And then we moved to Great Neck. So I left my artistic high school unfortunately. And moving in the middle of high school is not what any high school kid wants to do. So I applied for a few New York State colleges, SUNY Purchase being one of them because I know they had Art. And so I was not a full BA of Fine Arts major. I did have the opportunity to take a lot of art classes as a social sciences slash visual arts major. So I did photography and other art classes. And also did sociology which was good for me to learn how to write a little bit. Not that I still know how to write. It was a liberal arts education. But being around the arts, SUNY Purchase was amazing. I was surrounded by conservatory musicians, and actors and dancers and filmmakers. 00:17:54 But because it was outside of the city proper, was a culture shock moving away from the area. 00:18:02 A little bit. But I had a car. And we just went into the city and go to danceteria. I did an internship at a small video production company in my junior or senior year. It was accessible. It was about an hour ride in a car and the same on the train. 00:18:38 Did you have any mentors at SUNY Purchase? That guided your career? 00:18:47 Kind of, sort of. I had a couple of professors that were really good teachers. I can’t say, I didn’t have a mentor. I wish I had one. I did a lot of photography so I had a couple teachers that taught me a lot about photography. And I was in the dark room, printing, black and white, 35 mm. And I was working at the radio station on campus. So I knew a lot of people through that. It was a different time for me personally. I can look back and go, “I should have done it different.” But I did some interesting things and I ran the radio station for a while. And that was fun and interesting experience. And then I just did the last few years doing school and work. But it was great being around all that art and music. I went to the theatre. And the filmmakers that came out of SUNY Purchase. Lots of great actors, dancers, visual arts, you name it. It was a great place to go to undergraduate. I’m very proud of it. 00:20:16 What year did you graduate? 00:20:17 1987. 00:20:18 By the time you graduated, did you have an idea of what you wanted to do career wise at that point. 00:20:26 I knew that I wanted to, well my goal when I graduated college was to become a page at NBC and then go into production and TV. And somehow wind up making music videos or something like that, TV stuff. I wasn’t exactly pin point but I knew I wanted to go in that door. Unfortunately, three weeks after I graduated they stopped the page program at NBC. I had to take a different route. I come from this middle class family, so I had to get a job. So I did wind up going to work for an advertising agency, which I hated. 00:21:17 Which agency? 00:21:19 It was called the Howard Marlboro Group. I was making promotional items like hats, t-shirts, and buttons for Clinique and Exxon. It was part of Saatchi & Saatchi. Which is a big agency still. I was there for a year or so. Then I got a job at a TV station called, Financial News Network for a couple of months. Which I think is now CNBC. I was in ad sales. I wasn’t crazy about this whole ad sales thing. I was an assistant to sales people. Looking back, in retrospect, it’s interesting sometimes because I look back and they didn’t want me to leave because I got a job at USA networks. Because I thought I was going to get into TV, I’m going to get into production because I love that. It was different. You couldn’t pick up your iPhone and make a movie. You had to have resources. And I didn’t know, I would have been happy doing a production assistant job for a few years and making a living that way. But I thought if I get to USA network, I’ll get in and do that. But I was still in sales. Financial News Network didn’t want me to leave. So I was like, no I’m going to go to this sexy place. So I went to USA network. It was the same thing, different company. So then I was like nah. And then I tried to get into production and it didn’t happen. [28 seconds of this section from 00:24:15 to 00:24:43 were removed for personal information privacy NM] At the end of December 1990, I went on this interview to Charisma Records. And I got a job there. But I’d been pounding the pavement. I’d gone to 92 K-Rock as an ad sales coordinator job. All kinds of jobs. I was going to Atlanta Records. I was interviewing everywhere. People were like, “you’ll never do it, you’ll never work at a record label.” So then I got this job at record label and went ha! I was wearing jeans to work. I was going to rock and roll shows. I had a million CDs given to me all the time. I was in a candy store. 00:23:41 So was your official title? What were you doing at the company? 00:23:43 So I did several things. Charisma records became Virgin Records because Richard Branson who owned Virgin Records the label sold it. He owned both companies. So we became one in 1991 when I started they merged. So I was able to go from sales assistant to like a marketing coordinator job. Then I was on my own. My territory was independent record stores East of the Mississipi so I was calling them on the phone, doing promotion, working the tours, talking to people every day. That was my job. Working with the distribution company who goes and sells the CDs. I moved up. I became marketing manager, then regional sales manager. And then the whole thing fell apart in 2002. About 1,300 people lost their jobs in a layoff by EMI. By then it was owned by EMI, Virgin. It was an amazing time. I can’t say I became a millionaire working there. But I had some perks. I got to work with great artists. Ben Harper was one of my favorites. I had a personal relationship with him by the time he put out his first CD, Welcome to the Cruel World to you know when I left. The Verve. Cracker. Sneaker Pimps. We worked big artists like Janet Jackson, David Bowie, and Smashing Pumpkins. You name it. We had John Lee Hooker. We a blues arm of the company. It was a learning experience about the music business. Now it’s a whole different thing. I learned about music in general. And I hear it. Or I don’t. It was a great time, I have a lot of friends from that time. 00:26:12 Based on what happened, with Napster, the internet. Do you have any thoughts about the thoughts on future of music distribution? 00:26:25 No. (Laughs) That is a good question. I don’t know what the business model is now. The way I see it, it’s about the artist and going on tour. Music is free now. You pay a service and I hope the artist is paid. I don’t keep up with it. While I was in the music business, that I did for myself, which I was compelled to do, was to go and make art. So in the 90s, like 1994, I started going to the Arts Student League, regularly. So I studied with a teacher there, I went every week, I was a monitor. And I got some skills and techniques. Then I took other classes over the years. By the time I lost my job in 2002, I thought I was going to get my MFA in Fine Art. But for various reasons, it didn’t happen that way. I took that as, it’s not supposed to happen. I feel as artists, we have a lot of resources at our fingertips. If you want to make, you can do things a lot of different ways. I feel grateful that I have this space here that’s affordable to me. And I’m part of a community that has resources and opportunities to show. 00:28:11 What year did you come to this studio? Or did you have other studios? 00:28:18 I had other studios before this. Another thing that happened between all of this, my mother’s brother died in April of 2001 about 6 months before I lost my job at Virgin Records. So he was the last relative of my mothers. So I took care of his stuff. I knew he was an artist, he showed me how to draw, gave me my first camera. He was a visionary artist. He had made these beautiful works of art and I started to find it. He was a hoarder. I’m sorry Dick. His name was Uncle Dick. Richard Lubinsky. He was really an amazing artist. I realized that this was an opportunity to do something with it. Because the work was stunning. Everyone I showed it to was like, “Wow!”. Local Project and the first space that they had, I met them in 2003 through someone I met at the Arts Student League. I had a show in 2004 with my uncle’s work. I curated for the first time, this collection of my uncle, Dick Lubinsky at Local Project, where I am a Board Member. This was a turning point for me in my life in general and in my career. I don’t need to ask anyone any questions, I just do it. After I had that show, I had one more music job at at RCA and that ended. And I realized that this was not a viable option for me anymore. In the meantime, I wanted to show the Lubinsky more. I found this gallery called Fountain Gallery. Which is part of Fountain House in Manhattan which is a gallery for artist that live and work with their mental illness. And my uncle went to Fountain House in the late 60s. They allowed me to do a show there. Long story. So 2004 Local Project was the first show of my uncles work, the second was in 2006 at Fountain House Gallery of my uncle’s work. And I showed it at a few museums. All while I was still making artwork of my own. My uncle’s work has been showed at the American Visionary Museum, then the Erie Art Museum. So in 2009 it was American Visionary, 2010 Erie Art Museum. So it was pretty fantastic. I looked at his work as like a CD or record, but just visual art. He’s my Rockstar. I’m going to show his work. The good thing is that the work speaks for itself. It has a life of its own, like any good art. Art that is successful let’s say. So then by 2009 when my uncle’s work was up at the American Visionary museum, I was making art more, going to the Arts Students League. I started working on a specific series of work and I realized that I’m going to do my own show. I’m going to apply to Local Project and see if I can do a solo show. And so they allowed me to do a solo show in June of 2010. That again was another turning point for me, here in Queens. It all comes back to Queens. I enjoy that very much. It was the first time I’d ever sold work. I sold 4 pieces at that show on opening night and I was tremendously excited. “Wow, this is amazing.” And it’s not like it was a lot of money but the idea that someone wants to buy something and have a piece of you, in a way. And since 2010 I joined Local Project as part of the board. I ran some programming. I ran this music series for a few years called Music Under the 7. And tried to up my game here. Keep my work going. Keep evolving as an artist. My work is very different from my uncle’s. 00:33:16 I was going to ask what your work is exactly, how you interpret it? 00:33:20 So my work has changed over the years. What I’m doing now is, doing a different series of animals. I’ve been taking pictures for years. I love digital photography, I mean film is beautiful, but wow it’s not good for our wallets as much as digital. And there is also a lot more freedom. So everywhere I go, I use my camera phone. But I have a nice digital Nikon and I’ve been taking lots of pictures. I went to a lot of farms this year, went to the Catskills Animal Sanctuary. I went to the beach. I take pictures of farm animals. This year it’s mostly roosters and chickens from the farms. But they are not just roosters or chickens, they are symbols of us as human beings. They are really great with a lot of personality. They are really smart. You know they are funny. And I enjoy making them. I’ve done a lot of paintings and drawings of roosters and chickens from these farms, because I took a lot of pictures. I also did a self-portrait this year. It was really about my childhood and surviving. I guess we all have, I call them mechanisms of survival, like when bad things happen to you in life, what is it that I do? It’s just a question. I asked myself this question. And so I did this piece of me on a skateboard. I have a photo of myself on my skateboard, I think it was the year after my mother died. And I was like wow, I’m out there on a skateboard, but I’m like living my life. That was what I did. I just went forward on my skateboard. And I think as an adult, that person is part of me, and you know, came full circle. As life happens, I think of that part of me. And then who I am today. And I made this self-portrait, that is just the beginning of it, but I have the other one, not in my studio, it’s bigger. That was really good for me to make. Fun is a relative term. But it was an important piece for me to make. So I’ve had a very productive year this year, making art. Then I did a wall mural of a laughing gull that I took a photo of in July on the beach. 00:36:58 Which beach? 00:36:49 I went to the Rockaways. I went to Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge and then I visited a friend on the beach. Some days you have a good day. Sometimes you have a bad day. I had a good day with my camera. The wave was right there, the gull was flying perfect in the middle of a wave. And it was just spot on. So I took that and I made a wall mural. A friend of mine said oh yeah, you can come do this, no problem. The owner was fine with it. It was using outdoor, exterior paint. Not spray paint. It was really fun for me. I really enjoyed it. I felt like I want to do more of this. It’s exhilarating to make a mural. It was very hard, but I like the challenge. So that’s what I’ve been up to this year. 00:38:03 How do you balance your work life with art life? [7 seconds in this section from 00:39:55 to 00:40:02 were deleted for job confidentiality. –N.M.] 00:38:09 It’s a balancing act. I guess what I try to do, is be aware that it’s a balancing act. And I make sure that I take care of myself really well in order to give the best that I can to my job. I’m appreciative to have this job. I’m an admin in media telecom. It’s one of the hottest sections of banking I would say. [16 seconds in this section were deleted between 00:40:24 and 00:40:40 for job confidentiality N.M.] Because everything is about media and telecom. If the satellites go down, we go down, right? I’m happy to be there. I feel like they appreciate someone who is different, who is an artist. [23 seconds of this section were deleted between 00:42:01 and 00:41:24 for job confidentiality NM] Anyways, I do self-care. I sleep enough. I go to the gym. I eat well. I’m not a big partier. That keeps me focused I think. Sometimes it’s easier than others. Some things fall through the cracks. But I enjoy the challenge. I feel like it’s really different for me, like I know I’m working hard. But I’m working hard for myself. [21 seconds in this section were deleted between 00:42:00 and 00:42:21 for job confidentiality - N.M.] I’m living this life and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I really enjoy what I do. 00:39:42 To close, do you have thoughts on Queens in general. Growing up in the area…We’ve talked about a shift in the culture. And things have changed. Is there anything else you want to add about Queens before we close? As an artist? As a professional? 00:40:10 I’ve always been proud that I’ve grown up in Queens. That I am New Yorker that has seen all these different changes. That I’ve experienced it. And today, I feel the same way. I think I appreciate it more. I appreciate the expansiveness, not only physically. Like going to the Rockaways, that’s Queens. Jamaica Bay Wildlife. It’s huge. Exploring in a different way. The different areas. Culturally, it’s so diverse. It’s become even more diverse than when I was a kid. Like where I grew up is a microcosm of what Queens has become. I’m really proud of being a Queens New Yorker. Also being a second generation American. That makes me feel good. And I also think Queens is being looked at from a lot of different angles, from a lot of people all over the world as this melting pot that is successful. I think that is really an interesting way to look at it. 00:41:35 Thank you very much. This is Sarah Hughes October 27th at 3:30pm. ",

  "Kremer_Matthew_timecode.txt": "After recording a reading of his poem, \"in memory of mary sendek,\" poet and Elmhurst resident, Matthew Kremer, answered a few questions about his inspiration to write about Queens and his experiences sharing his work with local residents. Kremer refers to Anthropologist Roger Sanjek's \"The Future of Us All: Race and Neighborhood Politics in New York City,\" and the work of historian, Vincent F. Seyfried as helpful resources for learning about the history of Elmhurst. 00:00:04 Matthew�s inspiration for this project came from recognizing that his residency in New York City would be short lived because he�s not fond of living around millions of people for his whole life. 00:00:25 He writes poems about his visions of Elmhurst to reconstruct what it looked like prior to his being there and speak against its gentrification. 00:01:14 He wanted to give something back to the neighborhood so he wouldn�t be another statistic contributing to the rise of corporatization. 00:02:18 Matthew read a study of the Corona and Elmhurst neighborhoods that gave him a desire to be more accurate in his poems. For instance, he was corrected by a reader when he wrote about the Elmhurst gas tanks imploding. 00:03:59 His poems have been published on a few blogs that speak to Queens related issues. Matthew notes that poetry is always circulated into the same hands, so he wanted them to be accessed by people who know the neighborhood that wouldn�t normally read poetry. 00:05:22 He feels a sense of awe at the idea that there was once an amusement park called Fairy Land at the site of Queens Center Mall.

  "Kriskiewicz_John_timecode.txt": "John Kriskiewicz spoke about what it was like attending the 1964-1965 world’s fairs as a child. He gave details about the fair and what sort of things it had to offer. Furthermore, Mr. Kris explains the history of the world’s fair and how it was a way for the ordinary people to view different countries and places at that time. He also talked about Robert Moses; the president of the fair, and his motive for constructing a small amount of buildings in the World Fair. Furthermore, he explained how the fair inspired him to become an architect and how it had opened his world; due to being enveloped by people with different backgrounds and cultures. 00:00:12 he was five years old when he first attended the world fair. He was really excited and thought it was unlike any other place he has seen before. 00:00:57 as a child, he was really impressed with the technology exhibit such as: the hall of science and the rocket park. He was also impressed with the automotive exhibits such as; Ford. Additionally, there were African dancers in the international pavilion. The fair had something for people of all ages. 00:02:50 the Unisphere was in the center of the fair. People were in awe when they first saw the exhibit. 00:03:54 critics were upset about how people would experience Michelangelo’s master piece because the people would have to stand on moving side walk to try to get a glimpse of it. The piece was enclosed in a bullet proof glass because they were afraid that something might happen to it. 00:05:00 the other states that were part of the fair were well represented. Since the average people in New York did not travel as much at that time; the fair was a way for them to visit other countries and state. For instance, West Virginia had glass wielding demonstration and Oregon had log rollers in the fair. 00:06:13 A lot of the international pavilion also offered food venues. 00:06:47 Queens, New York in the mid 60’s consisted of essentially white, middle class, and second generation immigrant. Thus, the journey to the world fair broadens his horizon and introduced him to many new immigrants. For example, his mother had to explain why some of the women in the subway were wearing saris since he had never seen such attires before. 00:09:04 He believes that Flushing Meadow Park was meant for the world fair ground. As a result, he considers that the park feels eerie when it is empty in our time. Primarily, because the excitement of the world fair is no longer there. However, there is still a sense of happiness at the park during the summer time when it is filled with people. 00:10:10 Flushing Meadows Corona Park was created for the 1939 world’s fair. It also served as the home of the United Nations while they were waiting for their headquarters to be completed in Manhattan. 00:11:29 The world of 1967 was completely different from the world of 1964. There was more crime and we were in the midst of the Vietnam War. Also, the park was declining in the 70’s and there was no money to maintain it. 00:12:54 Money began to be used to maintain and refurbish the park in the mid 80’s. Moreover, people started to appreciate the past more. For instance, the unisphere was declared as New York City land mark in 1980. The New York state pavilion also became an official New York City land mark a few years ago. 00:14:20 thinks that iconic things such as; the unisphere and the New York State Pavilion should stay the same physically, but they can be used for different purpose. For example, the New York state pavilion can be used as a place where concerts, exhibits, or festivals can be held. 00:16:00 Companies such as, Ford and General Motors were well represented at the fair because the fair was celebrating a consumer world. 00:18:49 He was a curious child, so his mother would take him to museum sometimes to satisfy his need for knowledge; he was really interested in buildings and cities. For that reason, attending the world fair was a natural transition. He found the fair to be visually stimulating and was inspired to become an architect. 00:20:36 The 1964-1965 world fair was called the lazy fair, because Moses allowed the people to do whatever they wanted. His idea was for the fair corporation to build the least amount of things because the fair was a devise to create the 20th century central park. Therefore, he was really happy when the U.S. Steele company wanted to sponsor the unisphere. 00:25:27 The fair might not have been important to the elites at that time. However, it was a happy memory for middle class children. 00:32:19 The fair provided an escape for people. The world was becoming complex and the news was usually not good. 00:34:40 There are still world fairs, but they have been replaced by televisions and the internet. It would be great if the world’s fair would show the latest technology and architectural designs. Moreover, address such as climate change in a way that is entertaining. ",

Leonore remembers Sunnyside�s farms housing horses and even camels. On 41st Street Sunnyside residents picked up fresh eggs and three blocks West on 44th Street�where Wendy�s is today�they cheered and boo�ed at the Golden Gloves boxing competitions. Asked what she considers special about Sunnyside, Leonore responds, �Everything. I could have moved many times, but I can�t find another Sunnyside.� In the interview, conducted by Paula Hostetter, Leonore talks about the romantic Saturday night dances at the park on 43rd Street and Greenpoint Avenue. After the war, men and women would dress up in gowns and tuxedos to listen an dance to the music of big bands. Children would dance in Hawaiian and Scotch costumes, competing with children from other parks. ",
  "Latchman_Jasoda_timecode.txt": "Jasoda has been a long-term resident of Queens and Brooklyn. In the interview, she discussed about the problems that the neighborhoods have been facing and she discussed about her opinions and solution to those problem. She also discussed about her experience about her neighborhood and what kind of people that she have deal with in Queens. 00:00:01 Jasoda’s home was built in 1935 and it was located in Brooklyn, NY. She moved to Queens after that and she stayed there till this day. 00:00:51 the neighbors in Brooklyn were mostly African American. Jasoda believes that raising kids in Brooklyn in that neighborhood wasn’t really that great. When she moved to Queens, the neighbor in her neighborhood was a little prejudice. One of her neighbors was very angry at Jasoda for buying the house, and disrespecting her for no reason. 00:01:52 Jasoda sees that in her neighborhood, things start to change a lot. When her original neighbor moved out and new neighbors came in, people in their neighborhood don’t get involved with anyone’s business. People live their own life in their neighborhood. 00:02:28 physically, the neighborhood starts change a little: the Department of Health plants trees for them, redoes the roads, create houses for people, and they try to make the neighborhood look nicer than before. 00:03:25 the transportations that was around the area was the MTA buses and trains. Jasoda, now, doesn’t take the public transportation anymore; she drives now and she is having an easier time to get to places now. 00:04:00 majority in her neighborhood, there are indo-Americans. There is a Catholic Church in her block. Jasoda is also Hindu. 00:04:37 Jasoda went to Prospect High School for her GED. She went Helen Fall School of Nursing, where she got her nursing degree. She sent her children at P.S. 63. Her eldest daughter went to Forest Hill High School and her youngest daughter went to John Bowne High School. 00:05:29 in her neighborhood, the neighbors are planting new trees in the block. Jasoda said that her neighborhood is called “The neighborhood of Mafia”. 00:06:28 Jasoda’s best personal memories is when she had this one neighbor that always offered her Christmas Gift every Christmas. That neighbor was very nice, respectful, and cheerful. He always kept saying hello to her at the window. However, that neighbor had a tragic car accident and Jasoda found out he passed away after she noticed a red Christmas hat on the floor and heard the news. 00:07:36 there aren’t that many parks in their neighborhood. The people used the parks for practice for almost every sport. 00:08:36 Jasoda wishes that one day, one Indo-American would become a Councilman, who will look after their needs and rights. 00:09:23 Jasoda wishes that the cars in the neighborhood to change because they have been drug dealings in the neighborhood lately. Drug dealing has been too dominated in her neighborhood. 00:10:32 Jasoda’s concern about zoning is the kids because sometimes when the kids go to school, they tend to go somewhere very far away and they could be late for school.

  "Lee_Norma_timecode.txt": "The longer of these two interviews is from May 22, 2013. We only have about five minutes of recording from the interview Luizzo did with Lee on May 7, 2013. Norma C. Lee was born in 1941 in the West Indies island of Jamaica. She lived in Manhattan on 105th Street as a child, moved down to 81st Street after marrying her husband Robert Lee and then moved to her current home in Laurelton in 1971. Whether in her workplace, her neighborhood or her children�s school, Norma always takes a leading role in improving her community and fostering good relationships amongst people. Working as a nurse in different hospitals, Norma was involved in organizing staff parties and events. She attends neighborhood block committees that are responsible for welcoming new neighbors and planning initiatives to beautify Laurelton. Today, Norma notes that Laurelton faces many challenges. The neighborhood is now mostly home to renters who are not planning to permanently settle in the area and are therefore not as invested in the improvement of the community. Parks and recreational areas have become dirt lots. Residents have to tolerate noise pollution from airplane and train thoroughfare without receiving any compensation or assistance from the MTA or other government agencies. Despite these challenges, Norma highly enjoys living in Laurelton and is not planning to move. She hopes that future Laurelton residents, including her children, take active roles in maintaining their homes and beautifying the neighborhood. 00:01:00: Lived in Manhattan on 105th Street as a child and went to school in that area. Moved to 81st Street after marrying her husband Robert Lee (a Chinese American); they had close access to Central Park and the area�s different museums. 00:02:03: However, the apartment elevator often malfunctioned. This became problematic after Norma had her first child. Her friend suggested that she buy a house in Queens. She settled in her current house in Laurelton because it felt like home with the comforts of a home. 00:03:40: Apartment in Manhattan became very chilly and uncomfortable during cold days. Landlord rationed heat very strictly. Norma enjoys being able to control the heat settings in her Laurelton home, and to have a basement and backyard for the children 00:04:25: Kids could play safely in open backyard and basement. Overall, there were a lot of people sharing the house. Husband�s daughter from previous marriage, Lai Ping (a registered nurse), and her (Lai Ping�s) daughter Carlotta also lived in house. Norma�s mother decided to move to Brooklyn to be with her sisters. 00:05:33: Moved to Queens in 1971. Norma�s house was built in a Spanish colonial stucco style. 00:07:32: Paid $32,000 for her house. Norma feels that a person�s salary should not be a deciding factor in purchasing a house. Salaries can change over the course of a person�s lifetime. Life circumstances change; people may decide to further their education in the future giving them a sufficient increase in finances. 00:09:12: Neighbors were mostly white when she first moved in. However, people (whites) started to move out. When blacks moved in, they found that the previous white residents did not maintain the houses very well. Blacks worked hard to remodel and beautify their houses. For example, they added new shingles and rooms. 00:10:38: Neighbors formed house beautification and neighborhood committees/block associations. Norma tried to be helpful and welcoming to new neighbors. 00:11:22: Whites who left were mostly Italian, Irish and Jewish. Norma purchased the house from a Jewish family surnamed Goldberg. Shortly after she settled, blacks started to move into the neighborhood. 00:13:18: Tried to settle new neighbors into the area. For example, she tried to welcome and help settle a new family from Jamaica. Eventually, that family decided to relocate to Brooklyn. 00:14:10: Majority of people now are Haitians. One-family houses have mostly become rentals. Three to four families now occupy one house. Most people who move to Laurelton do not plan to settle in the area. People now �come and go.� 00:15:17: Most renters are not invested in their neighborhood. They do not try to beautify the neighborhood. Littering has become a common problem. Also, people (renters) often do not inform the post-office of address changes. Mail addressed to previous residents often pile up and litter the neighborhood. 00:16:47: New coming young Haitians seem to be care more about the community. They sweep their front yards and keep the streets clean. 00:17:29: Daughter is currently a principal of a school and is also pursuing her doctorate at Hofstra University. Her son and grandson attended P.S. 156. 00:18:35: P.S 156 is now closing because of poor academic performance. Norma feels that parents should get more involved in their child�s education. They should, for example, attend PTA meetings and see what�s going on with their children. Lack of parental involvement in the school may be a principal reason why the school is closing. 00:19:57: Laurelton was a very integrated community. Whites and blacks lived together with no feuds and got along very well. People often got together for parties, barbeques and picnics. Children could ride their bicycles safely on the streets. 00:22:19: Laurelton Park has now become storage area for dirt piles and the place has been basically ruined. Breeze blows dirt throughout the park. The park�s decline began when drug addicts began to frequent the area during the 1970s. 00:23:32: Norma worked as a nurse at the Methadone center, where she took care of private pain patients. A rehab center called the Trump Pavilion, named after Donald Trump�s father, was opened. Norma began working there shortly after it opened. Trump Pavilion took in a lot of patients from nursing homes that closed down (usually because of mismanagement). 00:25:36: People working in Trump Pavilion were very active and involved in different committees and social events. There were many staff parties. For example, some of the staff joined disco dancing classes taught by a teacher that Norma recruited. Overall, people always got together for different events. 00:28:58: Norma initially did not have a car when she first moved to Laurelton. Her friends would drive her to a supermarket or she would walk to the supermarket and then take a cab home after purchasing groceries. 00:30:02: When Norma was first settling in Laurelton, she still kept her position as a nurse at Doctor�s Hospital in Manhattan. In her commute, she had to take the LIRR into Manhattan, then take an uptown train and then catch the crosstown bus. She always had to rush to make sure she timed her commute perfectly with the public transit timetable. 00:31:40: Many rich and famous people were treated at Doctor�s Hospital. 00:32:55: The hospital was very welcoming and considerate towards their patients. The facility was never short on staff. Catering was provided for patients and their families. Lounges and private bathrooms were provided for the nurses. 00:34:26: Norma mostly gets around by car now. She enjoys finding different places, getting around the neighborhood and overall being independently mobile. 00:34:55: When Norma moved to Laurelton during the 1970s, the bus ride, especially along Merrick Blvd, was very bumpy and uncomfortable. However, the road along the bus route has since been fixed and the ride is smoother. 00:35:50: Laurelton is home to a mixture of religious traditions. There are Catholics, Protestants, Episcopalians, Baptists, etc. However, church attendance has declined. 00:36:45: Norma planted corn on her lawn. She comments that the corn was the nicest and sweetest she has ever had. Other people also decided to plant corn after seeing Norma�s crops. 00:37:22: Today, Norma enjoys planting different vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers and pea plants. Her front lawn also has flowers, including irises that her son in law gave to her twenty years ago. 00:40:55: Norma hopes that her family continues to maintain the house. She feels that the house needs some fixing (e.g. new door, new roof). Maintaining and keeping the Laurelton house could provide important insurance for her family against unexpected difficulties such as inclement weather. For example, her daughter�s house in Valley Stream was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. 00:42:35: Twin Pond today is now a mess. There used to be good ice skating at the pond. Norma feels that the parks department should be more responsible for cleaning up natural recreation areas in Laurelton. 00:44:50: Airplane traffic has become an acute problem in Laurelton. Noise pollution from plane engines has become a severe problem. People living within a certain radius of the airport should receive compensation. The government should make their houses soundproof. 00:46:08: There is a plane going by every three minutes. Eventually, new residents get used to the noise. Norma has been trying to fight against any rerouting of planes that would negatively affect the Laurelton community. However, it seems that the people who make these decisions (on airplane routes) do not take the opinions of the Laurelton residents into consideration. Laurelton neighborhood committees are not recruited into the decision process. 00:47:23: Money was allocated to MTA as compensation for Laurelton residents. However, that compensation was never given to the residents. It is necessary for the residents to get this compensation to repair cracks in their houses as a result of the huge amount of train/airplane traffic. 00:48:18: Daughter�s first house was in Rosedale. Something in that house made her really sick and also compromised the health of the previous residents� son. There is some grave health hazard present in that area. Start of separate 00:05:21 recording from May 7, 2013 00:00:28: Norma would often hold parties at her house for her kids and their friends. They particularly enjoyed hanging out in the basement. The children would also play in the backyard and front yard. 00:02:19: Today, dirt from dirt piles in Laurelton Park flies all over the place and lands on top of people�s cars. 00:02:48: There used to be block parties. However, after a number of years strangers used to come and take the food, leading to severe arguments. Because of these incidents, the block parties were ended. 00:03:15: Norma has attended the Assembly of God church over the past twenty years. However, she hasn�t really gone to church this year. 00:04:00: Norma hopes that the roofs of the homes would be replaced with the original Spanish style tiles and that the cracks in the houses will be repaired.

  "Lee_Susie_timecode.txt": "Susie Lee was born in Flushing, Queens to Korean parents. She recalls her experiences growing up in the neighborhood in the 1990�s. Because she attended school from 7th-12th grade in Manhattan, she didn�t develop friendships in Flushing or many ties to the area. She compares the downtown area around Roosevelt and Main Street to Times Square and liked it better when Flushing was quieter. She describes the building where her parents and brother still live and some of the neighbors whom she�s known for years.

  "Lerman_Chumi_timecode.txt": "“The rabbi’s wife is the unofficial filling-in-the-blanks-of-whatever-is-needed.” A wooden dining table that seats ten people or more welcomes guests as they enter the home of Nechama, or Chumi, as Rabbi Lerman’s wife is commonly known. Chumi’s four-month-old daughter Shoshana gurgles and fidgets on the couch nearby. I begin the conversation by asking, “What are the traditional duties of the rabbi’s wife?” but quickly realize that my question may be premature (or even obsolete, considering the large table and newborn). Chumi became a “rebbetzin,” the official title, just last March, when her husband took on the available position at the Young Israel of Sunnyside Synagogue. The couple moved their three-year-old twins Chaim and Ahava and their six-year-old daughter Bracha from Jerusalem to Sunnyside just in time for Chumi to give birth to Shoshana. While having to settle and furnish their new house in Sunnyside Gardens, attend to a long chain of holiday and Torah celebrations, and find Jewish schools for the older children, Chumi made efforts to get to know the members of the orthodox community and familiarize herself with their needs. The couple is constantly broadening their email list and Chumi has joined the Yahoo Group SunnyMoms to find out more about how she can help the community grow. “The rabbi’s wife is the unofficial fill-in-the-blanks-of-whatever-is-needed,” she says, giggling at her understatement. While each couple and community decides on the rebbitzin’s role and duties, she is traditionally expected to host guests for meals over Shabbat. At those meals, the small size of Sunnyside’s orthodox Jewish community allows Chumi to pay special attention to people they “want to connect to more.” Chumi’s new role is familiar to her not only because giving and caring is one of the three pillars of Judaism. The daughter of a rabbi and an educator, Chumi earned her master’s degree in education from Long Island University before she moved to Israel 11 years ago. In Jerusalem she taught at a public school and acted as a “dorm-mother,” counseling American girls studying abroad. Chumi’s commitment to service only continues to grow. She and her husband have planned a series of events for this and next week’s Chanukah celebrations, including an open event on Friday night with songs, “Inspirational Torah” and hot kugel at their house on 47th Street. On Sunday, the community plays “Jewpardy,” shows an animated Chanukah children’s video and serves potato latkes, doughnuts and a dairy buffet at the synagogue on 43rd Avenue. In the podcast Chumi tells us about orthodox Jewish dating traditions and how she met her husband. ",
  "Lerman_Nesanal_timecode.txt": "“As Jews we have something unique to contribute to this diversity.” As I arrived at the Young Israel synagogue one recent rainy Tuesday morning, Rabbi Nesanal Lerman was bending over the brand-new Torah scroll, making sure that none of its assiduously hand-written letters were overlapping and thereby implying new meanings. The 37-year-old rabbi experienced a hectic start after being installed only three months ago in Sunnyside’s small orthodox Jewish community, which had been without a rabbi for several years. “It’s been a little bit erratic up until now,” Rabbi Lerman admits as we sat in the basement of the apartment building that houses The Young Israel synagogue. A month ago the community celebrated the dedication of a new Torah with a joyful procession down 47th Street, Skillman Avenue and up 46th Street. This was followed by Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Sukkoth, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. In addition to all the professional duties that come with holiday celebrations, the rabbi and his wife Nechama care for two young children and a little baby girl who was born only two months ago. But enthusiastic and ambitious by nature, Lerman appears to thrive on challenges. He now plans to renovate the synagogue, which he proudly notes is the only one offering daily services in all of Western Queens. He also wants to create a Jewish daycare center for those congregants who wish to expose their children to a Jewish learning environment. Raised in the orthodox community of Borrough Park, Brooklyn, Lerman lived in Jerusalem for the past eleven years, where he studied and helped establish a Jewish structure for its Anglo-Saxon population. He hopes that Sunnyside’s 20 observant orthodox Jewish member families will benefit from his intense and focused religious experience in Israel and that his presence will enrich the community as a whole. “We were looking for a place where there is a diversity of culture and where we can contribute,” Rabbi Lerman says about Sunnyside. “As Jews we have something unique to contribute to this diversity.” While he is still trying to read the map of his new territory—he considers finding out people’s needs and reaching out to fulfill them among his most important tasks—he relies on his two main philosophies, learning and believing. “The Torah says man’s created in the Godly image. There is so much that people can accomplish if they only believe. Every person has to look at himself as a deep text that they have to learn.” ",
  "Leventhal_Davi_timecode.txt": "So many musicians live in Astoria but they always have to leave Astoria to play their gigs. It�s the one borough that doesn�t have a music venue. There is the AMA � Astoria Music and Arts, a non-profit � they put on bands in Astoria Park. I�ve lived in Brooklyn before as well. You have those old families who have been there for a long time but they are more cultured. People who are from the neighborhood here, it seems that they have never left the neighborhood ever. I was living in Jersey. My girlfriend at the time was living in Paris; she came back here to finish up her Masters and was going to Columbia University. We started looking in Harlem and here. That was right when Astoria�s prices were going up and up, about four years ago. You don�t get that hectic-ness from the city. You feel like you�re in a village almost. Though there are a lot of places that blast techno music and that�s totally different from the culture here. One thing that�s missing a lot are little clothing boutiques, arts and crafts things, more artistic influences. And venues for musicians to go out and play; It�s hard to find live music here. I was born in Brazil moved here when I was one and a half years old. I grew up on Roosevelt Island till I was12 or 13 and then we moved to Jersey. My Dad worked for an insurance company in Brazil � he was relocated to open up a branch in New York. We originally came here just to be here for two years. That�s what my Dad�s contract was and that�s what they wanted � they didn�t want to live here permanently. All their extended family was back in Brazil etc. At the end of those 2 years they renewed their contract, then renewed again. When people hear I grew up on Roosevelt Island they say �who, what, why?� A few years after my family left they started building a lot of low income housing there so the atmosphere has changed a lot there. There used to be a lot of parks and it was tranquil. It�s its own little world that you would never imagine being next to Manhattan. A lot of my family�s friends were United Nations workers, translators and so forth, it was just so convenient. Because a lot of my friends were UN workers they now live all over the place. I drew caricatures of my teachers during high school � one time one of the teachers put my drawing of him up onto the overhead projector he usually used to show us the assignment for a week. He loved it. That teacher took it well but one of them called my parents in � he said I found these and put the paper on the table. My Dad started laughing and couldn�t stop. They guy just got more and more upset. So I always had a knack for drawing. I never thought of it in terms of making a career out of it until senior year of high school and that�s when I first had an art class. Then I started working on my portfolio immediately to get into schools, and got into Pratt Institute. That was very eye opening because everyone around me either came from art-oriented high school or grew up with art tutors, and there I was deciding in my senior year. I�ve been doing freelance gigs, right now I�m working at MOMA museum doing window museum change-overs. In terms of fine art I don�t have that steady work yet � I get commissions here and there or sell a work here or there or do a mural here or there. The owner [of Vesta Trattoria] approached me and said he wanted me to do something on that wall. He came up with the idea, for a farm scene, with a cow, pigs etc. And I just twisted it a little bit so that the cow and the pig are looking into the window that�s in the middle of the wall, as if to say �oh so that�s where our friends went.� Painting and outside mural has a lot more work involved because the surface has so much more texture. The one here in my back yard is 20 feet long; the one at Vesta is 25 feet long. The best part is the feedback from pedestrians. Thank god I�d already got my stage fright out of the way with this program I used to participate in at the Met. I used to copy master paintings in the galleries. I was concentrating on this painting, tweaking the face and everything, and I just heard �what�s wrong with his eyes?� I looked down and there was this 3 foot long little kid. And they are always dead on too. I looked at the painting and thought yeah the eyes are off. I always wanted to have feedback while a lot of the other artists would put headphones on. It�s fun to see people appreciating things that you�re doing. Mundo [restaurant, at 31-18 Broadway in Astoria] want me to do a mural � there�s an old beat-up mural there and they�d like me to do a mural there, whatever I want to paint. I paint with oil paint, pastels, watercolor, pencils, acrylic, as long as I can put it on paper. I like pen and ink � I think that�s my forte. That came to me naturally, before I had art class or anything like that. Most all of my drawings in pen are with the cheapest pen that you can buy the bic pen. I grew up with that, using it in school, and I love how it works. Oil I started painting with oil. Acrylic is a totally different process. My influences include Van Gogh, Velasquez, Peter Paul Rubens, and Jean Luis David. When I moved here was right before the bubble burst and then right after the bubble burst a lot of Brazilians started to go back to Brazil. I know a few other artists in Astoria but there isn�t that much unity among artists here. About a year ago I was wanting to start a collective, but I think I had a bigger vision than what the others intended � I wanted it to include professional artists from all boroughs to pool talent together. The others wanted to just include people in Astoria and I didn�t want that. I thought we could put on a big event or venue to include all arts, music, dancing, painters, sculptures �through it all together under one roof. Also in New York it�s kind of difficult because everybody is so busy and hardly has time for themselves - let alone for anything else. That�s what I found- people were very willing until the moment they had to do something. A lot of what I have developed as one of my styles is sort of surrealistic � it�s kind of my philosophy of life where everything is intertwined, so negative shapes are creating positive shapes of other things, so things morphing in and out of each other. I always try to keep things moving, fluid. And I try to keep the elements in mind � went through a phase when I particularly tried to represent that; so light, space as in depth, earth as in land mass, and water moving through it. I saw a documentary regarding the Afghanistan Buddha�s and I was thinking what�s the most noble artwork to engage with? For me that�s something monumental that reaches you in a spiritual way. I thought it would be amazing to chisel a Buddha into a 100ft cliff. That would be an ultimate masterpiece. Obviously I�m not doing to do that. So I try to make it more reasonable. I�ll take a piece of paper and think how can I make this piece of paper monumental. Also that�s why I started detailing it really fine. I want to create works that force people to pay attention, that have so much going on that the person so that they can travel within it. Also so that every time they look at it they see something else in it. It�s a lesson in focusing. Here in New York I feel that art should be completely accessible to everyone. ",
  "Lewis_Inez-Maria_timecode.txt": "Inez Lewis came to Queens with her parents, her brother and her sister. They lived at 119th road in Baisley Park, and then moved to 124 Avenue where her father built a house. She then got married 4 months after and moved to an apartment in South Ozone Park 134TH street for 3 years then to St. Albans until 1971. They moved to Rochdale in June 1971and lived there for 43 years. This complex consists of five thousand eight hundred and sixty (5860) apartments, some has terraces and comprised of one, two and three bedrooms. The population is twenty five thousand (25000) people which consists of predominantly black, such as Hispanic, West Indians, Haitians, and less than one percent white. The white Jews used to be the predominant race but they have moved out of the area, the synagogue on 137 Avenue is now a Unity Church while the synagogue on Baisley was turned into a Montessori school. In the early days there were only mountains and tunnels where children could play, but the city took the land and turned it into parks, tennis courts and basketball court.

  "Lindenbaum_Merrill_timecode.txt": "Merrill Lindenbaum was born and raised in Queens. In this interview, Merrill takes us on a tour all the way from her seventh birthday party at Flushing to her present day life in St. Albans. Merrill is a care-free, open, and a joyful person. Living life and enjoying what you want to enjoy is what Merrill thrives for. She simply didn�t care for things that don�t interest her. Even though Merrill wishes she could change a few things in her life if she had the chance to, she�s still content with her life. Merrill�s journey in Queens wasn�t exactly smooth, but she fought through it. 00:00:40 Merrill went to the [Long Island University] in Brooklyn. The university used to be the old Brooklyn Paramount Movie Theater. She describes he majors of her choice. 00:01:59 She was a history major, but she didn�t have any use for the college degree she achieved. 00:02:12 Merrill�s father was an attorney and her mother was his legal secretary. That�s how her parents met and later got married. 00:03:48 She lived in Queens for all her life. Merrill�s parents had an apartment at [Forest Hills] when she was born. As she grew older, the Lindenbaums bought a house in [Flushing]. 00:04:35 In 1950�s, Merrill recalls having her 7th birthday party at her new Flushing residence. 00:05:16 She recalls her parent buying the house in Flushing around 1958 for $30,000. 0005:26 Merrill describes the time of Vietnam War. She expresses her opinions of the Vietnam War. She painted herself as more of a spectator rather than an active participant at protests. However, she confidently notes that she was against the Vietnam War. 00:08:45 The Hippies Movement in 1960�s wasn�t really seen in Queens according to Merrill. 00:09:50 Merrill specifies why she was against the Vietnam War. 00:11:00 Merrill is currently retired but this is because she lost her job at the age of sixty-two. She describes the unfortunate events that followed through. 00:12:24* Merrill presently resides across the street of Hollis Gardens. She�s qualified to live there as a low income senior citizen. She outlines the positives and negatives of living in the Hollis Garden apartment complex. She specified that at one point she was almost homeless, but she doesn�t have to worry about that anymore. 00:16:15 Merrill illustrates her childhood and her parents. Generosity was a big part of Merrill�s family. 00:17:12 She recalls a humorous event her father was given a chance to invest in Birdseye frozen food patents. Merrill�s father said, �Who�s gonna eat this frozen food?� and threw away the multi-millionaire opportunity. 00:23:10 Merrill says that she doesn�t talk to her relatives anymore. She�s content with it. In addition, she also describes her childhood best friend, Theresa. 00:29:10 Merrill never had a love in her life. She expresses that, �It just didn�t happen.� She seems comfortable with the idea of not finding love. 00:31:20 Merrill describes her history of residency in Queens. She doesn�t quite recall the days past her residency at Hollis Hills. Back when she lived in Hollis Hills, the neighborhood was not yet officially designated. She would put �Queens Village� as her zip code for mail, in order to get her mail quicker. 00:33:00* Merrill indicates that she went to public schools for all her life. First she went to [P.S. 188], and then she went to [Junior High 109], which was called [Queens Village Junior High] at the time she attended. She also attended [Martin Van Buren High School]. She recalls the zoning-laws which forced students to go to a certain school that they didn�t want to. 00:38:15 Merrill doesn�t feel lonely because she keeps herself occupied. She actively looks for new things to do. She does what interests her, if it doesn�t interest her, she will not do it. 00:46:27 Merrill details the comfortable environment she grew up in. She also talks about her grandparents. 00:51:00 Merrill never had any interest in going to school, however she went because she had no other choice. 00:53:50* Queens is currently the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. However, when Merrill was growing up everyone around her neighborhood were White-Americans. Also, she stated that there were very few religions around her area. 00:58:00 Merrill boldly states that she�s not xenophobic. 1:00:00 Merrill defines her current neighborhood, [St. Albans]. When Merrill first moved to St. Albans, she wasn�t used to being around so many African Americans and African immigrants. The amount of diversity shocked her. 1:06:30 She worked for retail most of her life. Merrill goes into great details of her work life. She mentions how or why she got fired from her jobs. 1:16:00 She describes her feelings of having a car before and not having it anymore. She complaints about the transportation system and how it demotivated her to travel. 1:32:48 When Merrill was in college, she first wanted to be an accountant major and then she switched to education major. However, after knowing that she had no interest in those majors, she decided to major in history. She was very interested in history. 1:35:35 Merrill knew what she didn�t want to do, rather than knowing what to do exactly. She likes to do things at her own pace. 1:38:42* When Merrill looks at her past, she wishes she took more opportunities. In addition, she wishes she had studied harder and gotten better grades. But, she accepts the fact that she can�t go back and change things. Merrill is not sure if she�ll ever find herself, even though she�s happy and content. She never tried to find herself, but rather she went with the flow of life. She expresses about her parents� sicknesses and noted how they passed away. Merrill mentioned that before her parents passed away, they weren�t �living,� but rather �existing.� Merrill confidently states that she�s definitely �living,� even though her life is not perfect. 1:45:40 Merrill wanted to marry and have kids, but that never happened. Merrill isn�t exactly upset about it. 1:49:15 Merrill�s view on death and how she feels about it. ",

  "Loupakis_Peter_timecode.txt": "My name is Peter Loupakis and for the last thirty years now I have been teaching and instructing karate and gymnastics and acrobatics. My father [Tony] started teaching us when we were babies; I was one and a half years old. And my brother [Harry] was three at that time. And we continued ever since. I was born in Greece. We moved here when I was five and he was seven. By then we had already started doing tours as a group. We�re called the Trio Loupakis. We�ve been very successful, yes, all these trophies and first place awards. My father was first a champion wrestler in Greece. Then he turned that into acrobatics, and from that when we came to the states we opened up a karate school so that we could offer teaching in martial arts and acrobatic gymnastics. I would say it�s not so unusual any more [to have a Greek family in martial arts] but yet it�s an odd combination; and furthermore to have martial arts and the acrobatic gymnastics in one space. Normally they don�t work well together. But they should I think. They complement each other, you need similar skills. We teach all ages. I�d like to say its fun for anyone. Anyone can learn it just takes time, the ability is there. It�s a question of taking the course and time to learn to do it. Some people learn fast and you know they are naturals, some people take longer. But as long as you keep trying you will get it, that�s true. We are going in November to a regional competition and we came back from Las Vegas in July where we won two first places; one for a karate-based routine/demonstration and one for acrobatic gymnastics. It�s not a question of preference any more, whether I prefer performing or teaching. It�s just what I do. I perform, I compete, I teach, this is it. Martial arts fundamentally was for the practice of war. Over time and the generations we�ve turned it more into a philosophical�and now it�s more of an exercise program, kind of like Thai Bo but a little more into the strict rules of sparing and actual contact with your opponent, not just hitting the air. You get physical in the martial arts. That�s the difference from the aerobics, kickboxing, things like that. With the introduction of what is now the MMA [Mixed Martial Arts]. This is something that my father was doing a long time ago because he used to wrestle. So learning the karate, just one enhanced the other. We�ve fused them all. I like to say we take the best of each of them because over the course of the years, teachers come to our gym, and they were teachers that were teaching Kung Fu, Shotokan, Goju, different styles of martial arts. So we�ve gleaned a little bit of the pie from everyone. We set up here in 1973. Before it was a dance studio. We got very lucky. The space was as-is except we have expanded at the back to have more space. When we started we were 80% Greek attendees. Now that�s changed and we�re lucky if we�re 10% Greek. And then it�s just a whole mix of different�for example a Polish couple came in and brought their child. They go to a Polish school around the area so they then tell all their friends and suddenly we have an influx of Polish people because of that. And the same with other ethnicities, you know, and they each tell their friends. The classes are pretty mixed. We�re open to everyone of course. It�s funny how it shifts around. I�m not here all day. That�s one of the beauties of the job. We�re only after school hours. So that limits the amount of time. Teaching is a hard�you know, especially teaching children�it can be a little bit, how you say�taxing is the word. But it�s fun, and it�s never the same day at the office, ever. Never the same day. That�s one plus, keeping it exciting and keeping it fun. Outside the gym, I work as a physical education teacher as well, in the day time. And two students who have been with us for over 13 years they started when they were five years old they still come now. And their children come. I like to call them grandkids. I have like 8 or 9 grandkids now that come back. Students that bring their own children. I have two daughters. They are 17 and 15. And they are not as much into it now as before, it�s those hard teenage years. But when they were younger they were in it all the time. And in fact this Saturday they did a show with us near Madison Square Garden at the Pennsylvania Hotel which was a martial arts exhibition. We received a high honors award for one of the better demonstrations of the day. And it�s going to be in black belt magazine I believe next month. I don�t see [challenges with having a family business]�With my father I don�t know, we kind of adhered in a way that it�s, I mean I call him Tony I don�t call him Dad at work, you know, it�s different. For some people I don�t know if they could do it. I find it very pleasant. To walk in and say hello to my Dad and kiss him hello every time. Plus it helps our business because they see that its family owned and that we care and everyone�s involved, not just one person sitting behind a desk. One of the great things about my father is he�s 77 years old now, but he�s inside the gym every day, he�s teaching classes, he�s not just the one in the office signing people up. He�s actually active and in there, and he was in the demonstration with us on Saturday, he�s going to be in the demonstration with us next week, Saturday, when we have people in Athens Square. We go on at 2pm.",

  "M_Halim_timecode.txt": "My name is Halim. I am the owner of Harissa. I started it nine months ago. My previous job was as a waiter. Actually as a bus boy. Periyali, a Greek Restaurant. Then I worked with the same owner for 10 years as a waiter at Il Cantinori. 10th Street between Broadway and University Place [Manhattan]. When you work for the same time in a long place you think you want to do something else. Then I went into a partnership with someone in the city but that didn�t work so I decided to just give up the restaurant business. So I started driving a limo, from 2001 May all the way up to, well for seven years driving. I was driving almost the same people who I used to wait on. People who can afford to eat at places like Il Cantinori. I enjoyed the free time. I was like outside, I�d stop, there�s no stress because I have only a few customers and I knew the timing. So you pick them up and drop them, sometimes you spend the whole day with them. We always had something to talk about and I learned a lot from them. But at the same time every time I would drive them back to the restaurant to eat I would think �I can do this.� But in between I was about to open a place with a friend that I had but I lost almost everything. I was with an artist. And you know how artists are very eccentric. It takes three years to tell all this story. Then when you lose everything it�s a shock. But I said to myself I�m not going to lose all this. Then I spent a while driving cabs. And it was more interesting because you meet the real New York, like the inside. So you talk and you forget. I had spent almost 8 months working on it � it was in an apartment on Vernon Boulevard. Now everybody has opened next to that place. At the time I was going to open it there was no-one there. Everyone had the idea of renting an apartment and making it into a store. The guy with me was in antiques and there was an idea that you would be able to buy the furniture you�re sitting on. I blame him for everything else. He had an amazing idea but the worst to deal with. Before we started a business I was the guy who could talk on a phone, get the contracts etc. I lost money he lost a man, so�. Then this one came up so I said why not. I was always looking for a place where you could sit and enjoy the coffee, like a Mediterranean menu where you can have from vegetarian to meat etc. It�s inspired by Il Cantinori, because they were serving quality food. No matter what you do it�s all about being consistent in the food. I remember there was a guy there who said 15 years ago I had this pasta and it still tastes the same. Also the quality. You see the boxes with the fish, the tomatoes. That�s what makes it a success. Then I find that when you walk in a place it�s the whole atmosphere that counts. When we were building this place, renovating, we got some lunch � I bought a small can of Harissa. We were sitting on the floor, like in August last year. And we were thinking what shall we call the place. And I looked at the can and thought why not Harissa. In France now people they have it for breakfast. The North Africans they know it, the Europeans they know it�and the Americans, they are starting to know it. Driving, well I used to drive this couple, both actors � I learned a lot from them. Actually I was not so much their driver, more like a friend to them. And they�d invite me into the places they went. I liked that connection, it reminded me that it doesn�t matter who you are. Here is different. I enjoy it more. This is like you have a baby�you want to see your baby grow�and this is the same for me. Sometimes I spend 18 hours working. But still I go home and I sleep and then I�m up at 7.30. I used to open at 10. The kitchen closes at 11 but I�m here till like 12.30. It�s different, working for people, you want to go home. But for me this is home. About 4 percent of my customers are North African, the rest are just all the people who you see outside here. The owner at Il Cantinori he used to go to a table and just talk and talk and I was standing behind him saying I need to take the order�and now I see myself doing the same thing. When people go someplace to eat they want to take a break. And often they want to talk. Especially in New York�everything is individual things, they all do things by themselves. Now even at the supermarket you don�t have to talk to somebody you can cash up by yourself. You almost don�t talk to nobody. The good experience from back home that I�m seeing here at bit now is the flea market. You talk to people then when you�re buying something. It�s all about the experience too. You feel who wants to talk and who doesn�t. You have a sense oh this person is tired; this one is working on the computer. But I can tell when they want to take a break. You ask them if they want to have a glass of water etc� A customer came in yesterday and she said �in this place you have soul.� 30th Ave � it went down for a period and then went up again. I�ve seen 30th Avenue since 1989 � when I first came to NYC I was 24, in 1989. I knew one person who helped me, who lived in Corona. First time I went out I found a job as a bus boy. And it was a bit far to travel (I arrived here in October and it was very cold). So I moved a little bit closer. Myself and my friend we found a studio, here on 26th Street, then a one bed. I love it here. You don�t feel like an immigrant. Because everybody is. You don�t have anybody saying anything like �go back to your country�. It�s just home. When I came here 30th Avenue was very good, just like now, well, more with diners etc. After two years, in 1991, 92, 93 it started going a bit down. The crowd was different. Then Broadway started coming up, like how it is now. And then Grand caf� took over in their building which used to be a bank. Now you see a lot of the young, arty Manhattan people coming in. I have people who come here who say that it�s like East Village or Williamsburg, because it�s small and cozy. In the beginning it happened very quickly. I used to go 18 miles between the espresso machine and the coffee. It�s more a coffee shop, and the food is extra. My brother used to do that. We had a store. We had two windows and he�d switch the items from one window to another, to give people the idea of something changing, something new. It was a family store from my grandfather, to my father, to my brother. This is how I started, as a kid, you know by the register, picking up the coins and putting them back. It sells kitchenware. There was one time when my cousin and I we didn�t go with the family to our place in the country side for the summer. We stayed in Algiers. I had the keys for the store. So we decided to open the store when we were like 16 and 17, and work like normal. They had gone for a month. When they came back the store was almost empty because we didn�t know how to buy products. We knew how to sell. My father came back and he looked at the store and thought �what happened!� but he was also kind of happy. That�s also why I didn�t have a hard time working with people here in New York City. I had tougher experience. People who bargain with you, drive the prices down. That is how you learn. ",
  "Madathordy_Thara_timecode.txt": "Thara Madathordy is an Indian immigrant who moved to the US in 2003 after she got married. She talks about her education and upbringing in India, as well as the beauty of Jackson Heights, where she has lived since moving to New York. Thara also discusses the challenges she has faced in following the American education system when raising her daughters and the emotional difficulties she dealt with when she first moved here. Things changed when she was able to start working and she compares teaching in New York to teaching in India. 00:00:19: Thara talks about where she grew up in India and her education there. She discusses her family�s educated background. 00:02:06: She works as a part time teacher so she can take care of her kids. Thara discusses the differences in teaching older students in India and young kids in Jackson Heights. 00:05:10: Thara is passionate about teaching children because they are the new generation. She talks about the way elders trained her and other kids in India, in academics and morals. Because of her own upbringing, she tries to shape the values and morals of the kids she teaches, but notes that in America, everyone has different cultures and religions. 00:08:20: She talks about the challenges she had raising her first daughter due to the more hands-on learning in the US, and how that has helped her with her second daughter. 00:12:00: Thara thinks that the way her daughter is taught is sometimes unnecessarily complicated. She tries to teach her own techniques to her daughter to help her understand better. 00:13:30: Having a thorough understanding of English is important for the parents in order to teach their kids. 00:16:23: When she came to the U.S., she had a hard time. She considers herself to be a passive mom, but has noticed that mothers nowadays are much more active in their children�s education. For example, they take English classes. Thara had already learned English in India, but was unfamiliar with the U.S. education system. 00:19:07: She taught her daughters Sanskrit and Hindi, as well as her own language Malayalam. 00:20:00: Thara moved to Jackson Heights in August of 2003 and she even bought a house in Jackson Heights because she loves it so much. She describes the historic look of the neighborhood and its diversity. She especially likes Roosevelt Avenue because it is a public transportation hub and close to both airports. She thinks people should maintain the neighborhood better because it has become dirty. 00:24:00: She talks about the changes she has seen in the ethnicities that populate Jackson Heights and how people travel there to experience the shopping. She enjoys being surrounded by many South Asians because it feels like home and feels much safer to her. 00:28:35: She also sees many religions and their houses of worship. 00:29:47: Thara tries to maintain connections to the temple, but she believes that there is only one religion of humanity. She sticks with Hinduism so that her children will experience the culture and not become confused. At the temple, there are many classes and opportunities for volunteering, which is what she wants her daughter to take away from it. 00:32:50: She doesn�t really celebrate holidays because it goes too deep into religion. 00:33:50: Thara never really had any ideas of what America was like. She learned about the World Trade Center in school in India, and that�s how she learned about New York. She never thought she would get married and move to the U.S. because she was happy with her middle class lifestyle in India. 00:36:10: When she got to the US, it was a bit of a culture shock. She only knew her husband, so she stayed home all day while he was at work. It was emotionally difficult for her to go from working all day in India to not being allowed to work in New York due to her visa. It took her six months to get used to the time difference between India and New York. Getting her library card was the first exciting thing to happen to her, even though it took a while to figure out how to get there. 00:40:18: Thara gets emotional talking about not being able to go back home (to live) after marriage and being lonely in New York. When she started working, things changed for her because she liked being active. 00:43:30: She is active in the school leadership team and volunteers in the hospital when she can. This makes Thara proud of herself because she is a self-made woman and feels that people want to listen to what she has to say now. ",

  "Maguire_Thomas_timecode.txt": "Tommy is an Irish immigrant who came to New York in 1971 because he was appointed the godfather to his sister�s daughter. He recalls growing up on a farm in the countryside of Ireland in County Cavan with his family of six. He talks about his school days, his teachers, and his classes. He lived in London before coming New York. His first job was cleaning windows until he became a maintenance man in Manhattan. He wants his grandchildren to know that when he came to New York he had to work hard and be dedicated and he wants them to stay in contact with their Irish relatives across the pond. 00:00:13 Thomas came to the US at the age of twenty-five in October of 1971 to be godfather to one of his nieces. His brother-in-law had a job for him at a Power Plant Building on 45th street in Woodside. 00:00:53 Thomas had worked in London so when he came to New York, he missed it because of the great social life there. But once he got around to going to clubs, he met a lot of great people and decided to stay. 00:01:16 When he first arrived he lived with his sister in Sunnyside for a year and a half. Then he got an apartment in the Woodside/Sunnyside area with his brother who came back from Ireland. They lived together for a couple of years until he got married. 00:01:34 Before marriage, Thomas would go to the Red Mill Club in the Bronx. To get there, he would have to take the 7 Train to Grand Central and then the 4 Train Uptown to 104th street. He wasn�t used to taking public transportation so at every stop he would look out the window. Once he got to his stop, he began looking around when he spotted an African American man wearing blue transit clothing. Thomas didn�t ask him anything but the man pointed at a building with a green roof, he recognized that he was Irish and figured that was the place he was looking for. The Club eventually closed down since that area didn�t have a lot of Irish anymore. 00:03:25 Thomas was from a small country area called Land Galvin and County Cavan in Ireland. He was raised on a small farm, where his Dad took care of the farm and his mom took care of the family and cooked. They built a picnic area about fifteen years ago on the hillside. It�s an area where people gather to have a picnic. His grandfather, John Eddy Rodger Maguire, he was the last native speaker in West Cavan that�s why they dedicated this area to him. There�s a three mile hike where you can see the three counties, Fermanagh, Leitrim and Cavan. 00:04:55 Thomas has two brother and two sisters. His oldest sister came to the US when he was very young, he barely remembered her. He got to meet her once again when he moved to New York. She would come back to Ireland to visit with her seven kids. His other sister lives in Sunnyside Gardens with seven kids since the 1960s. His brother lived in Woodside and College Point, now he�s retired and living in the Catskills. His oldest brother lives back in Ireland, running the family farm. 00:06:20 Thomas thought about moving back to Ireland when he came here but when he was growing up there was no employment. So he went to England and later America to get work. 00:06:50 He went to an old fashioned, small school with less than thirty students. When he started in his first year of school, there were two teachers. As the number of students went down, there was only one teacher. There were two rooms in the school, the big room and the small room. He had the same teacher for eight years. He studied English, Irish, Math, and religious instructions. His teacher would always call him T�mas which was Gaelic for Thomas. 00:08:38 He studied up until 8th grade and at the age of fourteen went to St. Pat�s College in Cavan.

His Greek teacher became a Bishop later on. 00:09:58 After school ended, he stayed home to help his dad at the farm. At 18, he moved to England with his friends as a plumber and a factory worker. 00:10:30 He went back to Ireland before he moved to America because his sister had a child in New York. His brother-in-law had a job ready for him. 00:11:15 He got a job cleaning windows in Woodside for his sister�s mother-in-law and all her friends. 00:12:20 He thought New York was busy and he found the people he worked with liked Irish people.

  "Mallon_Michael_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Michael spoke how he grew up in Brooklyn and lived in Queens for a long time. He spoke about how his life was influenced by the people around him and how the LGBTQ community made a huge impact on his life. He also spoke about how society thinks about LGBTQ community and how he thinks everyone should be treated equally. He also spoke about political campaigns and issues that also relates to the LGBTQ community. 00:00:37 Michael was born in Brooklyn, NY in March 17, 1982 in Long Island College Hospital. The hospital currently no longer exists. It is next to famous restaurant, Junos, in downtown Brooklyn. 00:00:54 Michael was raised in Brooklyn near Greenwoods cemetery which is between Sunset Park and Park Slope. He lived with his parents and grandmother until late 2005. 00:01:14 Michael went to PS 172 for elementary school. The school was one of most diverse schools in Brooklyn and was a high performance school. He went to M.S. 51 in Park Slope. He went to telecommunication High School, which was a small school. Then he went to Brooklyn College. 00:01:52 Michael moved to Queens in October 2005. Michael and his partner at that time had a very serious relationship so they decided to move in together. 00:02:12 the reason why Michael decided to live in Queens was to find a neighborhood that accepted LGBTQ. His friend before kept recommending him Astoria. So Michael and his partner visited there, they ate lunch in the area, walked around, and they both really comfortable there. It was sort of a mix when it came to sexual identity, but they still felt safe in that area. Now, Michael and his partner live in Jackson Heights and they like how it is so diverse. 00:03:53 the apartment had only 1 bedroom, comforting, and affordable with their budget during 2005. The neighborhood was filled with more Brazilian, Egyptian, Western European culture that was moving into the neighborhood around the year of 2000s. There were more Columbian before, but not as much now. There aren’t as much Brazilian as well like the Columbian. The Egyptian is still going strong in the neighborhood. To summarize, there has been less diversity in the neighborhood cause of gentrification. 00:05:23 Michael lived in Astoria from 2005 till the late April of 2013. 00:06:06 when Michael moved in, most people from the LGBTQ wanted to protect from hate crime, and tolerance. People from the LGBTQ wanted to live in area where they aren’t discriminated against in society. In 2005, in terms of marriage for LGBTQ, it became a serious issue for people because everyone wanted to be in a safe environment which made people attack people from the LGBTQ. The community of LGBTQ was expanding more back then compared to the present time because of gentrification. 00:09:37 Michael broke up with his partner when he moved out Queens in 2013, however, he is still very good friends with him. When he moved out, he was sort of nomadic; he was staying with friends and family in Brooklyn. Eventually, Michael met with his love of his life, which is his fiancé right now. They moved into lower Manhattan, which is his fiancé place. He lived in the outside street from few years in Fulton Street. Around 4 weeks ago, Michael was in Fulton Park Slope and few days later, he and his fiancé got a place in 2nd Street. 00:11:08 when Michael moved into Queens, he wanted to move to place that accepted gay people, so he searched up gay people in Astoria, Queens and he saw a lot of people in the internet. He saw one of his closest friends, Derek McCaw, which is also an activist in Queens Politics. He had a group called, Outer Astoria, which is a social group for LGBTQ. Michael and his partner, at the time, met with some of the members in the group and they were introducing themselves in one of the group meetings. They went into one of the organizing meeting and that’s when Michael was starting to become an activist as well. Michael then continues to go to rallies, help out parades, and went to Queens’s prides. 00:17:57 the year after he became a volunteer, he became the secretary for the organization in 2008-2009. He helped out with the activities they had done still when he was like a volunteer the year before. Michael enjoyed meeting many activists in the borough from the marriage equality group and Queens’s pride. 00:21:52 Michael believed the parade is important for many reason. One reason would be visibility because it allows the LGBTQ community to be visible and known for other people in 37th Avenue, where it is the busiest commercial corridor in the area. Another reason would be to remind people to know that there are LGBTQ people everywhere and that they are not alone. Long time ago, when Michael didn’t join the LGBTQ community, there were a small handful of people in the community, but now, the community has grown a lot. 00:24:34 Michael came into the democratic club and became the leader of it cause of his connection with some of the council members and with support of the LGBTQ community. He went to some of the events that were in the club like canvases and fundraisers. When he showed some kind of commitment to the club, they invited him to join the board to become the fundraiser coach with Kenneth Newguy, who is currently in the board now still. 00:27:15 Michael also started to help out with the campaigns, endorsement, inviting the activists who were interested in the club. 00:27:53 Michael became the president of the club in 2012. Michael wanted to focus on diversity, because he wanted the club to reflect as Queens so that people would be comfortable on whom they really are. 00:29:35 the club was really highly respected and well-known in Queens at the time. However, outside of Queens, people didn’t know about the club as much since it wasn’t really well-known to the club. The club had really great members who were really committed to the club and they always came to the events and campaigns. 00:32:20 when Michael met with Councilman Dromm through a fundraiser and he got to know his work through Queens’s Pride. He knew what he stood for and Michael tries to help him out a lot with his campaigns. He helped him out when Councilman Dromm went against a councilwoman Helen Sears who was in office for many years. 00:36:34 when Councilman Dromm won, Michael applied to work for him. He was really grateful of him that he hired him. Michael helped him out planning his schedule for him in 2010. 00:37:10 Michael wanted to be a communication director since he was studying and working on how to do that. When the job was opened, he took the job and he was the communication director for about 3 years. He handles media advisory, writing press releases, holding press conferences, and providing answers when the media asks questions. 00:41:19 a huge issues that is happening in the city is immigration. The community has the largest immigration rate in the whole city and most of the people in the community are undocumented because it became more difficult to become a citizen than before. Another issue is Housing because of gentrification that is happening in the city.

  "Maringelli_Paul_timecode.txt": "I was introduced to Paul Maringelli one recent morning at the Aubergine Café on Skillman Avenue by his friend, John Millus, a.k.a The Mayor of Skillman Avenue. A graphic artist, Paul used to work as an art director for Penthouse magazine and as a cartoonist for Harvey Comics, but over the last years his career has slowed down. He now designs and lays out the pages of the Ridgewood Times. “I have a four-day weekend, instead of a two-day weekend,” the 59-year-old says about his part-time job. “When you have it you don’t want it, when you don’t have it, you want it.” In his spare time, Paul visits friends, hangs out with the usual suspects on the block, paints, plays the drums and listens to Jazz. When the jazz enthusiast heard that jazz legend Leon “Bix” Beiderbecke lived and died in Sunnyside, he began to research Beiderbecke’s last address. To Paul’s surprise it happened to be right across the street from his home. “Beiderbecke moved into Sunnyside and died,” Paul says, laughing. Despite Bix’s short Sunnyside stint, Paul encouraged community leaders to put up a commemoration plaque. In 2000, he started organizing the Bix Beiderbecke Jazz Concert. Last year the concert counted 14 jazz musicians, some of them quite renowned. It will have its tenth anniversary on August 7th 2010, and, for the second time, take place under the Sunnyside Arch. Dressed in a shiny black leather coat and a leopard scarf, Paul walked me to Bix’s plaque on 46th Street. On the way there he showed me the advertisement column on Skillman Avenue and 47th Street, which he painted after the events of 9/11. In the podcast Paul talks about his search for Bix’s last address and Sunnyside’s jazz-infused past. ",
  "Markouizos_Demetrios_timecode.txt": "I�ve been practicing in Astoria for close to 25 years. Since I was young � I always admired my pediatrician, both in Greece, and then in Brooklyn, who is still alive today. He was always telling me how he loved children and I do too. That gave me the boost to continue my studies and become a pediatrician. Children get easily sick but they get better fast. And you see them always energetic, moving around, and full of life. They make you young. That�s very inspirational. In the older population, sometimes when older people get sick and you see them deteriorate and that�s very heartbreaking. Kids know how to bounce back. They are very resilient and have a lot of resolve. That makes them very unique. To see them well, and grow, and develop, that is very rewarding. I had prostate cancer. It was the early stages. It was a little tough but I had a lot of good people around me � family, friends, and importantly my patients who gave me the inspiration to continue and fight, and I did it and overcame the disease. I�m cancer-free right now. That made me realize that life can take a turn for the worse at any time. So you have to enjoy your family, your friends, as well as the people that love you. And also appreciate your life and the passions that you have in life. My family comes first: I have a daughter who is 12 years old. So I say I have to enjoy every day. As one coach once said you have to make every day your masterpiece. That�s my inspiration. Sometimes I worry about every little thing. But you have to think positively and have a lot of reinforcement from the people around you, that�s very important. I started out on 30th Drive near the Greek Church [St Demetrios]. Then we moved to Crescent Street, and then I finally built this new building here on 37th Street, and I want to remain here for quite a few years. We built it for my practice and I wanted to provide multi-specialty within pediatrics like pulmonology, allergies, and gastroenterology. I also have a laboratory on the second floor which facilities it when any patients need blood-work, chemistries or other tests to be done in this office instead of going all over the place. When I started here 25 years ago it was very diverse � it�s getting even more diverse � but I also see a lot of people now from downtown Manhattan moving here because it�s become very expensive. 30th Avenue is becoming very, very chic and unique. So there�s a lot of effervescence and movement around here. So it�s a delight to be around here. It�s full of life. I speak fluent Greek, conversational Spanish and conversational French. Parents ask more questions than they used to. They go through the internet and sometimes they get the wrong information from there unfortunately. I see a lot of parents worry about vaccinations. I tell them to go to official websites like the Central Disease Committee and they have all the studies there explaining the side effects of each vaccine. I enjoy my family and patients. I love to travel and see different cultures and types of people � how they live and adapt to their environment. That�s what I would like to do more of in the future. Now I have some time because I have a good associate who helps me out. I love nature and I love earth so in the future that�s what I want to do more of. I�m a sensitive person � maybe that�s a bit of a minus � but I appreciate people and treat them with high respect. And the thing I most want from people is to say thank you and appreciate me � some people no matter what you do for them you can�t please them and I feel down that I did so much for this patient and then they don�t say thank you. I don�t demand that much. But unappreciative people I don�t appreciate! Appreciation and kindness and so on are very important to me. Money is secondary and a thank you is worth a million dollars to me. I feel like my patients are part of my extended family, and that�s how I treat them. I always try to accommodate them. And if I don�t know something I�ll send them to a specialist to help them out. And the most important thing is to have compliant people who will work with me � non-compliance issues make the treatment harder, the patient suffers. The infant or the child cannot tell us what the problem is so if we have poor communication between parent and physician the wellbeing of the child is going to suffer, so that�s why I tell the parents communicate with me and we�ll resolve most of the problems. When they get older like at four or five years old they can say my ear hurts, my body hurts and so on, you can communicate with them better. Unfortunately with an infant you can�t do that so most of the information comes from the parent. ",
  "Marong_Mandy_timecode.txt": "“In America, you need an English name.” Mandy is the owner of Sunnyside Nail Spa on 43rd Avenue, where I sometimes get my fingernails done. When I first moved to Sunnyside, I was thrilled to have finally found a manicurist sensitive and polite enough to not comment on my nervous nail picking habits. Mandy immigrated from China in 2000. She first took some English classes in Boston, but Boston, she says laughing, was far too boring. Chinese newspapers, restaurants and friends were hard to find. When she was told that New York was far more exciting, Mandy didn’t hesitate and moved. She worked at several nail salons in Manhattan before opening up her own spa five years ago. Her friend, who owns the dry cleaner next door, recommended Sunnyside to her as a good place for business. Mandy’s customers are from Rumania, Turkey, England and Latin America. They are like family to her. Many have been with her from the very beginning and talk to her about their children and their hobbies. She likes those customers the best who are polite and patient when she is busy, but understands that some people don’t have much time to wait. In the wee hours of the morning Mandy often gets up and goes online. Sometimes she tries to find cures for nail fungus and other problems she encounters on the job; at other times she researches new products. One of her latest discoveries is a nail polish that manicurists can use even on their own nails. It doesn’t chip or dissolve when it comes in touch with nail files or polish remover. A manicure with this special polish costs $10, as opposed to one with the regular polish, which costs $6. Mandy lives on Long Island but spends more time in Sunnyside than at home. She sometimes buys lunch at the Natural Tofu Restaurant on Queens Boulevard, where she knows what to order. She doesn’t like to go to other restaurants in Sunnyside because she can’t read the menu and is too embarrassed to ask for help. Although she is 52 years old and has a 26-year-old daughter, Mandy looks like she is in her late thirties. When I voice surprise about her age, she tells me that she has many wrinkles, often feels old and sleeps poorly at night. Why she has problems sleeping, she doesn’t know. She never worries about or plans for the future. She trusts strangers easily – her friends say too easily – and just lives life from one day to the next. In the audio piece Mandy tells us that a German friend who thought her original name – Mou Manrong – was too hard to pronounce, chose an American name for her. ",
  "Martin_Dianne_timecode.txt": "Peter: Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, my name is Peter Mari. I am here in Long Island City, Queens, NY on October 12th, Friday 2018. I am sitting here with Dianne Martin from Long Island City, Queens and we are about to conduct a Queens Memory Program Interview for my assignment. Peter: Dianne, tell me about growing up in Queens. Dianne: Well I didn’t grow up in Queens. I grew up in various places, I was born in Boston, went to something like, 13 different schools between Kindergarten and the 6th grade. But ended up spending my high school years in Hingham, Massachusetts. So, I’m from Massachusetts. Peter: When did you move from Massachusetts to your next location? Dianne: Well, my next location was actually when I went to college. I went to Rhode Island School of Design, so I spent three years in Providence going to school, ended up getting married at the end of my junior year which was probably a mistake, but and then, spent some time out of school but ended up going to Iowa for graduate school. I went to the University of Iowa for graduate school, so I was there for a year and a half, and then my husband and I moved to New York in 1965, I think it was, and so since then I’ve been a New Yorker. Peter: When you moved to New York, what was your first impression of it and did you think you would be living here? Dianne: Living here in Long Island City or…? Peter: Yes, for a long period of time or where could you see yourself. Dianne: I think, hmm, that’s an interesting question. I think when we first came to New York we certainly came here with the intention of staying, for sure. Both of us were interested in the arts. My husband was a writer, so we were both very much interested in being in New York. So, we were here for the long term. New York was very different in 1965 than it is now. We lived on the West Side in various places on the West Side. He was still in graduate school and I was, had two or three or a number of kinds of jobs and doing graphic design. For a while, I thought I might be able to make some money as a freelance graphic designer or freelance illustrator and I realize I just did not have the temperament for that and so I ended up in teaching. And, ended up getting a job at Spence School. It’s a private school and girls’ school in Manhattan. I ended up teaching there for 33 years, ended up being head of the department of a pretty large art department. So that was my day job as it were for 33 years. So, we, ended up moving around as people do on the west side of Manhattan. I ended up getting divorced in the 70s. As I mentioned to you before, I had moved to New Brunswick for one year which was a very unhappy year and so I really missed New York. I remember we had lived in a high-rise in a town outside of New Brunswick and it was the highest building around there and truly it was one of these things on a clear day you could see the World Trade Center and it kind of kept me going, you know it’s like ah, there’s New York, I could see it, but the commute killed me because I was working at Spence. So, that was awful, so I moved back to New York and at that point, I realized I could not afford to live in Manhattan because I was an artist and I couldn’t afford to have the space I needed to be an artist, to paint, and so, I ended up looking, asking around for friends and whatever and I heard about this community called Jackson Heights. I never, I don’t think aside from going to LaGuardia, I don’t think I’ve ever been to, I don’t, I don’t think I’d ever been to Queens, in fact, I’m pretty sure, I’ve never been to Queens so I got in the subway, on the number 7 and got off at 82nd street and got off and started looking for real estate offices and found one and they showed me an apartment which turned out to be a very nice apartment, you could just push her off there if you want, she’s fine. I didn’t want her to inhibit your.. Peter: No, it’s okay Dianne: At the benefit of who’s listening, this is my cat who’s crawling on the table here. Anyway, so anyway, it was a very nice apartment, it was a big two-bedroom apartment and so I had the largest bedroom was my studio and it was truly the largest studio I’d ever had. So, I ended up doing some really large work. Put big pieces of paper up on the wall and it was terrific. Then, I ended up meeting someone who’d become my partner for the next 30 years or so and our relationship continued, and I ended up in 1983, I think, moving to Long Island City and moving to where I live now although a smaller version of where I live now. Right now, I’m lucky to have a whole small house here on Long Island City, a place that has changed greatly since 1983. When I first moved here, it was not exactly scary, but it was very, very quiet. I lived one block north of Queens Plaza and at the time that I moved here in ’83, there was very little here, there were just some, a few small houses like the one I live in but then the rest of the buildings were small businesses or small warehouses or something like that. Now, Long Island City has become in the last, it seems like only a couple of years, has become an entire city with like 50 story buildings in it. So, I’ve seen that transition go on. Peter: How was Long Island City back in the 80s compared to now with the people, if you notice more crime or just an overall difference about the way it looked, physical appearance, the people and what was that like for you to transition from that to now? Dianne: Well, yeah, as I said it is really, really different, very, very, very different. As I said, I mean it was so quiet around here that walking from the subway, either subway then lucky to have many subways that are within 2 or 3 blocks in either direction. I would not take the subway home at night after eight o’clock was pushing it a little bit. Peter: Is there a reason why? Dianne: Well, it was very, very desolate, there were very few people on the street in fact almost no people on the street. And since there were no houses except for the two or three on my street, there were no lights really, not many lights, buildings or you know, there were no other buildings around, there were no doormen, you know, such as you see in Manhattan or things like that so it was very, very different. As far as crime, Long Island City was not exactly in my area but close to here were, on 31st Street in Long Island City was kind of a congregation point for prostitution and so if you drove around, you would certainly see that going on all the time, so it was a very, very different place. Well, you know the 70’s, the 80’s up until sometime in the 90’s, New York was kind of a different place than it is now. I mean, I think people who are young now take for granted that New York is a very safe place compared to what it was in the 70’s and 80’s that includes Manhattan of course so, yeah, very, very different and so, now I mean the transition which happened gradually but certainly in the last, let’s say in the last 5 years, the transition has been really cataclysmic and then the last two years, the transition just enormous. I mean, on the street now you see, people who are living in the new buildings around, you see. The biggest transition is that we see dogs. There were no dogs before, now we have people with dogs. I like dogs so that’s a good thing. You see people with babies in carriages, that was not the case before. You see a lot of people with pulling lots and lots of people pulling suitcases because there were a lot of hotels around here that happened, began to come in around maybe, five years ago or so. So, all of these hotels began going up. The first one went up, no one could believe it. It went up, just south of the plaza at a time when LIC was still pretty scuzzy looking. In the plaza and people thought, they must be out of their mind. I think I forget what the, it was a Comfort Inn I think, and I mean people that they were absolutely out of their mind like who do you think is going to stay there, it’s unsafe. I mean, but that’s no longer the case. Now, we have all kinds of hotels, you know, people, they, they, they are not necessarily inexpensive, some of them are but not, not all of them. I suppose they are a little less expensive than Manhattan which makes them the reason why people want to stay here and the access especially right around here, Queens Plaza because of the subways and the fact that we’re right at the foot of the 59th Street bridge, you can, you know two minutes can go across well given the traffic, you can go across the bridge to Manhattan so that transition has been really cataclysmic, yeah in the last 2 or three years particularly. Peter: Do you think working, you said as a teacher was the right thing for you? Dianne: It was the right thing for me. I think if I had persevered at it, I probably could have had a career as a freelance illustrator, but I don’t know that I would’ve really loved it. To be a freelancer, you have to have a particular kind of frame of mind and I’m, I don’t have that. You have to, it takes a while to build up a level of clientele so you’re not worrying about where your next job is going to come from and so teaching was, I certainly wasn’t rich, certainly teaching at a private school in New York even though Spence school is a very, very good school. At the time, most of the time, I was teaching there I would say that I was severely underpaid, so I was definitely not rich by any means and it was a lot of work. I was a department head, so I had a lot of administrative work, but that part was creative as well and I liked teaching. I’m lucky enough to have maintained contact with many of my former students and that’s one of the nice parts about teaching. So, it was the right thing for me. Peter: Do you believe that as a teacher you were impacting many lives every day? Dianne: I think I do actually, even though of course I taught art and you can say well somebody teaches English or Math has a greater impact. As I say, I’ve been very happy and really amazed at times, how many times people, wait a minute, it’s hard for me to call them women because I thought of them as girls. They may be girls even though they might be forty come back and say how much I ment to them which is a really, really nice thing, so I guess I did make an impact. Peter: That’s all great to hear. What ways of transportation did you mostly use within New York City? The subway? Dianne: The subway. Peter: The subway Dianne: And one of the great things moving to Jackson Heights was of course, I still, I took the number 7 to Queens Plaza and then I changed at Queens Plaza for the, at the time, I don’t know if it was at the end train at the time but anyway, whatever letter it was at the time, one stop at 59th and Lexon and got the uptown Lex to, to 86th street. So, one of the great things about it was my commute, was shortened so much by moving to Long Island City, because the whole number 7 trip was wiped out. I just got on here and had one stop from Lexington Avenue to 59th and then got the uptown number 6 after that so that was a great thing, really was. That’s one of the reasons why I moved to Long Island City in addition to the fact that I was, I had a relationship with my partner. Peter: Now as a child, did you enjoy living where you did and then when you grew up, were you home sick about the place that you had a connection with as a child? Dianne: Well, not so much as a child since I moved around so much as a child, but certainly during my, say from the 7th grade through before I went to college, I spent my time in Hingham, Massachusetts and that was my home and I, I do still now and then become homesick for Hingham. My ex-husband used to kid me about that: “all you want to do is move back to old Hingham, not really, I loved New York but Boston too, I loved Boston. Boston is a great place. Peter: I hear that Boston is a very, very nice place. Dianne: It is. Peter: For many, many things. Do you think that New York and Boston are very much alike, or do you think that New York or, is better than Boston or Boston is better than New York? Dianne: That’s interesting, I think New York is a, I don’t think they’re comparable at all, I mean, I think, I think New York is so much bigger than Boston. I love Boston and it’s a wonderful, wonderful place. The one thing that strikes me when I go there to museums or I don’t go often enough, I’d love Boston is, is where are all the people? I mean you should go around, and to walk around in Boston, the difference between walking around let’s say on... what would be comparable, I don’t know, around the commons let’s say or something like that and around on 5th Avenue here. The difference is enormous, there are just fewer people. There’s just less. Peter: In Boston? Dianne: Yeah, just like, you know, it’s not like Boston doesn’t have people, it does and I’m sure there are parts, I’m sure there are parts of Boston where there are more people especially in different times of the day, office buildings, whatever, but it’s just in general, it’s Boston as a, it’s a whole different kind of place. New York is so much bigger, so much more, there’s just more happening here. Wonderful as Boston is I have to say there is much more happening here than there is in Boston. Peter: Do you believe that New York is a wonderful place if you’re living in it and you didn’t move back to Boston? Dianne: Oh, I absolutely do think that! And in fact, even in the bad old days, and the bad old days were really pretty bad. In the 70’s, and a good part of the 80’s, in New York, things were not good. You know, I remember times taking the Uptown 6th going to work in the morning or not so much in the morning, at night, getting on the train at 86th Street at 5 o’clock in the afternoon and there would be cops running through the train chasing somebody who was robbing somebody. So, and even, in fact, even up towards the end of the 90’s, I spent some time working for the educational testing service. I was a reader for the advanced placement arts studio portfolios and part of the week, it was held in Trenton, NJ and so part of the week was that all of the readers would come up to New York for a, an outing for a day, you know, to go over exams and things and at the end of the day we were on the subway downtown to get, to go to Penn Station to get the train back to Trenton and the, the, the, people, all of the people, they didn’t know how to act on the subway. They just, they were sort of, I don’t, they weren’t sort of bopping around, but they were being too free and open, they were, they were getting looked at by what I thought were at the time, were some questionable types. Peter: So, you’ve seen a lot, so you’ve seen a lot. Dianne: And, I thought, and I said, I remembered saying to a couple of people, look here, you know, this is New York here, let’s just tone it down a little bit, trying, trying to be a little more circumspect and it just, just, you know, just and so yeah. New York is a, I do love New York. I really do. Even, even in those times, I loved New York. Peter: Within Long Island City, what, what do you believe drives people to, toward the city or do you believe there are some things that drive people away? Dianne: By the city, do you mean Manhattan? Peter: Long Island City. Dianne: Oh.. Peter: Within Queens. Dianne: Well, currently Long Island City is having this moment of hotness I guess you would say, it certainly is a hot place because of where it is. I mean, for years my partner and I lived here, lived here and said, you know, when are people going to figure out that this is like right across the east river, from Manhattan because when I would go to work, you know, people would say, you know, well, you know how long does it take for you to get in from there. I think they had no idea where Long Island City was. I think they thought I lived in Montauk or something like that. I think they had no conception of where Long Island City was. Peter: Wow, that’s totally the opposite. Dianne: Not any, not any. And, so now it’s completely different of course. Now people are drawn here by the fact that they figured out that Long Island City is right across the east river from Manhattan. So, at least, that’s how, that’s why I think they’re living here, yeah. Peter: What drives them away? Dianne: If anything is going to drive them away, it’s the fact that the development that’s happening here has happened all of a sudden and too fast with very few amenities. Up until 2 years ago, in this small neighborhood right around here, there was no place to buy groceries. Not one place, now there is a place that’s only a block away that’s a, that’s a kind of a, it’s not really a supermarket, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a large sort of deli that has a lot of basic stuff in it which is serviceable but it’s not a supermarket and we still don’t have in this area, around Queens Plaza, we still don’t have, I think there’s one supermarket but it’s for me, a fairly decent walk so there’s, there’s very little that we, for a long time, I said, that you know, for years, living here, I said that I would kill for, for a Starbucks and you know, in Manhattan there’s a Starbucks on every corner and I never go in one. Here, I would’ve killed for one. We still don’t have a Starbucks. Maybe there’s one further south in Long Island City but I don’t know about it yet. So, we don’t have for example, a Duane Reade. Now, in Manhattan, there’s a Duane Reade or a CVS on every other corner and it’s, they’re eating up Manhattan I think. But here, I swear, I would kill for a Duane Reade so we still don’t have those things. There’s so many big buildings going up all at once presumably at some point as we’ve been told for years by the Long Island City partnership, when there is a critical mass, that’s the way they put it: a critical mass, all these services will come, well, we’ll see. We do have a bookstore though. That’s one of the most incredible things is I think it was 2 winters ago, I saw on a community bulletin board thing online that we have a bookstore, I could not believe my eyes. It’s a couple of, it’s three or four blocks on the other side of the plaza and it’s not only a bookstore, it’s a real bookstore. It’s a branch of a bookstore that has, that has a couple of branches on the West side of Manhattan so if you know the west side of Manhattan, you know that it is a real bookstore, it’s a, and it’s a very nice one too so we’re lucky to have that. That’s a start, now if we could get a Whole Foods and a Duane Reade, I’d be happy, be good. Peter: Wow. What predictions do you have for the future of Queens? Astoria, Long Island City, anywhere around here. Dianne: Well, yeah, I mean the only part of Queens I know is Long Island City and my memories of Jackson Heights and a little bit of Astoria. And, and certainly Astoria is also changing, the part of Astoria along, along the river which it now, the real estate people apparently have a new name for that, they’re calling it “Westoria”. Which, you know when real estate people start giving names to neighborhoods that’s the beginning of the end as far as it, what it means is that big buildings are going to start going up there and they already have so. Peter: Wow. Now, about your parents, it was very interesting to read your mother worked in a bank in Boston right before marriage, after divorce worked as a waitress and then worked at another Boston bank until she couldn’t work anymore? Is that right? Dianne: Yeah, she couldn’t work anymore at all. Peter: Now, how many siblings do you have? Dianne: I don’t have any siblings. Peter: Oh, okay. Dianne: I’m an only child. Peter: There’s so many things to go over or talk about branching off of one or another subject or subjects. But is there anything you want to talk about with Queens, growing up, part of your life, part of your life that you thought was the highlight if it, anything? Dianne: Well, I guess, I guess the main that I think is, is I’m very thankful for and I, I feel as though somehow just, it’s by pure luck and, and through knowing my wonderful partner of 33 years. I have been as an artist, I have been incredibly lucky because I, I know have a, a, a full small house and two studio spaces. Most artists in Long Island City don’t live here, they have studios here but they don’t live here. I’m afraid that quite soon artists won’t have studios here any either because the studio buildings are the places where they have studios are going to be eaten up by developers putting up big condominiums and so I feel as though I’m truly blessed to have this kind of space. I have a full house, I have really lovely garden, to be here and, and who would’ve thought in 1983, no one thought, believe me, no one thought that this would be a desirable place to live. It was desirable for me in terms of, certainly in terms of getting to Manhattan. It’s always been desirable from that point of view and I’ve always loved living here, really but as far as being desirable for other people to think that this is now Long Island City is, is this competitor now to various places in Brooklyn is kind of astounding, I think it’s great but it’s kind of astounding and in terms of the arts in Long Island City, I think and the arts in New York in general, I think that artists have had to move farther and farther away, you know the places that artists have, have colonized or had, you can name them, Chelsea, SoHo before that well, you know unless you’re rich as an artist you are not living there, you know, artists don’t live in those places anymore. Let’s go further, let’s go to Williamsburg for example. Artists used to live in Williamsburg too while maybe some still do those that bought buildings back in the 80s maybe or something like that and who have the, are lucky enough to still be there but if you’re a young artist starting out, there’s no way you can live in these places, they’re far too expensive and you can go much farther into Brooklyn, I mean, I don’t even, I don’t know Brooklyn well enough so I’m not going to even talk about that but you can go farther and farther and farther, further into Brooklyn, that’s starting to happen in Queens too which is not necessarily a bad thing but sooner or later the arts which are such an important part of New York City are going to, you know, there, people are literally going to be priced out because people, people who make art need space to make art, it’s not as though, I mean, young people starting out, they can room with other people if they’re not making art, they can room with somebody, they work in an office or something, you know, they’re young, they don’t need to have space very much, they, they can manage but if you’re an artist you really have to have a place, you have to have a place to make art and that’s where I am incredibly blessed. I’ve somehow lucked out, I mean, I didn’t plan it but I am lucky to have this really wonderful, this wonderful house in a very, very good place for me so. Peter: With your art, what do you try or what do you want to make? What is, what is your art, like, what do you do? Dianne: Okay, I’ve done a lot of different things, I’ve certainly started out as a painter. Right, now my work is, is primarily although not entirely, primarily a print base. My downstairs studio has a press in it that’s an etching press and so, that’s another thing, if I didn’t have the space I wouldn’t be able to have an etching press, what I would have to do is like many printmakers, I would have to work in a common workshop, there are a couple, three in Manhattan where I could work. Many, many printmakers do that but it’s certainly nicer having your own press so there’s that but, but so, my work is print based but I make pieces called “monotypes” which are essentially the word “mono” meaning one. Prints that there are no copies of that I make on the etching press which I then develop using other materials, all kinds of other materials, watercolor, pencil, pastels, gloache and so yeah. That’s what my work is now. Peter: Are there any people that you are influenced by? Any artists? Dianne: Oh, many, many, many, although I suppose most of them are not printmakers. One of them is, and, and none of them, I don’t think any of them do work that looks like mine, in the back of you, there’s a thing on the wall from Georgio Mirandee, yeah, the poster and his work is a big influence on me. I suppose early in my career an artist named Joseph Cornell was a big influence on me. He’s an American, I guess an American surrealist although he is much more than that but yeah, so, yeah many, many artists: Edward Manet, is a big influence on my work so. Peter: Did you meet anyone? Any artists that you were wanting to meet within your lifetime so far? Any artists that you wanted to meet? Dianne: You mean people who are famous or something? Peter: Sure, or anyone that you wanted to like meet at a signing or something along those lines? Dianne: Well, I mean, I mean, I’m an artist so I do know other artists, my generation or whatever. I don’t think I know anybody famous, if I did maybe they can get me a gallery. I’m trying to think if there is anybody that I would love to meet. Oh, Jasper Johns, oh if I could meet somebody I guess it would be Jasper Johns, no question it would be Jasper Johns, yeah. Peter: Is he, he a painter? Dianne: He is a painter. Peter: You never know, you never know. Dianne: He’s a, he’s a painter, he’s a really, really well known painter. Peter: Wow. Dianne: He’s pretty famous. Peter: I believe it Dianne: He’s very famous, yup. He’s still alive too, yup. Peter: Well, that’s good. Do you believe there is any new developments coming into Long Island City or within the boro of Queens that will be a positive or negative impact to the people that live here? Dianne: Well, the biggest thing that’s happening, I suppose all over New York, certainly Queens because I think it’s happening seconds to Queens, happened in Brooklyn now it’s happening to Queens, development. Development is happening everywhere. Whether this is going to be positive or negative is still up for grabs although most people, many people here in Long Island City have already made a determination that it’s negative. I’m not sure I totally agree with that, I think it can be positive. If, if the, if the city realizes that people need amenities in terms of transportation, parks, certainly in Queens we don’t, in this part of Queens we badly need parks although one of the great things that the development has done is that, the, we have this really incredibly beautiful park along the river now south of here in Long Island City that we wouldn’t of had before. We wouldn’t of had that park if that development hadn’t taken place so developments have positives and negatives to it. I hope that there will be more positives than we’ve seen so far from the development that’s taking place around here. Well, I guess we’ll see. Peter: Are there any significant events that happened in Long Island City that you remember? Dianne: Significant events... Well now we’re just getting to the part where things happen in Long Island City. I mean nothing has happened in Long Island City for you know, a long time. Now there are especially in this nice, nice park, Gantree Park further south from here there are you know, things that go on especially in the summer, I think there, this is not near where I live so I don’t get there that much but concerts and things like that so I think things like that are just starting to, starting to happen but uncertainly in terms of the art scene the gallery that I’m, Long Island City artists is gotten the, the use of a really wonderful space called the Plaxall Gallery which is down in that area and there are a lot of things going on there. There are plays, various kinds of things that are going in the gallery space in addition to the art shows that go on there, so there are beginning to be things now in Long Island City. Peter: Wonderful. Are there any unique characteristics that you would identify to someone belonging in a certain neighborhood such as like what they wear, the accents, like where they’re from originally or anywhere particular around Long Island City, just the people. Dianne: Well, the people in Long Island City have changed a great deal. For one, they’ve, not news to anybody, but Queens is the most diverse boro. Peter: I can see that. Dianne: And, so, you know, even before the tourists started coming to Long Island City, Queens has almost every ethnic group ever here in Queens and I guess the only thing difference now is that a lot of the people here are on the street or even if I see sometimes on the bus are Europeans, yeah, because they’re coming here, they’re visiting the city and they’re staying in the hotels around here so that’s kind of nice. Peter: Do you believe that within Long Island City the property values are raising due to updating the amount of currency that an individual makes? Dianne: In a word, no. I think property values are increasing because of development and because of new people moving in, but what has happened, the bad part of development somewhat less here because not so many people were living here in the first place but even here on my small block there was a building next to my house that is now torn down that did have 2 or 3 small apartments in it and that was, that had various people living in it who were, I don’t know if they were completely poor as you would define poor, but they certainly were not very well off and that building was sold a number of years ago now to a developer that eventually put in the developed building just being finished now and so those people lost their homes so there’s an example of the fact that, you know, the property value increased a lot and certainly the person, that the owner of the building made a lot of money selling that building but certainly not through any increase and the income from the people that lived there. Peter: Fascinating. Dianne: Very. Sad too. Peter: Are there any unique qualities of the neighborhood in comparison of other parts of New York or the world that you would like to bring to someone’s attention? Dianne: Well, Peter: There are many beautiful things that make NYC the place of people saying that it’s the greatest city in the world or things like that, so with you living in it and me not being as exposed as you were for so many years and me being younger, what qualities of New York would you think? Dianne: Well, yeah, I still love New York, I really do but I lived here long enough to be, I consider myself a real New Yorker even though I wasn’t born here and I’ve certainly lived here long enough to complain as much as any New Yorker about the changes that are happening in the city and by the city I mean, not only Long Island City but Manhattan, the kinds of changes which are exemplified by the Duane Reades, and the CVS’ on every corner and the other corners there are banks and, and the small stores being pushed out, those are changes that I don’t think anybody who has lived here for any length of time likes and I don’t think that, I think there is a sense of sort of like what, what is it possible to do about this. It doesn’t seem that anyone is truly focusing on that because it does seem to me that the, some of the fabric of the city is being lost, that said, nevertheless, there are parts of, I mean New York is a big place, it’s, you know, wonderful as Boston is you can’t have another place where the Metropolitan museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Voorgan, and I could go on are all on in one place. So, you know, have to take the good with the bad. Peter: You mostly do art in your free time right? Dianne: Yeah, since I don’t have a day job anymore. Peter: To kill time, and what makes you happy. Dianne: Oh, well, doing art makes me happy, going to museums and galleries and things like that, I also am able to, since I have free time, I’m able to take a, a, a literature course just for enjoyment. I’m taking a course on Dante’s Purgatorial at the moment at the 92st Y which is really fun, there’s no exams or anything and nobody cares if you do the reading. Peter: Now, that’s what I’m talking about. Dianne: No papers Peter: That’s awesome. Dianne: No, no, no, it’s just for enjoyment and it’s really nice, it’s a lot of fun. Peter: I wish my program was like that. Dianne: I’m sure you do. Peter: Me and every college kid. Dianne: I mean, I remember graduate school, I took a lot of art history courses. Peter: I did also in undergrad and they were tough, and it was tough to even sometimes stay awake and that comes from my personal opinion but some stuff was really cool to be honest. This is really big. Now, since you were a teacher, the assessment of a school with their quality and safety now comparing it to the past is, must be significantly different to you and to teachers of today who are teaching obviously. Now do you see a big difference in the safety of the schools from when you taught to now? Dianne: Well, course, the thing is, I taught in a private school so that, that the, it’s very different than whatever standards there are for, you know for public schools, you know, the building that I, that I taught in you know, in, in terms of public school was pretty small, it was built as a school but still it’s relatively small building. So, I, I can’t really, I guess I’m sorry to say I don’t have any and you know, I haven’t taught anywhere else so, I don’t have an. Peter: It’s a terrible thing to see all these, you know, school shootings and everything on the news so that’s what I was regarding with all the safety measures that were taken and the precautions that they put little kids or kids who are in high school or middle school through so that’s why I wanted to touch on that. Dianne: Yeah, well I, I actually thought recently about you know, you know Spence is a, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side so we always had fairly good security at, at the door but I could imagine that now, probably that’s even more. I can’t imagine, you know, I mean, perhaps now, I, I hope not but maybe they are having active shooter drills, I hope not but you never can tell, maybe they are. I mean, I’m afraid that’s a reality these days. Peter: Do you believe that the education now is more demanding than it was back then for children, kids who are of age is probably, five to eighteen, let’s just say high school. You taught high school? Dianne: Yeah. Peter: Yeah, so, so do you think the education is asking more of the children? Dianne: Well, again I can only speak about Spence since I’ve never… Peter: That’s okay. Dianne: That’s interesting that you should, I, I think that, it’s kind of a hobby horse of mine. I think that far too much of course is heaped on students in demanding schools like Spence. Those things are essentially resume building to get into college and the pressure to do well in all things and to have the all things be more and more is pretty strong and I think that I saw that increase during the time that I was teaching. So that, the free time that a student had to pursue an interest or think even about something that might be of an interest outside of a programmed course or activity or sport was limited and there are only so many hours in the day and even kids that are incredibly smart and the kids that I taught were incredibly smart. They only have so much energy and they only have so much. There’s only so much time and so that’s the only thing that I see. I think, I think the demands of perhaps, parents to a great degree for getting their kids into good colleges puts an enormous amount of pressure on people to do, to do well at everything. First of all, to do everything and then to do well at everything and I think that’s really unfortunate. I think that there’s, you know, I don’t, I don’t see any. People talk about, least they used to talk about when I was there, they used to talk about oh well, we have to, we have to cut back, we have to have people make choices and not, not think that they can do everything but that never happened somehow, that just never happened because people always, it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, somehow, you always want to do more since you can do more, you do do more and when you do do more you want to do it well. At least if you’re in excellent school, you’ll want to do it more, well and more. It’s, it’s, it’s more leads to better, better leads to more leads to better, it’s a never ending and I just think that’s really unfortunate but Peter: Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? Dianne: I don’t think so. Peter: Okay, well, this concludes our interview on Friday, October 12, 2018. Once again, my name is Peter Mari and I am sitting here with Dianne Martin and thank you very much. Dianne: Oh, thank you, been very enjoyable. Peter: Greatly appreciate this. Dianne: Thank you. ",
  "Martin_J-Alexander_timecode.txt": "Amna: Okay so this is me starting the recording. it is Saturday May 17 2016. I'm at home. I�m going to call J Alexander Martin for our second interview. [He did not pick up] He was apparently busy. so I guess we are just going to wait. [J Alexander Martin calls back] J Alexander Martin: This makes me old Amna: Hi J Alexander Martin: Hey what�s up? Amna: I�m good. How are you? J Alexander Martin: I'm alright Amna: Can you hear me? J Alexander Martin: Yeah yeah. I�m just ailing here. The pills and the medicine and all that stuff. Ow Amna: How are you feeling?! J Alexander Martin: Old. Old to say the least J Alexander Martin: Ok shoot while I�m not in the pain, well I am in pain but not as much in the pain. If I keep walking I can walk it off. What�s up? Amna: Ok, Do you want to do it some other time when you�re not in pain? J Alexander Martin: No no, just do it now and get it out of the way. Because you said you had to have it done by Monday. Just go ahead and shoot so you can have it done by Monday. Amna: Ok, I don�t want you to be in pain though J Alexander Martin: Nah nah, that�s life. Amna: Ok. Let's start with. I was looking over the recording from the last session and we were talking a lot about black identity, black culture but what was your definition of black identity, black culture or just culture in general? J Alexander Martin: My definition of black culture in general. Well I thought of it as something like this, like when I was coming up you know as a youth, as a youth just listen to me.... As being young, you don't know what you want to be, you don't know what you want to do, so whatever's popular becomes, whatever�s popular that�s around you like if its music influence, you know, writing influence, what people are wearing, you become a product of your environment. I think that by definition culture is the product of your environment, whatever is around that�s popular and present and you just become that. You engulf yourself in that. And actually it�s like a following something. and when I say following something usually follow what is hot, or what is not, or what everyone is actually doing, and that becomes culture. I haven't In that respect I have engulfed myself in fashion. It�s what I felt I was good at. Music of course is always in fashion as well but I wasn't the best rapper or the greatest musician, so I just chose what I like to do. I used to change my clothes a lot. I would want to buy clothes and shoes and look good, look a certain way. When you look a certain way you attract certain things. If it is women, or people looked at you a certain way. And they could tell you had power. You were in the �In Crowd�. That to me is what makes up culture. it could be culture in respect of religion it could be culture in respect to your environment or where you grew up, anything like that. I don't know if I answer the question but I know I sort of tried to Amna All I can ask for. You said culture for you was a lot of the environment, what was going around you, and stuff. Do you want to talk about what was going on around that time like not just FUBU but your childhood and everything? J Alexander Martin When you grow up, who's the most popular kid? And the most popular kid is the person who pretty much had money or how they got their money, or it is really that one �in kid�. Who is the valedictorian, who is the pretty�s woman, or the guy that looks the nicest, he becomes the popular guy, and everyone wants to be like them because everybody wants to emulate that. And that�s what happens. That�s how culture impacts everything, it impacts style, it impacts trends, it impacts all that. Trends push you or leads you into whatever that is, everybody all of a sudden, the in car when I was growing up was like a Jetta, if you had moderate money, not a whole bunch of money but moderate money. And then Lexus came and then all of a sudden now it�s the car to have. And everybody wanted to have that car. If it was a style that you wore or jeans or whatever everybody had to have that jean. I grew up wearing timberlands because I�m from queens. You can identify who a person is or where they are from or what they like or don�t like based on what they look like. Amna Do you mind expanding on the fact that you wore Tims because you were in Queens, like did different boroughs have different... J Alexander Martin Well, like you know what happened, it was funny, you know who�s who, who somebody is and where they are from based on how they dressed. Because everybody�s dresses a certain way in a certain area Amna I get what you mean J Alexander Martin so , so if/ when you walk outside your house and you saw the older kids, and they had on A then u needed to have that somehow, and you did whatever you had to do, work nights, sweep, shovel snow, or work in the summer or whatever so when school came around you had the hottest or most popular clothing. And the people who didn�t have all that they just weren�t in the �in crowd�, they were not the �good guys� they wasn�t hot or they wasn�t cool I should say. So everybody the whole thing about trying to be cool, trying to be �in�, and I think that�s what everybody grows up trying to be. Until they find themselves and find out who they are and that is just who they are and making their own trend and doing what they want to do and having people go towards them. There are always the nerds, the thug not thug but the ghetto guy or whatever who everybody is like wow, the drug dealers or whoever, and everybody is like �wow I wanna be just like them� and years after that when all those guys are in jail then you like, well I�m glad I didn�t want to be like that, I wasn�t like that because I would be in jail or dead�. Because women always want the bad guy, the bad boy rather I should say, and then everybody�s wanted that. And if you see that and that�s the culture that you live in and you wake up and that�s what you see all day that that�s what everybody wants and that�s what you want to be. Amna That makes sense. J Alexander Martin Everybody wants to grow up and get the best car, for me it was like the big car and stuff like that, everybody wanted that. I think I answered the question, sorry. Amna Yea, no you make sense, um basically everybody wants to be included, basically. J Alexander Martin Included yea. And that dictates culture I think more so than people even think about it. you know, when you finally start making a bunch of money the first think you do is you go and you purchase something that you may not even really be able to afford, you can sort of afford it. And you gona get it because that�s what you always wanted because you are searching for. Something in your past that you couldn�t be, you know Amna Yea I get you. That makes sense J Alexander Martin Which is a detriment, It could be a detriment, to that person. now everyone nowadays I think people don�t even really look, we they do but it is not a prevalent as it used to be where people just fall into a trend and follow. Although they follow in a different way, today everyone follows on social media. The whole thing is that I don�t really notice the same thing about it but if you are driving on the highways and you come to a like a toll, if you notice that everybody goes on the line that�s the longest. And then if you look to the left half the time there is a line that is short but nobody goes to the line because everybody just follows. You notice if you go into a bank or whatever and you walk in and people just go into the line that everybody�s on and don�t look for the line that nobody is on. If you walking down the block, and you look up in the air one day and act like you are looking at something, then all of a sudden somebody goanna come and look and look at something, and you aint lookin at nothing but they are trying to find what you are looking at and after a while you have 15-20 people looking up in the air looking for something that isn�t there because that is just naturally how people think/act. There is this whole reality world, a reality star could act in this way that is sort of real but is also acting, everybody looks at this and decides that it is ultimately what they want to do, there is a whole subculture like that, I know some women who quit their job to go work a dance club or strip club, I don�t know what they call it now, because these girls all you had to do is kinda walk around with scantly clothes on and all of a sudden they are making 5,000 dollars a night or more, so it�s like �I could just go out in a night and make more money in a day than I make in a month� it becomes a people, who go wow this is it, with social media you can broadcast that out to more people and then become popular. And when you become popular you have hundreds of thousands of people maybe even millions of people who like your pictures or you have like hundreds of thousands of followers and now all of a sudden you go off and now you are wanted to be �look I want you to come host this party�, now you are making 5,000 a night at a party, just as a host or just to show up. And then in turn from there it can maybe turn, if you have any kind of personality it might turn you to television, or then you might date this superstar or athlete or whatever and then she makes you even more popular. Back in the day it was like they had PR agents who would turn around and when something goes wrong they would spin it to where it�s right. But now it doesn�t matter because why spin it to its right, if they are talking about you, if they aren�t talking about you than your not hot, if it�s not popping you�re not hot, if people stop talking about you then whether it is bad or good it isn�t helping you. Amna Any publicity is good publicity J Alexander Martin Any publicity is good publicity, which is really in the long run, bad because if things happen so fast, today they on you and tomorrow they off you. People don�t look at the long haul of it and, if you are known for something right, how can you keep it going forever, if people hate you or your do something that�s crazy what�s it gonna do for you in the longer room when you have kids or you do this or you do that. Whereas another thing I�ve always looked at, when you see women, when you look at someone that is, and I�m just talking about women in general at this point, if you look at women 50 years from now and you have grandkids and all that, and you have all these pictures on the internet with you with nothing on looking a little bit this way, and you look 50 years before that you see your grandmother and she looks nice and oh look at my grandmother and 50 years later this generations grandmothers gonna look like half naked or with a thousand tattoos on her. And what is that gonna do for, just because, there is no limit to anything anymore, to what people would do just to be famous. And that becomes the problem when it becomes to culture, when culture has no respect for itself it�s a detriment to society when they are no rules no regulations no, ok �that�s bad or that�s good�, when everything is no matter what is bad or good, YOLO �you only live once�, �just do it, just do it� yea but if you only live once, why mess it up, you have to have something, some type of guidelines, something you want to do. You know what I mean? Amna Yea that makes sense J Alexander Martin That�s one of the things that really bothers me when I think of culture and think of what�s going on today vs. when you used to be able to choose and say that not everything can be good. What�s going to happen if you have a daughter, when your daughter grows up thinking that all of this is ok, and then what their kids do, and what their kids do, and then when you see on Facebook little kids looking exactly like their father with their jeans sagging and all that stuff and they are 10 and they�re emulating the boyfriend that cheated on em and don�t want �em anymore, it�s like � what are you doing� what happens to the generation to come, that�s what you are starting from. That�s a little problematic but it is what it is Amna Yea, um, do you mind if we flip switches and talk about music. Because I remember in the beginning you mentioned about music and culture. So I was wondering what was the role of music in Fubu? J Alexander Martin What was the role of music in Fubu? Well music, back when we first started when we were doing stuff with music, music and fashion kinda go hand in hand. because the actual musicians like rappers or singer or whatever they, music makes people come together you know, and the music artist becomes popular because their hit records and are really good and everybody wants to wear or look like that particular artist. So what we would so is we would make alliances with that particular artist and make sure they have our clothing and things of that nature. And we would become popular so long as he is popular. See that comes to a detriment too because when nobody likes the artist anymore then nobody likes their clothes especially of that artist was really really big. Amna Yeah that makes sense. So like what would you do when, if one person was like really high and then ended up falling down what would you, as a Fubu Brand do? J Alexander Martin What we do is, we would try to have multiple people. And Switch and be able to have different other guys fill in. As one goes down one goes back up. You know Amna Ok, that makes sense. Um yeah another question based off of our last interview. We were talking a lot about roots and stuff. So What? Amna About roots and holding on to your past. So what were your roots as a person? J Alexander Martin (21:43) Well, I mean my roots, its kind of weird with me. With My roots, I�m adopted so I was raised with a mother and a father, although I was adopted. Um and my roots became their roots. My father he always had a really good job, professional. My mother she was like an entrepreneur and worked much harder then I know. And so my roots were more family oriented. And that is what happened when you from Queens because Queens�s people had houses and most of them had more tight knit families, because you had a backyard and things like that. So queens was more family oriented then other areas. In which it was problematic because you were in the projects per say or living in really really bad neighborhoods. And the mother you know was never around or the father was never around. I never had that problem. So you know it wasn�t no absentee this absentee that. You get raised by seeing families. And then when you date people as you get older. When you start looking for people who have the same like minds. When it comes to groups Amna Ok. Do you want to talk more about like childhood? I didn�t know that you were adopted. That was, I didn�t know that. Did you have other adopted siblings or anything? J Alexander Martin (23:08)I had one adopted brother as well and but um he died though. But I was way more in, when I say culture he was in another frame of mind when it comes to culture. Like my brother he was on Broadway. He was a Broadway Dancer. So it and my father and he would always make sure we learned, we did other things besides just you know, that we knew that the world was bigger than our block. You know what I mean. And what happens is when you are stuck in just your surroundings. You can�t see the other things. You just think that that�s it. Like your surroundings are all bad and that is why you think that you have been raised all bad, you know. You don�t know that there are other things around you. That there is a big world around you. Like we, my father would say hey listen let�s try his or try that and eat this type of food and this as well. I remember this story where we had a musical label at the time and we were on tour. And at the end of the tour I took the whole bus, we had a bus, to a restaurant that I knew of and I had the chef cook for us. So we pull up there and a couple of guys didn�t want to get off the bus. Because they didn�t want to eat there. And I�m like well why don�t you want to eat there? Oh I don�t eat there, that�s bougie. Nothing is bougie its food. You don�t what the food? They were so used to you know, they didn�t feel comfortable in their environment because from where they came from that was the thing, you were trying to be something other than yourself. It�s not a matter of you trying to be something other than yourself, it�s trying to expand and grow. And know there are other things to go uptown to be able to go downtown and still be the same person. A lot of people they don�t understand in life that if you go to a wedding, or a certain event of do certain things you dress accordingly, or you act accordingly or whatever. A lot of people they just say forget it they are going to take me for me. And that is not the truth because there are still different thing that happen in different areas. Like if I went to Israel I can�t I�m not going to walk in there and talk about what is this, and act a certain way because you act accordingly to what your environment is. A lot of people growing up now a days they don�t do that. �You are going to take me as I am� and that�s that. I understand your point but if take me as I am is your personality but other than that you still need to respect, because there is no respect anymore of what that situation is. You know you walk into somebody�s house, or you are going to an event or a party or someone�s house you bring a gift or a something. A lot of people just come in and whatever. �Aight, I�m here, now what?� You know there is a lot of manners and a lot of when before your neighbors would used to police you. Now no one polices anybody. You just do what you want to do. And there is no respect for family and respect for life and respect for anything. I mean people just off on their own. And doing what they want to do. But everybody can�t do what they want to be because there has to be some type of order and there is no order anymore, at least in my book. I think I went off to the left again, and im going to go back to the right ok ( 27:18) Amna Its ok I sort of want to talk more about you parents. Is that ok? J Alexander Martin Yeah that�s fine Y Amna ou said that, what did your father do? J Alexander Martin My father worked at a compact called the depository trust company. And he was, he started as a clerk and worked all the way up to being vice president of the company. So he started on the bottom and worked all the way to the top then retired. Amna Nice J Alexander Martin From that you see what it means to grow and to work hard and to achieve and understand with that in mind to go every day and every day and working that pavement and moving it and seeing value in yourself. Now my mother she pretty much had her own business so that become the entrepreneurial spirit. The go go go go. Now with me being adopted, there is always a problem with anyone that is adopted where you always feel abandonment and you always feel a certain way. You know and stuff like that. And you need real structured family a structured environment to go out there, to sustain life and be able to go on because it is so hard for that person to. When you grow up being adopted you just always feel that you want to be by yourself and stuff because you felt like you were abandoned. So it was great to have 2 people that would love you like, as if they were your own. It keeps you grounded and keep you movin (2913) Amna How old were you when you were adopted? J Alexander Martin I think, when I was finally adopted I must have been around 6, 5 or 6. I was back and forth in the system but I was back and forth with the system and I came back to the with to same family luckily. I didn�t have to go to different families. Amna Ok cool. Do you have any pictures? Like an old family picture? J Alexander Martin I�d have to look. I know I have something. You know what you could do though. Can I give you my Instagram? You could just look through it, I have a bunch of old pictures on there. You are going to have to scroll down of course but and then you can copy and take it from there. Amna Ok J Alexander Martin Or maybe I can find it for you. It is, my Instagram is AFashionMind. The letter A fashion m-i-n-d. Amna Ok J Alexander Martin Or even maybe it�s on Facebook too if you could check that. Facebook, just look under my name J Alexander Martin maybe you could find that Amna Ok J Alexander Martin Either one of those two. And you could just pull whatever you need to pull. Or you could just google it. My name and it will come up. Amna That would work. Thank you. Um yeah. You said your mother was an entrepreneur. What did she do actually? What was her business? (30;52) J Alexander Martin She owned, in all of her time she owned her own secretarial business. Like she would be the back end of someone�s business and do all the secretarial work. Amna Oh ok, cool. Yeah Amna Um who are your child hood influences or idols? J Alexander Martin You know what I don�t have that. And that is the weirdest thing. People always you know when they have the speeches and all of that stuff, or my mentor was this. I don�t have that. I don�t look for mentors I don�t do none of that. I just go, go go go go. And that becomes a power that you have when you are adopted because you have a, there is a sense of isolation, so you have to do it or else. And that is just you. You try, you always try to do something. To be honest I think you do that because you want to make that, your mother that gave you up, or your father that gave you up, or both of them that gave you up, notice you. You want to make so much noise, you want to be seen so much that that they have to know you. And you feel either A) they didn�t make a bad choice or 2) they try to find me. You know. Amna I get you. That makes sense. J Alexander Martin And the part of that too is when they don�t, sometimes they don�t even look for you. And that becomes the problem. And that becomes kinda hidden and deep down till it keeps you going. Just like there is a saying that says that there are people who go through a whole lot and they are usually the ones that achieve and become millionaires. And all that stuff like that. And that is how everyone looks at achievement, I am not a millionaire but, you know, they do that because their back is against the wall and they really they just keep going because they want to get out of their situation. Whereas if you already have a situation you know you don�t even go that hard because you just don�t. Cuz you pretty much have it already. (33:23) Amna Ok we were talking about how your dad would always go out and try different things and how one of the people that you were on tour with thought it was really weird and really bougie because that is not what they did. Did you have a community of people who J Alexander Martin He would always say you have to be able to go up town and down town. He wasn�t raised you know like, I was about to say with a silver spoon, but he was raised a way where he didn�t have a whole bunch of stuff. He was just a worker. You know he worked and worked and worked. And he tried to keep up, keep a roof over our heads to stay, and you know he always says, when he bought his house it was 200 dollars a month and he made less than that a month. You know. It was hard. But he kept going and kept going and kept going. So Amna Did he buy the house and work so hard for you? J Alexander Martin No not for me. I mean this is when I was growing up. Back then. And we would go to dinners. He would say listen, we would save up money and go to dinner and go to a Chinese restaurant or we would go to a Vietnamese restaurant, or we would go to a Greek restaurant. We would try caviar and things like that just to know there is things out there, more than just what you see every day. The chicken wings and whatever. You know what I mean. Amna For the experience J Alexander Martin To get you out of the norm. So you could you know. And when I went to the military you know I got to travel and see the world and see different things, and that made me a lot more worldly you know. He always made sure we were worldly. You know. I can go into a place where I can sit with the president of the United States and then I can go up to a place you know even more that. And where people just, like the guy was in jail yesterday, you know what I mean. You have to be able to do that so you can relate to a lot of people. Or to more than just you know. More than just your age group or people. (36:18) Amna That makes sense J Alexander Martin Its like when we sat there and talked and we were talking about, I�m going to mess the name up again, what is it called? The thing, the sari, ansairi, what is it called? Amna The hijab? J Alexander Martin Yeah, the thing, the thing you put on your head? What is it called again? Amna Yeah it�s called a hijab J Alexander Martin Hijab, right, hijab, right, that. The average person won�t know what it is, they will be like �Why is she wearing that?� Oh she is Arab. You know what I mean. Just because they don�t open themselves up to other things. They are just closed minded. And I didn�t grow up like that, to be closed minded, you know. To know more than just what is put in front of your face. Amna That was really smart of your parents. To open you up like that J Alexander Martin And that actually helped me because I am more of the creative director when it comes to that road later on when I took over that role in fashion when I stopped having a design, I would be the creative director for a team of designers. And that kept me worldly and open and able to know what is going to happen before it happens. Because it is not just I am looking at the group, or my own niche per say. Urban. I can bring other things to urban that people not even thinking of. And I can create other designs that it�s like wow, that is different, or that is hot, or that is this. It�s not different it is just what you are not used to because you only see what you see because your eyes are closed. We did a line called Crown Holder and the line was based off of medieval times, and I would pick a lot of different periods in time like the 1500s, the 1600, the revolution, you know. And I would take concepts for that and when I did it first people were like wow this is crazy, this is totally different and people would love it. And because I had vision. It was more than just a pair of jeans, that everyone else wears. Amna That�s really cool. J Alexander Martin And then you could have conversations with people you normally wouldn�t have and be able in situations and handle yourself in an appropriate level you know. (3909) Amna Would you mind talking about basically like childhood and stuff? Like how was school for you? J Alexander Martin Um school was different. School wasn�t the greatest in my book. Because with all that, your parents, trying to be someone, when you didn�t know who you are. You are searching and running and you are just kind of following um so you know I wound up being friends with my partner now, who is Daymond. I was just pretty much under his shadow and just around. And I dint even know who I was and I�m just trying to be popular or something. And I never was super popular but I would just be known. You know just because I happened to be around. I didn�t think. I don�t think, my child hood to me, a lot of the time I couldn�t do the things that everyone else could do that were popular because i couldn�t really go anywhere. I couldn�t go and hang out all night, I didn�t have the money to where this type of clothes and that type of clothes, so I was trying to search, I finally found a job and I was able to buy my own stuff. And when I was able to do that I was able to start being a little more somebody, trying to be more of a somebody instead of a nobody. Um not that my family was super strict it was more of I wasn�t the great�s student and everything was hell bent around doing well in school. And I wasn�t the greatest student you know. So the only time I got to do anything or really enjoy myself was in school and on the way home from school. When I got in the house it was that�s it. I would be to myself a lot when I got home, just sit in a room , reflect and keep thinking what I want to be and what I�m going to do and where I am going to go. And it is really weird even to this day I am sort of a loner but I am not a loner. I can just kind of sit in the room and just sit there and do nothing and I think that because I didn�t get to do anything much, which wasn�t the greatest. I think as soon as you get older and you start to get to do the things that you couldn�t do, you know what happens with child hood too is that all the things you can�t do or couldn�t be or whatever. Here is another way to say it. Life is in stages there is the popular, there is the kid that�s this, there is the kid that is that, right. That same person will have all that then, but in their 20s and 30s and 40�s and stuff like that then they are not that anymore. So you have to pick, which one do you want to be, you want to sacrifice now for later or you wana get it all now. You know like, there is nothing wrong with enjoying yourself, there is nothing wrong with doing certain things but you still have to focus on what you want to do on the longer run. Most of the time when we are kids and we are young and I didn�t really understand about focusing on the long run, the long hull because you are thinking of, you are just thinking of today. And I think there is a problem in general that everyone needs to learn early of not just thinking of today but also thinking of the future. Amna Ok so what did you want to do in the future as a kid? J Alexander Martin No I didn�t even know till late. And then I was like ok I want to be in fashion. And once I really said I want to be in fashion, that is what I want to do, I went for it. Amna Like how old were you? Around when you figures out you want to be in fashion? J Alexander Martin I was in, I had to be 17,18,19,20,21, something like that. Amna Ok so like late teens early 20s J Alexander Martin Late teens , late teens yeah Amna Ok, cool. Like what would you do for fun? What would the other kids do for fun? And what would you do for fun, as a kid? J Alexander Martin Say that again Amna As a kid what would you do for fun vs what would the other people do for fun? Because you said you would stay home by yourself and not really do much J Alexander Martin Well no because e I couldn�t go anywhere. Half of the time I was on punishment because my grades wasn�t good or something. Other than that I had 2 sisters and an older brother, and I said he was into dance and theater, and I wasn�t into dance or theater so, you know. And I had 2 sisters and I wasn�t about to you know play with my sisters so I just sat in the room. Amna I had a question about that but I just forgot it so� that happens. What was the grade limit hat your parents were like ok you need to have this much grade or like you can�t go out? J Alexander Martin It was all grades. Amna Ok J Alexander Martin Pretty much, because they were really into you have to go to school, you have to have an education, and that led you to be somebody. You have to prepare, you have to study and I was like aait that doesn�t mater to me Amna Ok, did you have any favorite TV shows or movies from when you were a kid? J Alexander Martin Um no, you know what�s weird is that I didn�t really, no not really, because a lot of times, I kind of lived in a bubble because i didn�t know, because i would always sit. And when I was at home by myself, I just wanted to be alone by myself, it�s not like I would go off and, because i would always want to escape so I was always, my mind is weird because i was always tired, I was just tired. That isn�t to say I was tired because i was sleepy but I was just tired because I didn�t what I wanted to do, I didn�t know, I was in a situation where I wants growing. And I dint know that you were supposed to be growing. All I knew was that I had to get up and go to school and then the only time I was enjoying myself was when I went to school. And then you come home and watch tv, but then my sisters would actually have all the rights to the tv because there were 2 of them against 1. So I had to watch what they wanted to watch so there was never anything where oh god I really want to watch this because even if I wanted to watch it I couldn�t watch it because it was 2 against 1 Amna Were your sisters older then you or younger? J Alexander Martin One was older and one was younger but the one that was older would just kind of, what she wanted to do everyone had to do. Amna She was the boss J Alexander Martin Yeah Amna How much older and younger were they? One is like 2 years older and actually hold oh [it went quiet for a bit] Hello, ok yeah J Alexander Martin So one of my sister was 2 years older than you and one is my age\\ Amna And your brother? J Alexander Martin My brother was like 5 years older than me. My relationship with him. Like I said he was off doing, he was older so like, Amna He was off doing his own thing. J Alexander Martin He was into dance, theater, he was in plays, and stuff like that so there was no hey what�s up bro, and all of that. Just kind of keep it moving when it came to him. Amna Did you have no hobbies at all? J Alexander Martin What was that? Amna Like what were your hobbies? J Alexander Martin I mean finally when I got to, I mean I tried to be a rapper like anybody else, and I tried that for a while, I didn�t rely keep going with that, and that was really it. Other than that I didn�t really have any hobbies or anything like that. Anything I would try I would stop in 2 seconds you know. It wasn�t till I got out of my house, go into the military, got out of the military, and started in 20, 21, 22 when I started to have a life you know what I mean. Because before I would try to figure out what to doing. Right. And after that when I supposedly had a life it started becoming a Fubu life. Which was a whole entertainment, you had to become something that you really wasn�t. And then you were consumed with being a celebrity and all of that stuff. And that becomes a whole nother thing. Running around and Amna How did that effect you? J Alexander Martin I mean you get caught up. You get caught up and stuff like that. You get up trying to keep up with the Jones�s and do the certain things, and once you do one thing and all of a sudden you get. It�s almost like a women, she puts on a dress with cleavage and something and all the guys are looking at her like wow, wow, wow she is going to make sure every where she goes that she is going to find that dress. She is going to put that on because she likes that you know, you start to like that. And as you grow and start gaining popularity people start acting accordingly and you lose who you are. And with me I probably never figured out who I was. I mean now a days I am starting to figure it out, and it is not till I am in my 40s that I figured out. You know what I mean Amna Yeah everyone tries so hard to get to that level but when you are there its� not all you think it is. It�s not all its cut out to be J Alexander Martin Yeah defiantly. It was all great, but then you are just trying to keep up, keep it up and you start wanting things that makes no sense. Like I know a friend of mine, it�s a women, she is all caught up in what she is doing and then when the film is over and it is back to being regular then she is a whole different person. So when she is going to go and do it she is somebody else. And then it�s like I need to get this jet. What do you need a jet for? Yeah you fly around here and there but what the hell do you need a jet? You don�t need a jet unless you have billions of dollars, you know millions of dollars to have your own jet. But why is your goal to have your own jet? Somethings just do not make sense on a level that you are in, or on rather. And when you are in this container everyone is doing as, everyone is trying to one up somebody. You want the biggest house and the biggest this and this car and that car and all you are doing is putting yourself more and more in debt. More and more in, and you are trying to push to get stuff, push to be like people who honestly you shouldn�t even want to be. You should just want to be happy. I mean what is going to happen if you have none of that, you are not happy. Where is that? But no I need, and I need, like it�s almost like different worlds on the show and a different world in. There was a character Whitney and this other guy, and I can�t remember the other guy�s name. and she is like miss bougie and whatever and he is like the regular guy and they were dating and one of the things, she was stressing like, well what do you want, what do you want. Well what this, this, this this, and this. Well why do you want that? And that guy is rich and guys like that are always rich and it�s like what happens if you turn around and you freaking lose everything you got. Is the guy supposed to leave you then? Are you going to leave? It just becomes you are chasing money, money, you chase it and you chase it, you chase money, and you chase power and that�s all good but then you get it. Now what? People don�t have an answer for that. And when you don�t have it nobody cares. So basicly you need to find somebody that loves you for you and after that comes all of ",

  "Mattos_Tania_timecode.txt": "Tania Mattos was born in La Paz, Bolivia in 1983. She moved to Jackson Heights, Queens with her family in 1987 at the age of 4. Tania had many happy memories of growing up in a diverse community in Jackson Heights where she had extended family. Tania attended college at SUNY FIT and graduate school at CUNY Brooklyn College. During graduate school, she began working in immigrants’ rights and organizing around the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act. Currently, Tania works at Unlocal, an organization that provides legal services to immigrants. She is the co-founder of the volunteer organization Queens Neighborhoods United which works against displacement, gentrification, and police abuse in the community, specifically in Jackson Heights, Corona, and Elmhurst. Tania hopes for Queens to continue to be a welcoming, supportive place for new immigrants. Tania and her husband live in Jackson Heights 00:00:35 Tania was born in La Paz, Bolivia on September 18, 1983. 00:00:48 Tania came to Queens in December 1987 when she was 4 years old. Two of Tania’s aunts came to the United States and lived in Jackson Heights. Tania’s father came to the US first (“crossed the border”) and lived here for 1 year preparing for his family to come. Tania, her Mom, and her brother were able to come to the US on a VISA. Tania vividly remembers arriving in the United States, first flying into Miami and then LaGuardia Airport. Tania was reunited with her Father for the first time in a year and didn’t recognize him. Tania and he family lived with her Aunt on 82nd and 34th Ave. for 1-2 months before getting their own apartment at 90th St. Tania went to a bi-lingual pre-school where she learned English and went to Kindergarten at PS (Public School) 62. Tania’s family moved around Jackson Heights, living at 90th St. for about 5-4 years until Tania was 10 or 11 year old, moving back to 82nd St. for about 10 years before moving to 89th St. between 34th and 35th Avenue. Tania lived in New Orleans around 2012/2013. She then met her husband who was from Astoria and they moved to Jackson Heights, where they currently reside on 81st St. between Roosevelt and 37th Ave. 00:06:11 Tania felt that Jackson Heights was an amazing place to grow up. She loved being surrounded by her immediate and extended family, and had cousins around her age. She has memories of barbeques in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and playing outside all the time in the summer. She and her friends would put on shows for people in the street. Fourth of July was her favorite holiday and it was legal to purchase fireworks. She felt that PS 69 was a great school. She loved her teachers and classmates and was exposed to many cultures and foods – South Asian, Asian, Latin American, Eastern European. 00:08:40 Tania felt that middle school was harder for her, as she believes it is for most children. Tania went to PS 145. She became exposed to gang activity in the community. Some people she considered friends joined gangs. She felt that they were good people, but wanted the acceptance of being in a gang. She also liked boys, which made things difficult. However, Tania remembers having amazing teachers and that she especially enjoyed the Home Ec classes. 00:10:09 Tania went to Flushing High School where she had a great time and had good friends. 00:10:28 Tania went to college at SUNY FIT, staying in NYC. September 11 happened while she was in college and she remembers this as a difficult time. She was supposed to be in school that day but did not go after she saw the events on the news. She describes taking the 7 train that day as a traumatic experience. Afterward, there were bomb scares every week at her downtown college. 00:11:09 Tania went to graduate school at CUNY Brooklyn College, a long commute from her home to Flatbush, Brooklyn. During this time, Tania became involved in working for immigrants’ rights inspired by her own family and many other immigrants she knew. She participated in organizing around the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act. 00:11:47 Tania shared other memories of special places and institutions in Queens. She visited Travers Park (then called 79th St. Park) a lot when she was in elementary school. During the summer, Tania’s father (who worked nights) would take her to the Jackson Heights Library on 81st St. and museums in Manhattan during the day when her mother was working. Tania is a fan of Queens Library and is amazed by the way it has evolved. She used to do research projects on type writers and later computers at the library. She also used to frequent two movie theaters, one on 82nd St., one north of Roosevelt and one south of Roosevelt. As a teenager, she liked visiting the theater north of Roosevelt because she would get pizza afterward at a nearby pizza shop. Certain businesses where she would get pizza or ice cream every week were institutions. She visited different parts of Jackson Heights, Corona, and Elmhurst. Her family liked going to Blockbuster/Leisure video and would go on Tuesday or Thursday because the videos were half-off. In high school, she visited Queens Center Mall a lot. She also remembers parades which came later. 00:15:27 Tania works at an organization called Unlocal which provides legal services to immigrants. They provide free legal representation and work on cases including asylum cases, special immigrant juvenile status, and affirmative applications. Unlocal has a special program for LGBTQ youth of color and a program for access to higher education. They do community presentations on immigration law which is complex. 00:16:33 Tania is the co-founder of the volunteer organization Queens Neighborhoods United which works against displacement, gentrification, and police abuse in the community, specifically in Jackson Heights, Corona, and Elmhurst. Tania feels that Queens Neighborhoods United has done amazing work, including preventing a mall from being constricted at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and stopping the expansion of a business improvement dis trict on 82nd St. that would have converted to Jackson Heights-Corona Business Improvement District and displaced local businesses. Queens Neighborhoods United is in the midst of a campaign against a Target which is supposed to be built on 82nd St. Now, the building will be 2 stories instead of 13. The case has gone back and forth, but Queens Neighborhoods United will continue to challenge the development. 00:19:56 Tania believes the most important job of Queens Neighborhoods United is to educate the community on what’s going on in terms of displacement. The organization believes that displacement and gentrification do not happen accidentally. They are caused by speculation and laws created by the elected City Council members. Queens Neighborhoods United works on building its base and works with street vendors on Roosevelt Avenue. The New York Times recently referred to this area as a “corridor of vice”, which Tania believes is racist. Tania took a tour at the Tenement Museum focused on street vendors and she found that similar anti-vendor language was used in the early history of New York. Street vendors have long-standing ties in the community, and Queens Neighborhoods United advocates for them. 00:21:58 Before the recent election, Tania felt that past representatives weren’t advocating for the community and even criminalized community members. Senator José Peralta spoke negatively about the community in the media and advocated for a heavier police presence. Tania advocates for alternative solutions, such as restorative justice. Tania feels that Senator Peralta did not address community needs, such as poverty and immigration issues, that negatively impact the community. Tania feels that Senator Peralta, New York City Council Member Francisco Moya, and Congressperson Joseph Crowley represent their own interests rather than those of the community. 00:23:41 Queens Neighborhoods United does not partner with many other organizations. They are not a non-profit 501(c)3 organization and they feel they need to speak out about problems and not cover them up. Queens Neighborhoods United does collaborate with DRUM (Desis Rising Up and Moving), which advocates for the Desis community. Chhaya CDC, an economic non-profit center for the South Asian community, and IMI (Immigrant Movement International) Corona are other organizations with whom they collaborate. Tania reports that Congressperson Danny Drum has congratulated Queens Neighborhoods United on their work, but they feel he is not as outspoken about gentrification as he could be. 00:24:58 Queens Neighborhoods United works closely with the Community Boards, especially Community Board 4. They are supportive, and Queens Neighborhoods United tries to educate them on on-going developments. Tania mentions that the Queens Tech Hub is on their radar. She travelled to Seattle with other QNU members and met with Seattle activists who told them that major corporations - Amazon, Google, Boeing, Microsoft – control their city. Queens Neighborhoods United is concerned about this happening to Queens if they become the next major tech hub, specifically the neighborhoods of Long Island City and Sunnyside Yards. Many politicians are in favor of it. Queens Neighborhoods United is concerned about the impact on the community, especially for lower class immigrant women. Tech hubs will bring in more affluent workers from overseas. 00:26:46 Reflecting on changes in the community, Tania expresses that in Jackson Heights, the Garden District was the only area in which you would see older white people. Now, the community is more diverse and every 10 years there’s another wave of people coming. While Indians used to be prominent in the community, now Bangladeshi, Nepalis, and Tibetans are more prominent. There used to be a large number of Colombians and Dominicans, and now there are larger Ecuadorian and Mexican communities. 00:27:57 Jackson Heights has a larger police presence today than when Tania was a child, and there has been a trend in criminalizing loitering and being on the street. The 115th precinct has had one of the highest rates of issuing summons in NYC, including giving out tickets for street vending and muffler noise. In 2012, the 115th precinct had the 3rd highest rate of stop and frisk in NYC. Queens Neighborhoods United works with an organization Cop Watch Jackson Heights whose members walk around at night to monitor police interactions. Sometimes police have given out tickets for things that didn’t happen, lied, or not offered translation services. The 115th precinct reported only having 2 officers on staff who spoke languages other than English. Also, people can be arrested for their immigration status. NYC is supposedly a “sanctuary city”, but if a person is arrested for certain crimes, they’ll be deported. These crimes include driving while intoxicated, domestic violence, and child abuse. While these sound like terrible things, the crime may be as small as spanking a child as Tania has witnessed. A person can be deported simply for being arrested; they don’t have to be convicted or found guilty. Queens Neighborhoods United wants new ideas for dealing with policing as their communities have been criminalized and members have been sent to jail or deported for minimal crimes. Marijuana possession is another example – a person can go to jail for 20 years. 00:31:20 Tania became an activist for a few reasons. One is her immigration status. Tania came to the U.S. on a VISA, but she was undocumented for a long time. She understands the struggle and depression that people go through if they can’t find work or fear for their lives when interacting with the police. Tania had a prior deportation order and if she had been arrested during that time, she would have been immediately deported without seeing a judge. Tania grew up surrounded by poverty. She was fortunate in that her father belonged to a union, 32BJ SEIU (Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ). Her family was not middle class, but they were better off than some. They had health insurance and a car which were luxuries for some people in their community. Her mother worked as a street vendor to earn money. Tania has seen how the police treat community members and she feels they deserve better. Tania used to fight for herself and her family, but now she wants to give back to the community due to the poverty and suffering she witnessed around her. 00:33:41 Queens community groups differ from those in other boroughs because there are people from so many different countries. It’s not always easy to organize into sectors by country – sometimes it’s easier to organize by continents! It’s necessary to translate materials into many languages. Queens Neighborhoods United worked with other organization including DRUM to create a “Hate Free Zone”. After the election of President Trump, there were a lot of hate crimes in the community. For the “Hate Free Zone”, they put on events, visited small businesses, and made presentations on how to intervene if someone is being attacked in the community. In Queens, it’s necessary to organize through different languages, gender identities, and political agendas. A lot of work needs to be done in Queens. Issues include changing the District Attorney, Richard Brown, who is very conservative. Congressperson Joseph Crowley and his attorneys control the city and foreclosures and make millions of dollars. Queens United Neighborhoods does not accept grants from donations from politicians or foundations, so they are not beholden to anyone who might be harming the community. Queens Neighborhoods United fundraises in the community. Tania feels that Queens Neighborhoods United needs to continue working on collaborating with other Queens organizations, especially those representing other areas of Queens. 00:37:30 Tania and her husband now live on 81st St. between 37th and Roosevelt Ave. She and her husband are renters, and she loves their building which is made up of half-renters and half Co-op. People in her building are from all over the world and many languages are spoken. They celebrate many different holidays, such as those in the South Asian and Sikh communities. Tania loves the area they live in. She likes to travel around NYC while her husband prefers to stay in a 3 block radius from home. There are many diverse cuisines to be found within 2 or 3 blocks of their apartment. There are always parades on 37th St. The only problem is parking. She feels very safe walking around the area even late at night as there are always people around. Tania feels she has a unique perspective on the streets because her volunteer job is to talk to street vendors and community members about what’s going on. Her organization has a great relationship with the vendors, and she gets a lot of free food! 00:41:10 Tania has a long commute to work. She takes the 7 train to the 2/3 train to Wall St. 00:41:23 Tania hopes that people who want to stay in her community will do so and will be able to stay via tenant protections and true affordable housing. The median income for her neighborhood is $40,000. Rents are going up and people often have to spend more than 50% of their income. Tania also hopes the Queens will continue to be a launching pad for immigrants from all over the world where they can live in a comfortable space and speak their native language. She hopes they can find their community and then acclimate to NYC and the United States. Tania feels more like a New Yorker than an American. She feels at home in her community and she loves seeing teenagers out on the street, creating things. She hopes that music and clothing will still be created in Jackson Heights. She also hopes that immigrant women will continue to be able to make a living and sustain their families without being criminalized. 00:44:33 Tania and Queens Neighborhoods United have been talking to new leaders following the elections and sharing ideas for new initiatives and proposed changes to laws. These include proposing a Community Land Trust that would allow people to own land for 100 years and help with rent control. Other ideas include an incubator for immigrant woman who are street vendors or would like to become business owners or are in need of other resources. Tania hopes that Queens continues to be the borough that welcomes diverse communities and that people find a home here. The opposite of the way that Tania sees Queens is a transient town with no sense of community or building. 00:46:44 Tania hopes that the work done by her, community members, and small businesses will be a drop in the bucket to the way Queens is in 10 years. Whatever happens to Queens, if it becomes a tech hub, they won’t go down without a fight. There is people power in Queens, and residents are willing to fight for their communities. ",
  "Mavilia_Anthony_timecode.txt": "Salman: Hi this is Salman Alqahtani I am meeting today Anthony Mavilia on October 19, 2018, at the Long Island city art center in his painting studio let's start talking about family. Anthony Mavilia: My family came to the United States from Italy, my father came to the United States in 1932 but my grandfather proceeded him in I believe 1914 or 1915, my grandfather fought ww1, and went back and forth like many immigrants went back and forth to Italy to United State back and forth finally in 1932 the whole family left Italy, and they all came to the United States, and this is pretty big extended family because my father had 2 sisters and they all have children so too big family that's lived in United States. Salman: Can you say the date again. 00:30:86 Anthony Mavilia: 1932 my father came to the United States, my grandfather came here I think in 1914 or 1915 and he went back and forth to Italy and Unite State until he finally immigrated here and became a United States citizen the reason I bring that up is because I was born in what's considered the little Italy section of The Bronx there's a section in Brooks was born everybody's Italian everybody speaks Italian restaurants Italian the food is Italian it's Italian ghetto so 1960 we moved to queens that's where I start living in Queens in 1960 when I moved to Queens first I lived in Queen's village Queens's village is was a small section of queens very suburban arena it almost like a little town it was like a small towns little houses small stores. Salman: That was your 1st home in queens? 02:44:56 Anthony Mavilia: yeah, that was my1st home in Queens and so I was 8 years old so we lived there until I was 18 so I considered that I grew up in queens village I went to school there I went to the public school I went to Catholic school I went to both types of schools Amm.. it was a nice place to grow up it was very nice there were a lot of kids you now we play a lot of games boys all hung out you know we ride bicycles this very nice kind of childhood, but the neighborhood there is an aspect of races in queens and in Queens village that is important in 19 let's see we left in 1960 Amm� 70 by 1970 the neighborhood began to change rational, and the neighborhood began to change black people began to move in, and white people fled Salman: That was in 19�? 3:49:45 Anthony Mavilia: About 1970 it began mostly 1860 moved in 1970 we left we moved and it the banks were doing a program of breaking the neighborhood up they were giving mortgages only to black people or only to white people in certain areas if they wanted to keep the area white they give the mortgages to white people they wanted to make the area black they give mortgages to the black people and there was a real racial you know tension in the area that was also when the schools will beings integrated and they were putting black-and-white kids in high schools together and it's creating huge amount of problems at the time so in 1970 my parents moved to Bellerose which is another part of queens were very close to national county all white Hhh� All white ok so Amm� and it's interesting because that neighborhood today in Bellerose is all Indian it's almost everybody in there is India or Pakistani in that section of Bellerose and it was interesting to watch the change in the neighborhood, it didn't create problems but it just was a change, in other words, it didn't create the problems that black-and-white integration provided but it just was a change in the neighborhood the shops then the food store moved from being like American to being Indian and they moved the many the restaurants change from you know whatever like American food hamburgers and stuff like that to being Indian food and the residence in fact when my parents passed away when my father passed away we sold his house and we solid to Indian people so the neighborhood now it has been a lot of changes in terms of the population. Salman: How was your feeling when did your fist moving? 05:46:42 Anthony Mavilia: Aww... we missed it so bad yeah because the house I grew up in, and it was a big house and moved from a big house to a small house, so I felt like you know all we came down you know cause inside this good Am... so that was yeah we missed it and also our friends that we had in the area you know we didn't see them that much anymore it was hard to keep in touch so we missed queens village, queens village was a very nice you know Queens village is an old neighborhood and some of the houses where from the turn of this century� 6:22 there had been farms their some of the houses were in the farm because Queens village you know all of Queens was farming was all farming. Salman: was it in 1970? 06:37:05 Anthony Mavilia: No no no in the late 1900s and only 1900s and the reason I bring it up is our neighbors their house was the original farm house that and they have owned all the land since the late 1900s their family owned the land and then farming just they stopped farming and sold the land and as they sold the land houses were built on it and street were put in and it became a different kind of neighborhood there where as Bellerose was all planed in other words we moved to Bellerose all the houses were the same everywhere all the houses were the exact same house every single house was the same but in Queens village every house was different because they all built at different times and it was also more economy integrated neighborhood because in Queens village they were very big houses that wealthy people lived in and then right up the street there will be very small house that not so wealthy people had a mix people with different economic groups but in Bellerose all were the same, and all the people were the same more or less made the same amount of money they all more or less had the same kind of careers it was all very you know very similar so the was big different between queens' village and Bellerose so Amm� and I liked Queens' village. Salman: Alright. 08:15 Anthony Mavilia: So professionally I became a teacher, and I taught children with emotional and learning problems, and I was a teacher at the Norman Tomas high school in Manhattan even though I probably have lived In queens and I taught in Manhattan, and I taught that school for 32 years Amm and good career I enjoyed it I like this teaching Amm� and I left when they close the school you know New Your city has a policy of breaking up big high schools New York city has a lot of very large high schools with 1000, 2000 students and a power school was really big school, and it was broken up in 2010 0r 11. Salman: That was elementary school? 09:15 Anthony Mavilia: No, it was a high school, so I taught high school, I taught art I taught computer graphix, and I also taught history also my subject that I taught. The New York high schools have been separating the big schools into small specialized schools so that what happened so when that happened I just retired I have been teaching for 32 years, so I retired, and I have been to the studio and painting expiating and that's I do. Salman: So, you feel comfortable when you paint. 09:55 Anthony Mavilia: Aw yeah, you know I joined this studio in 1991 and I was a member and in 2007 I think in 2007 up until from 1967 to 2007 this a group studio on 14th street and in Manhattan and we were in a small Bronx town and it was at that time grand village was the center of the art world for New York City there were artists in our building there artist everywhere by the time we left rent became so high that could not afford it to stay on 14 Street so in 14 Street our rent went up to 4600$ per month for a housing space ok so couldn't afford to be there I will talk more about what we are so 2007 we began to look for new studio, and the old director was ready to leave she was getting older, so I volunteered to step in and help find a space and we came to so this building this building now is full of artist it's like what's 14 Street used to be so you know there are artist set all over this building and. Salman: Yeah, I see. 11:24 Anthony Mavilia: Yeah, if you look, it's hard to see it because they all have their doors closed you do not see it but every year they have all open studios every year in May all the artist in the area open their studios to public, so anybody can walk in and look and talk Salman: Everybody every in May? 11:45 Anthony Mavilia: In May yeah one weekend in May Saturday and Monday when they open up their the studio there are maybe 15 or 20 buildings in here that are full of artist this an artist neighborhood their just tons of artist Hhhhh here so trying tell you what I need to tell you about us we become a queens' group better way we used to in Manhattan based group and initially when I started I think I was the only person from Queens who came into Manhattan to use the studio now the studio was in Queens I think we only have 3 maybe 4 3 or 4 come from Manhattan to come to Queens because you know people from Manhattan hate coming to Queens they don't like it it's like it's crazy you probably know cause people from Manhattan Aw you came from New Jersey Aw my Gad , so we are growing you know this group we finally reached 10 it took us a while to get to 10 people and we have artist who are traditional realist we have artist who are conceptual artist we have artist who are apstract so we have like wide variety artists in the studio and the reason I bring it up is we receive money from the community trust to keep the studio going and we have a man-day to help develop artist in other words to help artist to develop their themselves artist that what we do and that's why we are a group a specific group and the reason we call the appended square painters is that started in Grantage village in apping in square so where ever we've moved we 've always kept the same name so that's why we have that name it's not a person it was a place. Salman: Do you remember the date? 14:04 Anthony Mavilia: 1947 and in 196? I do not know I was little kid we cooperated we became we are actually at painting square painters INC cooperated and we are in profit we raise you know we raise funds we do funding you know we do outreach to get money for the group and for the studio and we kind of unique there not that many groups like do that artist who get selected to use studio they pay very little it's very unexpansive because studio spaces expansive artist pay a hundred fifty dollars a month to use the space, so we are very inexpensive. Salman: what kind of pant do you do? 15:25 Anthony Mavilia: I use natural elements like tree and rocks, but I try to create a now a land scape a new idea something that is different from Just a land scape. Ohh Vitoria she is another member hey how are doing I am being interviewed this gentleman is interviewing me this is Salman Vitoria Salman Salman Vitoria, he asked the question that I hate to describe your art what you do you know I hate that yeah he is art he is art ok remember when I said we have conceptual Vitoria is like a conceptual artist. 16:20 Victoria: he just makes you it's not everybody I mean who makes art that has to start from a consult and that you develop, I am a mix of media he uses photography 16:37 Anthony Mavilia: I just yeah and I am a just straight painter. 16:42 Victoria: He starts from the journey which makes a difference. Salman: thank you for your cooptation. 17:12 Anthony Mavilia: you I have had hoped that when you interview me that I would get many of our artist to be interviewed at the same time but that's ok. Salman: In the time you were in school, did you enjoy school? 17:28 Anthony Mavilia: Oh god, I hated my high school it was a Catholic high school it was run by brothers, brothers who very strict the brothers were evil. Salman: Can you get closer. 17:52 Anthony Mavilia: I will say this I got a good education, but it just not a good place to go to school. Salman: ok 18:03 Anthony Mavilia: You know kids fought with each other a lot it was all boys the boys were always fighting with each other the bully each other a lot the brothers were into like a competition between the students. Salman: all these situations happen in different schools. 18:20 Anthony Mavilia: yeah I guess, so that's true that's true, Yeah I know I was not unique. Salman: Are you still friend with the old friend? 18:34 Anthony Mavilia: only one person from high school only one person that I still know that's it and fact I only became friend with him in college we met when we started talking we found out that we came from the same high school, but I did not know him because he is younger than me, so I did not know him. Salman: let's talk about Queens, your memories in Queens in general? 19:04 Anthony Mavilia: ok, I was wished I lived in Manhattan Hhhhh. Ok, so I am not like huge of Queen's punster, but queens is a good affordable place for the middle-class person to live. Salman: ok good. 19:29 Anthony Mavilia: in other words, there is a variety of houses, there is a variety of living situations. One thing that I have learned over time that I did not know that there are a lot of cultural opportunities, in other words, if you wanna go to was Indian restaurant, you go the (wichmenhelps), if you wanna go to Greek restaurant, you going to go to (Historian). If you wanna go to A liklakn resultant, you gotta go to Corona, so that there is a lot of different you know ethnic groups in Queen's which you do not see in only Manhattan, so that's one thing it's an advantage a good thing about queens. Queens is developing a lot now, in fact it's over developing in my opinion if you work in around this street here every single street there is construction going on and but their not bringing Subways they are not bringing restaurants they are not I don't see a lot of stores opening so you have 100 of businesses 1000s of people coming in and there is no infrastructure for them there is nothing for them to how they didn't serve these people, so I do not really understand, I seems to me that there is a that they developing it, and they are not looking after the people who are coming here live now, and I see that in to Gardens when I was living in to Kew gardens. Kew gardens forest hills in Kew gardens are historical neighborhood in forest Gardens you are not allowed to paint your home any colour you want, you must keep the structure of the house it's historical are Kew gardens has a similar history that was not protected and people now destroying all the houses. Salman: What date was that? 21:32 Anthony Mavilia: Forest Gardens just celebrated its 100th anniversary, so 1918 or between 1912 and 1918. Forest hills gardens were planned, and creative and forest hills gardens is a unique community it something that called a the what they called it (Gardens City Movement) there is a movement in the United States to incorporate trees gardens natural elements in the landscape so that if go to part of Manhattan building building building building concrete no trees no parks just straight. The Kew gardens city movement was designed to create a more natural and healthier a living situation for the people so if you go forest gardens you the streets occurred there is a variety of houses they have gardens in front trees on streets it looks like an English village that how it's designed and it does I mean there are churches from middle ages, and it's very pretty Kew gardens which tight next to it took some of the same ideas, but it was never as well planned as forest hill gardens, so now people are moving I Kew gardens and just destroying their houses they are look for 2 reasons the houses were small they knocking them down and make a huge houses, what they putting up multi like small apartment buildings like 7 or 6 stores of apartment buildings so for example, in my neighborhood 116 St two beautiful houses were torn down, and huge ugly high rises were put in place, so we are missing all of Queens now this offer development. They are destroying history, and they are creating a design that the part of it when I am getting subway when I am getting the buses when I am getting any of the infrastructures. Salman: You mentioned that some people are not allowed to paint their houses, what was the reason? 23:57 Anthony Mavilia: you have to use certain colors in other words in the historical neighborhood they control of it they have they have determined what the historical color are. For those homes and you only allowed to use them I don't know what the penalty is but most people understand that if they maintain the historical Integrity of the house that the value of the house would be maintained worth money you know. If you take your house and you painted pink no one is going to buy it you know what I mean. You know another word it's understood that Play historical nature of that community draws people to buy it. In fact, I live in that cooperative develop development they are floor buildings where I live right now, and our building was being built in 1937, so it's pretty old for New York, Queens, in style is it called Reggiean style Which is an English Style. We have done a restoration all of the buildings taken into history and other words to make historical registration to make it look the exact way the first time opened. You know we proud of that.

Salman: Did you serve in the in the military? 31:34 Anthony Mavilia: no, I was lucky I was very lucky in the last year I think the last year the draft the war in Vietnam men with drafted going to the Army I'm buying 1972 or 73 the world was wide in down, so they still do the draft I got a very high number, so they didn't get to my number, so I was very lucky. I was super worried about that. Salman: so, let's go back to the history of life and the bad and Good Times. It's a start with the good first. 32:29 Anthony Mavilia: actually, I'm I feel like I am a lucky person. I have not had a bad time. I you know not the wood. You know and Tim's of the most recently the hurricane what was that hurricane the one that did so much damage in Queens. Jon can you help me out what was that hurricane did so much damage in Queens, Sandy, Sandy. It passed where I lived it didn't hit us. It hit the park around where I live in is in the middle of first Park so the house is completely in the corner of this huge Park not down and all the park, so we were protected, you know so many places in Queens were hurt very very very badly flooding trees down electricity what I left just like nothing happened so I guess I live in ok life . I try to think about a natural disasters you know you know the 9/11 you know construction of the World Trade Center in that time I lived in Queens, but I also own an apartment in Manhattan, and the apartment was in 28th Street, so I used to see the World Trade Center from my window and when it's destroyed you know saddest thing I remember was the Armory of V Street between its place called an Armory. When the town came down, People thought that many people were missing. And people put up photographs of missing people of the people they thought they are missing. That the saddest thing when I see all of these photographs. It still makes me you know people, I you know very hard to talk about it, and you know living in Queens days after the event, I remember being in the restaurant with friends, and people were still tens we were in the restaurant and the waiter dropped a hole plate by accident and people the whole restaurant huuuuuu , and you can tell that people still tense people realized and continued talking with each other it was interesting how that, the you know It took months to get rid of the smoke you know the smoke, and smoke with shift you know come to the winds when the wind. And I couldn't use the apartment, and I have to go back to Queens, so I couldn't stay in that apartment because it was we didn't know it was cancer also smelled horrible. Salman: so, the smell and Ash did it reach to Queens? 36:44 Anthony Mavilia: it reached Brooklyn but I didn't know if it's rich I mean I didn't experience it in Queens and smelled it in Queens. But definitely reached to Brooklyn. So I don't think it's reached to Queens. So that I probably say the most event that I remember my life in terms of long-term you know what's the war in Vietnam when the American soldiers fighting with Vietnam and that when you reached 18 or 19 and divorce still going on you could be drafted and so there were a lot of people who thought in my age thought okay I have to go to Canada you know what I mean, or I'm going to go to get out of this country And get out of United States I don't know anybody left the United States. Salman: did you know somebody go to the war? 38:05 Anthony Mavilia: that's interesting none of my friends got drafted. A friend that I became friends with recently last year, he was drafted to the Army it was interesting but because he knows about music and producing they didn't send them to Vietnam and he did music production for the Army to put on shows for the soldiers. He stayed in New York area in the South I think, and he put on shows. And another friend of mine was drafted, and because had taken, you know people who, when he was drafted to the army because he had that skill instead of sending him to Vietnam to work doing the drafting. Salman: tell me about 2008 when the financial disaster? 40:04 Anthony Mavilia: A didn't affect me very much, I was very lucky, because I worked for New York City and I thought high school for New York New York City tell if I had to me there some of my stocks and West value I have money on stock market and the stocks lost value because I didn't sell them, in 2008 did not affect me and I think it was because of my age and I was in my career, if I am younger or walking in a company I think I would be affected. 2008 created the situation that we are living now today when you know where the president like Trump you know somebody like that I don't want to get started. Salman: so, let's get back to where we lived before? 41:28 Anthony Mavilia: So I can talk about Kew Gardens I am pretty active and Kew Gardens and in two ways one is that I hoped to women in Kew Gardens we have a pottery store it's a woman who teaches people how to make a pottery you know how to used the well and to throw the pat and she has a school to do that and I coordinated with her and another person to make an art Fair called to (Kew Gardens community Art Fair) and we look for artists in the area who they have to come from Queens artist from Queens that was October 1st this year 2018 we had 37 artist and not only artist but also cross people who do jewelry who make pottery also after and also musicians and activities for kids like for kids to draw and paint and recovered about 10 blocks 10 city blocks you know people want to participate. So that's a pretty a big event cuz Kew Gardens is a small neighborhood so that was a big event and I was part of. And that started because where I live there are four buildings and complex and we have a big Garden in between 4 buildings so one year you know I told you we couldn't run the studio to bring art to the public so let me bring us to where I live that will be easy so there are people in my complex they are artists There are women who blows glass there are many people who make pottery there are people who draw pictures and people who take photographs in my neighbors so we make like a little art fair in the area and people sold to each other and it was nice, and it helped to bring the community together somebody feel like you know we know our neighbors, so I was part of that. Salman: how do you see the art industry developments from the old days and now? 44:18 Anthony Mavilia: Okay it is become much more intense right now the art it's bigger there are more artists than there have been in all town and Technology people use computers, people, using computer design people using new technology to create artworks, so you know people using video people using multimedia to create artworks different media, so the art word which had been It is the artwork which has been you know on campus now-now using computers using Sounds new materials you know it is developed Salman: what artist use used it to use tools or something old in the old days? 45:19 Anthony Mavilia: I mean I just use pretty much the same tools for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years brushes canvas wood, but it's the way that they use them that's different each year of Art an image that they make are different offer each year and trying to think if you look over they see that paint over there that's behind. do you see the face that guy, okay you can look at that that's very realistic versus now she's developing that image right now but in the past was more about representing reality so when I look at you and your picture now artist more about what's going on in my head probably because you know phone is if I want to picture you the phone is going to do it better job than me you know what I mean So now if I like to paint if I want to paint can I what can I do as a painter how can I express ideas you know the ideas art is communication the imagery in other words, so painting is communication via Colors by texture all that kind of stuff when I communicate with you I will have to be realistic in other words to the camera or make it realistic very well Salman: you are right. 47:18 Anthony Mavilia: now what other things can I do to communicate ideas so that's where artist I think more today than it was in the past, in the past artists where a lot of artists still are very proud of the fact that they can portray this cop beautifully I'm going to paint that cup perfect okay, other artists say that let's take a picture. Salman: what other things that you missed from the Arts tools from the old days? 47:51 Anthony Mavilia: I just know I did not miss it anything of them. Each period In history create art that Fills the needs of the people who left that so in the 17th century Feeble wanted it very realistic in other words they wanted that called a bowl Graves they wanted butterfly very perfectly because they had no cameras, but in the 20 Century or 19th century when camera was invented The question for artist became the camera does a better job than me, so now what is the artist going to do so then the Artist said well the way it feels to be alive so I am gonna get the feeling of this feeling. Salman: that's it thanks you for your time. 48:50 Anthony Mavilia: thank you for coming. ",
  "McAndrew_Maria_timecode.txt": "Maria Daphnia has spent a good part of her childhood in Sunny Side, Queens. Her family moved to Sunny Side Gardens when she was 9 years old and has resided there for a long time; She had a lot of relatives living close by, so it was a pleasing and benign place for her to grow up in. As a child, she attended the Queen of Angel church with her sister and spent most of her time socializing there. After getting married, at the age of 20; she moved out of her family home in Sunny Side Gardens, Nonetheless, she stayed linked to the area because of having extended and immediate family members still, living there. Despite living in Queens, she attended Hunter High School from 6th to 12th grade, which was in Manhattan. Therefore, she had to take the subway when she was just 11 years old. During this interview, Maria talks about what it was like growing up in Sunny Side Gardens during the 50’s, attending Queen Of Angel church, and shares memories of taking the subway during that time period. 00:00:17 the family moved to the house in Sunny Side Gardens, when she was 9 years old. Maria lived there until she was 20 and got married. A significant part of her childhood was in Sunny Side, so she thinks of it, as home; her parents lived there for many years; so, she still stayed connected to the neighborhood. 00:01:00 lived at the house probably, from 51 to 62. 00:01:19 in retrospect, Sunny Side seems like a nirvana, it was a wonderful place; you knew your neighbors. It was also a close knit community. She lived in 44th and Skillman; her grandparents owned a home in 46th and Skillman, an aunt in 43rd street, and an uncle in 48th street. So, she could not go very far, without running into someone from her family. Thus, she thought of it, as a safe place to grow up. 00:02:15 most of her memories revolves around her family. Her father was the 5th child of an Italian American couple and there were a total of 9 children. Both of her parents grew up in the lower east of Manhattan. When her grandfather from her father side, retired from his job at the telephone company; all the children put in 100 dollar a piece for a down payment for the house in Sunny Side. That house became the focus for the family. It was a two family house; her grandparents and one of her unmarried aunt at that time, lived there. The basement had a full kitchen and they would gather there during big holidays, like New Year’s, Easter, Mother’s Day and Father’s Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. It was like a revolving door because all of the children would constantly be there and the kitchen would never be full. It was a happy place for her to grow up in. 00:04:29 the family would get together during holidays. Christmas was a big feast; they would start eating around 1:00 o’ clock in the afternoon and keep on eating until 9:00 o’ clock. One of the uncles would dress up as Santa Claus and come down the basement, with the bells ringing, the little children’s would sit on his lap, and they would get presents. She also had a grandmother, who lived with her. The grandmother contributed the down payment for the house Maria and her parents lived in; it had 3 bedrooms. Her grandmother had one, her parents had one, and her sister and she had one. The house only had one bathroom. 00:05:47 attended P.s 150 from 5th to 6th grade; a lot of the kids went to 125, but she was accepted into Hunter High School, which was an all girls’ school, at that time. Therefore, she attended Hunter High School from 6th to 12th grade and took the subway every day. 00:06:12 it was a good school. Sonia Madaour graduated from Hunter High School. 00:06:47 after getting married, her parents moved to the Queens Bridge Houses in Long Island City. Recently, she heard that it is the largest housing project in the country. It was like a haven for people, who lived in tenement during early 40’s; it was a stepping stone for people, to save up money and find a better place. Her family lived there until they bought the house in Sunny Side because her grandparents lived there. Sunny Side Gardens was designed by Louise Lanford and it was the first planned community in the country; they are brick attached homes and they built around a central courtyard, so they have small yards. It was a huge step, for people like her parents, to own a home. It is the only house, her mother has lived in and it was important to her. 00:09:11 they would gather at grandmother house, for every single holidays. She had a lot of cousins and they were around her age. One of her cousin shared a name with her. In Italian families, the children are often named after their grandparents; her grandmother was named Maria and her grandfather was named Paul. Therefore, many of her male cousins were named Paul. Her grandfather was illiterate, even in Italian; he grew up in a poor part of Sicily, came to America and met her grandmother, who was also Sicilian. Family was really important to them and their social life revolved around the family and they did not have a large group of friends. 00:10:45 they would go to church because they are catholic. She mostly remembers, eating a lot during the holidays, because it was a big thing. The would eat pasta, roast, and veggies during holidays. The men would eat artichoke and wine, while the women would clean up. 00:11:41 her grandparents and her parents were not church goers. However, her sister and she were sent out to attend church. Therefore, her sister and she were very connected to the church. The only time she saw her grandfather attending church, was because he was going to have a surgery for prostate cancer. The church was particular important to her, because she did not go to the local high school so she lost touch with the kids she met in P.s 150. She was taking the train to get to Lexington Avenue and 68th street, when she was 11. Therefore, she did not have the social life that most kids did when attending the local high school. The Queen of Angel church would hold an afernaity on Tuesday; if you went there and you listened to half an hour of religious instructions; you got to dance, so there were records and there was an old refrigerator wit sodas, and that was her social life. That’s, where she met the kids from the neighborhood. The Church was called “The Queen of Angel” and it was directly across from her house; she also met her husband there. 00:15:01 the church is important to her, she is still a church goer. She met her husband there, got engaged and married at the church, and her first child was baptized at the church as well. The church was also different back then. It was glue for the community. Sunny Side was mostly Irish, Italian, and Jews during that time. The church in the 50 had a more prominent role in the community in comparison to today’s time. 00:16:37 Became friends with people from the church and they would have parties at the basements of their house. Toni Cad arouse, in particular, had a lot of parties during Friday nights; in his basement. They would also gather at Tour be park in 43 streets; someone would bring a portable radio during summer nights and they would hang out. 00:17:42 would listen to music such as; Rock N, Roll, Elvis, the Fathers, Coasters, American Band Stand 00:19:03 started taking the subway, when she was 11 years old, because she was enrolled in Hunter High school going into 6th grade. She had the original helicopter mom, who was very protective, so to let her 11 year old girl take the subway, was not easy for her. The summer before; her mother, sister, and she, would go back and forth, from the street of sunny side to the school; so she would know and not get lost. However, she ended up getting lost anyway. She had one bad experience in the subway. She had a lot of friends in flushing, so they would take the subway together. Generally, the subway was pretty safe in the 50’s, but , a guy was following her and her friends, when they were changing trains. She never told her mother regarding it; she started taking the bus from then on because she was afraid to take the train. Unfortunately, she late to due to taking the bus, so she ended up taking the subway again. For her, the subway is a convenient way to get from place to place. 00:22:17 there were little stores in Skillen Avenue during that time. There was a laundromat that was run by a Chinese family, between 45th to 46th; they were all stores, and a grocery and butcher store at the corner; they had to share the corner. The grocery store was called “ Charlies Market”, named after the owner, Charlie Morena. 00:25:30 her little neighborhood, in Sunny Side Garden, looks exactly as it did. Her parents lived at the house for 50 years. The house also had 2 apartments upstairs, and they would rent it out. Therefore, the house paid for itself. The subway did not change as much over the years, other than having AC’s rather than ceiling fans. ",

  "McDonald_Gertrude_timecode.txt": "Looking forward to her 95th birthday in August, 2011, Gertrude McDonald shares some memories from a lifetime of activity in Sunnyside, Queens. She moved as a little girl in 1923 to one of the first large apartment buildings in the area and played with her friends in the empty fields surrounding the building. They had steam heat, unlike the cold water flats prevalent in Manhattan and Brooklyn at the time, so it felt like a real move up to live in the developing neighborhood. Her father was a member of the electrician�s union and struggled to find work during the Great Depression. The family moved in for a time with her uncle in Corona, Queens, but quickly moved back to Sunnyside when the economy turned around.

Interview [00:00:06] AB Okay, so this is Abby Banks, and I'm here with - is it Father McGuirl? MM Monsignor McGuirl, actually. AB Monsignor McGuirl. MM Right. AB And we're gonna talk about Forest Hills and the QueensWay Project, and hopefully about your life. [cough] Sorry. Um, So have you lived in Forest Hills your entire life? [00:00:38] MM I was born and raised three blocks from where we're sitting. I was born November 19, 1945, and of course, like most people, in a hospital. St. Claire's Hospital in Manhattan, which no longer exists but my mom and dad lived here in Forest Hills on Manse Street. And my grandparents had bought the house we were living in 1925 when this area was just turning from farm land into housing projects. Um, so it kind of came as a surprise when our Bishop, Bishop DiMarzio asked me to come back here. I never expected I'd be back in Forest Hills after ordination -- I've been ordained 42 years. But I was raised here, in this parish, was baptized here in Our Lady of Mercy, received first communion here, said my first Mass here, so my roots are in Forest Hills, yeah. [00:01:25] AB So, um, as far as -- you said that you came back here, but-- MM Well after ordination, I was assigned -- spent a good number of my life, uh, this is the Brooklyn Diocese here, and that means Brooklyn and Queens County, if you were a Diocesan priest, you would not be -- you would be ordained for that particular area. My first assignment was in Jackson Heights, Blessed Sacrament Church, uh, and I was there for six years. And then much to my surprise, the Bishop at that time, Francis Mugavero, asked me to be Vocation Director and that means the one who goes out and beats drum for-- to raise consciousness about vocations to both priesthood and religious life, and I did that for five years. Then I was administrator of Most Holy Trinity Parish in Brooklyn, the Williamsburg section, for a year and a half, I was a transitional pastor. The Franciscan friars were going to take the church over but they needed somebody between to kind of modulate the change. And while living in Brooklyn before getting to -- I lived at St. Vincent DePaul's Parish, which no longer exists unfortunately -- it was the parish my father was actually baptized in in 1903, before they came out here. And um when I left Holy Trinity, I was in St. Mel's Parish in Flushing for about 11 years, then St. Joan of Arc in Jackson Heights for another twelve, and then back here. [chuckles] [00:02:57] AB So, you've stayed in New York City the whole time--? MM I have virtually -- not only in New York City, except for those six years living in Brooklyn in St. Vincent DePaul's, and the year and half at Most Holy Trinity, I have been assigned in Queens County. Now I had nothing to do with that, that was whatever the authorities, whatever reasons they had for keeping me in Queens. Even the section of Brooklyn that I lived in, which was the area that my father came from, is so close to Queens they're like the communities just beyond the border. For instance, when I was living at St. Vincent's, I almost considered myself living in Queens, in Western Queens, because the area would be very much like Long Island City is now. [00:03:41] I've never really gotten -- some parts of Brooklyn are kind of like foreign territory to me, I really don't know much about them. Northern end of Brooklyn, yes -- Bed-Stuy, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, but lower than that, we start to enter into different territory. Years back, you weren't necessarily -- when there were more priests, the vocation rate was higher, the chances of you returning to the parish you were raised in were very remote, so that's what I meant when I was kind of surprised to be sent back here. I believe I'm the sixth pastor of this parish, actually. AB So can you tell me a little bit about the history of Our Lady of Mercy? [00:04:28] MM Yes. This parish was founded in 1930 as a free-standing parish of its own. Before that for several years, it had been a chapel of ease for the mother parish of the area, which is Our Lady Queen of Martyrs on Ascan Ave and Queens Boulevard. It was the first church -- Catholic Church -- in Forest Hills. When the population began to boom, I believe Queen of Martyrs was founded around 1917, and at that time, really, the only thing out here was some Cord-Meyer houses on the Northside of Queens Blvd. and Forest Hills Gardens, which was in development at that point. When this area down here started to boom, in the early - early to mid-1920s, which was when my own house was built -- [coughs] excuse me -- there was seen the need for another chapel, so what would happen. The chapel was at the end of this block, where there's a private home now, and a priest would come down on Sundays from Our Lady Queen of Martyrs to say Mass there so people down this way did not have to trudge all the way up to Queen of Martyrs. When things even got more crowded, when the chapel was no longer large enough to accommodate people, um, the movie theater -- now known as the Cinemart, but when I was growing up, called the Inwood, still there, but now it's broken up into many smaller, as many of them are, smaller theaters, um, they used that also for Mass on Sunday occasionally. So in 1930, it was created as its own parish. [00:06:06] My grandparents and father's family had been here since before it was a parish, so really originally they were parishioners of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, where I went to grade school actually, after two years at PS 144, next block. There was no school here then. The first pastor was Father Edward Costello. He built the church and this building, the rectory. He never really lived in the rectory though. He died before its completion. And then he was followed by Father Christopher Molloy, who was the pastor when I was a boy. He in turn was followed by Father -- Monsignor Matthew Hickey, who built the school, and then Father Jack Johnston, Monsignor Jack Johnston1, Monsignor Gerald Langelier , and then you-know-who. [laughs] [00:06:55] So the parish has been -- it's not as large as Queen of Martyrs, because we don't have all those apartment houses. If you would take something like Parker's Towers on Yellowstone Blvd, if that were filled with Catholics -- it's not, but if it were -- that would be as large as this whole parish, probably, because it's such a large, those buildings are so large. This parish pretty much consists of private dwellings, some of them two-families, but most of them single. There are a few small apartment houses not too many. And the population when I was growing up was predominantly German, of German ancestry, people who had moved out from areas to our west, from Ridgewood and Glendale, Bushwick, um, and settled here in the country. And our name, McGuirl, was an exception on our block. Names like Kaiser, and Schmidt and Witt, and Mueller, and you know, Schreiner, and names like that were the most common. In the late 1950s into the early 60s, the neighborhood saw a bit of a demographic shift as many Italo-Americans began to move from those same areas, Bushwick and Ridgewood, out this way also. I would say right now, in this parish, Italian last names would be dominant but no longer the majority, because to the general mix has been added a good number of Filipino families, other Asian families, some Hispanic families, even some newer Irish families, and others and Polish families. So it's become a real mix, much more than it was when I was growing up, where it was almost entirely people of European background, and it's not any more. But I do think that makes it better actually, it's a little bit more diverse. [00:08:52] The parish has the usual array of activities, you know in terms of we try to keep a community. I am a firm believer that you don't have parish unless you 1 Msgr. Jack Jonhston and Father Jack Johnston are the same person but he received the honorific \"Monsignor\" later in his life. �John� was his formal first name though he was often known by the nickname \"Jack.\" AB Oh no no, it's fine. Can you tell me, like, what the borders actually are for the parishes? [00:09:46] MM Yes, I'll tell you what they are, but they don't count any more. AB Okay. MM Technically, are you familiar with the street grid here? AB A little bit. MM Alright, the streets on this side of Queens Blvd., and once on the other side also, but we've maintained the named streets on this side, the others on the other side for whatever reasons became numbered streets. They begin with Austin, Burns, Clyde, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fleet, uh, Groton, Ingram, Harrow, uh, and those streets -- from Groton Street to actually Myrtle Avenue, but the other end of the parish contains Forest Park. So I probably have more raccoons, wild animals, horses because there's several riding academies down here, so that area doesn't really count in a sense. So really, it's from Woodhaven [Boulevard], from Union Turnpike in the south, to Groton Street in the north, and then it's a jagged line, it's hard to say, but sort of generally, Alderton street, over to west, to again Union Turnpike which kind of sweeps around the parish. However, as has become common in very very many Catholic communities throughout the country, people go where they want to go. They either like liturgy, or they like the music or the personalities of the priests or deacons involved, or there's a school and their parish doesn't have -- a whole array of means. While the formal boundary to the north is Groton, but we have a good number of people coming from streets that would probably be Our Lady Queen of Martyrs and in turn, they may have people from down here that go there regularly. So there's a real interchange between the two parishes actually, so, uh, because I'll hear from people when we have devotions in honor of the Blessed Mother after the 9:00. After the 8:30 this morning, excuse me, two people present were talking about getting new booklets and they go to Queen of Martyrs sometimes, and they come here, and that's very very common, so you know. So the boundaries are those, but they don't mean all that much anymore. We have people coming as far as from Jewel Avenue and 164th Street in Flushing, so I mean there's, that's quite a distance from here actually. You know, and their reasons for coming sometimes could be something as simple as their children are enrolled in school here, and um, grandma lives two blocks away and she watches them after school, you know, so it could be something like that, it could be something that easy. [00:12:26] When I was growing up, though, Groton Street was like the Berlin Wall, I mean you just didn't, you know. Well, I did go to school in Queen of Martyrs, but um, you know, it was much more divided than it is now, and a lot of that has, well maybe thankfully disappeared. AB Is that something that happened because of Vatican II, or is that just a change that's happened over time? [00:12:49] MM I think Vatican II had some greater degree of openness to the world, and I think that added a greater sense for lay people to realize their role in the Church. Just because they happened to live in a geographical area, that they must go to that church, I think that sense kind of left them, that, um. You know, most people still go to the church nearest to them, which generally is their parish church, but I think more and more have said, where we find a spiritual home, is where we feel we hear the Gospel preached to us. Or, or sometimes it could be just a matter of convenience, we go to work that way, and that's nearest to us. Or as I said to you before, grandma and grandpa live there, and they're doing the babysitting, you know something like that. I think there's a much greater fluidity, certainly here in Forest Hills, but I think in most areas actually that's true. The Council might have had something to do with it, in the sense that people didn't feel as constrained anymore perhaps. Um, you know, I mean, when I was a boy, Father Molloy and Msgr. McLaughlin at Queen of Martyrs to some degree, were very insistent that you would go to your parish church, even if you went to their school, you came here on Sundays also. That wouldn't happen anymore, if you were going to school there, you would probably go there, you know, so, you know. [00:14:12] Our school is the newer of the two, um, when I was growing up here, there was no school. And Father Molloy, who was the second pastor, was not enthused about building one, for whatever his own personal reasons were. A group of laymen, including my own father, went around and kind of solicited funds. He said -- you know, money has changed so much, it's almost hard to kind of [imagine] -- but he said, if you had, if you have $30,000, or something like that, we'll start. $30,000 of course in the mid-'50s was considerably more money than it is now. And they almost did it, and he said no, and gave the money back. So that, for a long time, the parish, when I was growing up, lacked a center in a sense. It almost continued to be a chapel of ease in a sense, because those parents who wanted their children to go to a Catholic school did what they could to get them into the neighboring parishes, so fellas and girls my age who still live here, or have moved on to other places, all remember going to different grade schools. Some of us went to public school, like I started in public school, here on the next block. I was transferred to Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, others, friends of mine and things went to St. Margaret's in Middle Village, or Holy Child in Richmond Hill, or Sacred Heart in Glendale, which was not so good for the parish because it spread everybody. Your first, your first loyalty might be where you were going to school, you know, so, um, it wasn't until the building of the school, I think, that a greater cohesiveness came into the parish. [00:15:58] But at the same time, unfortunately, around that time, the traditional societies that very often held people together began to die off. When I came back here, I was telling people on Sunday, when I was sent back here, seven years ago, where did the Holy Name Society go? Where's the Rosary Society? These were the groups that really brought out a lot of the people. It's very hard now to get volunteers for these things, because well, everybody's working and everybody's schedules are so crazy, so, but you know, anyway. AB Can you tell me a little more about growing up in Forest Hills, and like, what was it like, switching from public school to the Catholic school? [00:16:44] MM Um, traumatic. [laughs] Not in a bad way, but just that I was very happy at P.S. 144. My father would be very aged now, if he were alive, he'd be 111, and he had grown up in a time where, from the first day of school, you learned how to do script and the times tables. And when I had reached third grade, here, they weren't doing that yet. I had a ball -- we drew pictures, and did finger-paints, and I thought, if this is school, I'm into this. So, um, he was not happy, and he went to Msgr. McLaughlin, I guess. You know, when you're eight, you're not aware of the background material that's going on here. So, Dr. Pearlburg, who was the principal on the next block, begged my mother to leave me there. He said, if I recall correctly now, it's so long ago, you know that they would catch up, that there was a different system in place. But my dad was impatient about it. So I went from a class of twenty-five, now there were about six classes of twenty-five second graders, to one class of about seventy at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs. They became so crowded over there that when my brother started after me, three years later, there were two sessions. There were 120 kids in the first grade, so they had -- the poor nun came one session in the morning, did this, then went to the convent for lunch and whatever chores she had, and then came back in the afternoon and did the same thing over again with the other half. But that was the reason for the change, and my father had the advantage of knowing Msgr. McLaughlin, because they had been here so long, so he knew him. [00:18:28] And I remember the interview, sitting in an office something like this, and him telling me, holding up these drawings that the kids in the third grade had done, and him saying, \"Now Johnny, this is the type of work that we do here, we want you to do this,\" and then saying to my mother, \"Mary, you bring the boy Monday, and see Mother Wenceslas\" -- religious principals usually had the title \"Mother\" -- ahem. And, um, well, first of all, I was startled to realize that my mother had a first name, because when you're a little kid, her first name is \"Mommy.\" And then Monday, when we appeared, Mother Wenceslas was fashionably late, and came in, and I thought I was going to have weeks to think about this, talk it over. And she says to my mother after they got through talking about I guess, you know, does he have his diphtheria shots or whatever, \"Well there's no time like now, Mrs. McGuirl,\" takes my hand, leads me across the hall, there's a door, IN, and, you know, \"You come back and get him at three o'clock this afternoon.\" So there you are. The plunge has been made. So, once I was there you know, I mean, some of the kids from this parish went there, there was a girl around the corner from me that was very helpful, actually, she's still around here, actually, in getting me settled, and I made a lifelong friend then, he's also a priest in this Diocese, Msgr. Edward Ryan, who -- we got to meet because there were no seats, so the Sister looked down the aisle and saw Mr. Ryan was very small, and said, \"Move over a bit, and let the new boy sit down next to you,\" because we were both so tiny that we could occupy the one seat. We're still friendly all these years later. So it was a bit of a trauma, in a sense, because it wasn't really expected, you know; kids are oblivious to what their parents are talking about, and all of a sudden you have this presented to you, \"You're going there,\" you know. [00:20:27] From there, I went to Archbishop Molloy High School, which is still there in Briarwood, and then to the college seminary after that, so um. Because of the fact that we were all scattered, though, unfortunately, there weren't like teams in the parish, not that I was the greatest of athletes, but, there was a lack of center in a sense at that time, which I think the people now are much more fortunate in having. The school still serves that function in parishes that have them. Ours does pretty well, there are about 320 kids there, and it's now an academy, which simply means the governance is moved to a lay board of directors. Myself and my associate are responsible for the spiritual development of the school, but we're not -- the pastor is no longer the, you know, the technical boss anymore. The board of directors is, but you know the parish still owns the school. [00:21:24] Growing up, it was like a small town then. I remember distinctly in the summer, you rarely wore shoes. And you could play in the streets, like wiffle ball or stick-ball or something and very rarely would there be a car, and when they did come through and interrupt the game, they were probably sorry they did. But it was a much smaller atmosphere then, it was really kind of like a small town. There was a lot of open land -- Now I'm sixty-eight years of age, so we're going back a bit -- we're going back sixty years or more. There was still a large farm on Woodhaven Blvd. that had cows, and over here, where the large apartment houses are, much of that space was empty, sometimes used in the summer by carnivals that would come or smaller circuses, um. I still remember the street cars up here on Metropolitan Avenue, the trolley cars. It was a much smaller atmosphere. I think for boys, I'm not sure how much the girls enjoyed it, but when you were a small boy, there were a lot of lots you could play forts in and Indians, you know, I mean, there was a lot more -- there was a lot more playing area, actually. Now there's really just the schoolyard on the next block, which was there then, too, but there was a lot more lots, almost every block had some unoccupied land yet, that's all gone. Except on this block, on the end of the street. There's still one lot, no one seems to know who owns it, or why it's never sold, or -- it's been that way, always. But, it was a good time growing up, I mean, you know, I guess it wasn't too much different than anybody else's, but you know, it was a place. [00:23:17] There was a little bit of social stratification then, though. This area down here, from the church down, is more modest housing. Wooden frame, built around 1925 through about 1930. Our house, as I said, was put up in '25, and my grandparents and my father and his sisters moved in that year. Um, the um, then, there was Forest Hills Gardens, which does keep its own way, you know the streets are owned by the Gardens Corporation, and um, they have their own very strict terms of zoning, what you can do to your house, what you cannot do to your house, you know, and when you move in there you sign a covenant indicating you will abide by those rules. Then between the Gardens and here, beginning right here, where we're sitting in the church actually, is what's called the Van Court Association, which does not own the streets, but keeps somewhat of the Gardens' zoning laws. I'm not quite sure what their penal -- you know if you defy them, I'm not too sure how far they can go in law to force you to observe them, I'm not really sure of that, and I don't wish to find out personally. [00:24:35] At that time though, there was a lot more, I think, sensitivity as to where you were living and maybe what background you had. I can remember as a little boy, I hung around with kids in the Gardens because they went to school with me at Queen of Martyrs, but being informed going over to Station Square -- the green, there, between Greenway North and South -- they used to have a carnival, in the early summer, maybe in June sometime, going to it, being told \"you don't belong here because you don't belong in the Gardens.\" [chuckling] Or a place like the West Side Tennis Club, then, not now, now it's very open and very embracing of everybody -- but walking past that on the way home from school, thinking I will never be in that property, you know, it was -- it was very different. [chuckling] So, um, the um, all of-- much of that has broken down. Thankfully, in a sense, some of that kind of privilege kind of thing. Mrs. Sage, when she -- she was the, Mrs. Russell Sage was the, Olivia, I think her first name was, was the widow of a railroad magnate in this country. She was much younger than him, and she used the money, she wanted to found this garden community for, as it was stated, \"white Anglo-Saxon Protestants,\" working class. What Mrs. Sage considered \"working class,\" and what other people consider \"working class,\" it goes to show kind of a rather elevated sense of who the workers were in the country, because it was built, as it is now obviously, for people of some means. I mean, you don't live in the Gardens unless you've got a little bit of pocket money. And um, but it has varied a great deal, it used to be, well, what Mrs. Sage intended it to be in the beginning, but um, you know, that sort of thing can't be maintained in the present day and age. [00:26:48] AB So can you tell me about the Long Island Railroad coming through here? MM Well, the branch nearest to us, which no longer operates. There's a station at Forest Hills now, about eleven blocks from here. Good service actually, it gets you to Penn Station in fourteen minutes from Forest Hills. Very often, they don't even stop at Woodside. This is the last stop before Manhattan. There used to be another option though. Up 'til about 1950, there's a line over here -- I don't know, you are familiar with it right -- AB Yeah. MM -- that used to run to Rockaway Park. If you go down to Rockaway Park, at 116th Street, the end of the line of what now is the A Train, it'll say over the door, \"Long Island Railroad,\" and that was the last stop on the railroad. That trestle that's up in the Rockaways was built by the LIRR. In 1950, though, and it was something that apparently happened before that -- they had a wooden trestle that crossed Jamaica Bay. And well it had burnt before, because there was no air conditioning, people smoked, so you know, some guy or girl would be smoking, throw the butt out the window, and it would land on the creosote-coated ties, and they're wooden, and it would start to burn and you know so. But on this last time, apparently it happened at a point in the year when there was low tide, and they couldn't get the fire boats near the trestle close enough to put the fire out, and uh, it burnt. I remember as a boy, riding the bus down to Rockaway, and you could see these stumps coming up out of the water. It burnt right through from Hamilton Beach, which is just south of Howard Beach, to Broad Channel. Several communities that depended on the railroad for access, that or boats, the Raunt and Goose Creek, both disappeared because there was no way in or out any more. Now what those communities did about sanitation and everything, you might not want to know [laughing], but they stood on stilts out on the water, and Long Island Railroad had stops there, and I guess they were mostly fishing communities in Jamaica Bay, things like that. [00:29:02] The LIRR continued to run trains to Howard Beach, and then somewhere, and I'm not sure the timing, in the late '50s early '60s, the subway, well, the Transit Authority of New York City, bought the right-of-way between Liberty Avenue and the whole rest of it to Rockaway, with the idea of branching the A Train onto it, which they've done, and that's the subway service that the people in the Rockaways now get, from two directions, one down here, and you can go along the long route around and go into Far Rockaway from Nassau County�s side. The trains continued to run to Howard-- to Ozone Park, and they stopped, I think it was June of 1962. I was on the last train. Myself and Msgr. Ryan who I mentioned earlier, we were teenagers then, about junior year in high school, we decided we were going to ride the last one. So we bought a ticket at Rego Park, there was a station there then, and intending to get off here, which would be about a mile and a half, two miles at the most, but the people that were -- used it every day for commuting to Manhattan -- and it wasn't a bad commute either -- broke out a bottle of champagne, and we were both kind of naive about drinking -- we didn't do anything wrong, but we were afraid to come home with the smell of champagne on our breath, so we rode all the way to Ozone Park. And it was a beautiful ride, I mean, it used to go right through the middle of Forest Park, it was like you were out in the woods someplace, you'd never think you were in NYC. And that was the last day of service. So no trains have run up there since 1962, as it shows; I mean, it's become jungle growth since. The ties and the rails are all in place, the LIRR never pulled them up. And I'm not really too sure who owns the property -- I suspect the MTA, but I'm not positive. [00:31:14] So, as you mentioned, there's been all sorts of talk now of changing that into sort of like the Highway -- what is that -- the Highline in Manhattan, you know, having kind of a walk park kind of thing. Whether that will come to pass or not, is, is -- we're not really in the center of Manhattan, where it's busy all the time. It's a bit remote. AB Right. MM What we could use � do you drive? AB I do. MM Have you driven on Woodhaven Blvd. lately? AB Ahh, no. [Laughing] MM Well, no matter what time of the day, it is a mob scene. And we really could use some north-and-south transportation here. There is no subway line that goes all the way from north to south, and this line of the LIRR, kind of filled that bill, to a degree, at least you got as far as Queens Blvd., but, so I know some city representatives in down Howard Beach, and Broad Channel, Rockaway, are pushing to have it reevaluated possibly as a rail line or perhaps light rail or something, but then there's another group that's very vociferous about turning it into a greenway sort of, you know. [00:32:33] I don't know where I stand on it. I mean I see the need for transportation, because the streets are getting clogged with traffic, even out here. On the other hand, you know, I can understand people who, since 1962, have bought homes along Selfridge or Alderton Street, they have no memory of the trains running there, and now to be told that they might be there again, unless they built like these baffles that you see along the LIE, that they could have noise or racket. You know, of course, I guess there's ways of buttressing that. But you know they're not used to it. They weren't there when they were running. The people that bought houses there originally knew when they were buying, what was in their back yard, you know, so. Where that will be resolved, I don't know. [00:33:22] But when I was a boy in grade school, first starting school, it was still running to Rockaway, and then around, as I said in 1950, it was cut back and then ultimately in '62, back to Ozone. Well, it was going to Ozone Park, and that was the last year. Even if the LIRR had kept it running, even if it only went to Howard Beach, it would have helped congestion out here, but I believe the railroad, which was dominated by the Pennsylvania Railroad then was in one of its many bouts of receivership, couldn't -- was not a state agency yet, couldn't really afford to keep it up and repair track and stations and things like that, so they let it go. AB Can you tell me a little more about that last ride, what it looked like, um, I know-- [00:34:12] MM By then there was only one track operating. If you go up to -- it's hard to get to -- there's playing fields on what used to be a farm, when I was a little tiny guy, and at Fleet Street -- they've now been turned into ball, baseball courts -- the Forest Hills Little League and youth athletic association use it. About a half a mile behind -- and this line runs on its western border -- if you were to go about half a mile north of that, you'd come to what used to be called Whitepot Junction, and Whitepot Junction -- Whitepot was the original name of this area. There's all sorts of reasons why--some say the land was purchased from the Native people with white pots, others say it was some landmark in the area, who knows. But it's there, if you're on 63rd Drive, and you look up, when you go under the main branch of the LIRR, it might seem awfully, for four tracks, an awfully wide trestle. Well, there were once six, because that's where the Rockaway Branch broke off, and the southern passage was easy; they just switched off. The northern one, there was an under-chute, and it went under the railroad and came up the other side. I believe they've had to fill that tunnel in, because teenagers were using it [laughing]. But there's where the train is. There's still a big -- it's all overgrown now, but a big open area there of several acres, where the railroad went up under and then joined the main branch and then came down. [00:35:56] When we got on at Rego Park, of course the first part of the ride up here, to this station up here, Metropolitan was Park Side Station, and it was kind of above the backyards of people's homes. And then, when you cross Metropolitan Avenue, there was that slight industrial area there, where Target and Home Depot and those places are now. And then you entered into Forest Park, and that was the next mile or so, as I said to you before, it was like being out in the country. You would never have realized -- you were hanging out of windows taking pictures, you know, and I have some from that ride here, and you woulda thought, if someone said you were in New York City, you would say, no you're not, you're out in the country some place, you know. And then it broke out of the forest, and you were kind of in Ozone Park, or Woodhaven actually at first, and then Ozone Park. And that's then where it ended. It was a nice ride, a pleasant ride, because there was no air conditioning in those days, the only way to get air into the cars was to open all the windows, so you know, but the Long Island over the years had decreased traffic to the degree that this was basically one track. They lowered the platforms, there was a wooden platform here that you entered a door level, with station houses and everything, and they had all been kind of abandoned, so they were in a bad, bad state of disrepair by then. There was one track used, and they had actually put a new platform on ground level, over one of the tracks actually, here at Park Side, so you knew they weren't operating that. And service had been reduced to I think like two trains in the morning and two trains in the afternoon, so they would never meet anything, there was no need to have the two tracks and keeping them up because you know the two in the morning go to Manhattan and the two in the afternoon come out, and there was nothing -- they weren't going to meet anything coming in the other direction, so. [00:37:54] Again, it was a bit of short-sightedness, but who knew? You know, even 1962, Queens was quite a bit different than it is now. Who knew that the congestion, that people would think honestly about owning more than one car in a family and things like that, that the people don't use their garages any more, they use them for storage, almost everybody -- even in the Gardens, which kind of surprises me, because that used to be taboo, park in the streets now. Many of these streets really are not made for parking on both sides and a lane of traffic in between. It's -- if you have rear-view mirrors that stick out, you wonder if you're gonna lose them on some of the streets. So with a little bit more of looking ahead, they might have kept it open. It would have provided very good service for folks down this way, and in Glendale, and Ozone Park and Woodhaven, very good access to the city. Because once again, going north -- there were several stations south of here -- Brooklyn Manor, Ozone Park itself, there was another one in there, the name escapes me, Park Side here in Forest Hills, and then Rego Park, and then once, one more stop in Woodside, and then you were in Manhattan, you know, so I mean it had possibilities, but I guess they weren't thinking along those lines then. LIRR was in a state of kind of pulling back where they didn't think service was heavy. Even many of the Queens stations -- like there was a station at Elmhurst once, and now there's talk of putting it back in, because Elmhurst has boomed, and there's a huge population. The subway can barely contain all the people that want to get to Manhattan on the E and the F every day. And the railroad is parallel. In southeastern Queens, some stations were kind of ignored, and there, people can very rightfully complain that they have no transportation. You've got to take a bus to Jamaica and then another bus, and so -- just, if you're gonna work for Manhattan, and you live in St. Alban's, or Baisley Park, Laurelton, places like that, Rosedale, you really have a hike every day, you know, and it helps very much if the railroad has those stations running, because it's much more convenient. [00:40:10] As a senior now, I can get half-fare here off-peak, and that means it's only a little bit higher than the subway, and you're bound to get a seat, and even if you shouldn't on some day, you're gonna be in Manhattan in fourteen minutes, anybody could stand for that distance. So, it would have been, had they kept it running, a good thing I think for the community and the area, but what's done is done, I suppose. And now, you have difference of opinions and rather strong ones about how it should be used you know, or should it be used or just sit there and moulder. AB Right. MM Even if it becomes a greenway, they're going to have to do a lot of work, because when the railroad was running, obviously then there were no trees on the top of it, you know, trains kept them from running - growing. Now, it's like jungle growth, you know, and unless you're going to get kind of a wild jungle sense of it, but I'm sure they want to put a walkway in. So a lot work is going to have to be done, no matter what's done with it. If it becomes a walkway, obviously, the rails that have been sitting there in a very bad state now, the ties a lot of them have rotted, the third rail has collapsed of its -- you know, the little insulators it�s on -- but all that would have to come up. I know at least one of the tracks on the Highway-- the Highline in Manhattan, they've kept some of the trackage just to keep it, but you know its flowerbeds and things. I think one of the problems they'll face here too will be maint -- not only maintenance, but also security. We're not in the middle of Manhattan, and at night, this can be a very quiet neighborhood. I remember walking once from Woodhaven Blvd., a few years back, after taking the subway into Manhattan, got off with a friend at Woodhaven Blvd./Slattery Place, and walked from there, and the whole distance after I left him, I met about one person. Now where I was formerly at Jackson Heights for twelve years at St. Joan of Arc, you didn't walk out the back door and walk five feet before you met all sorts of people. So it is very quiet, which a lot of people relish. It's a quiet neighborhood, you don't have the racket and the noise that many neighborhoods do have, but I suppose the downside of that is that has to be secured, and who's going to do that? Do they have patrolmen up there at night? Or are they gonna have -- the people that are worried about having the trains in their backyard might be worried also about having, well, you know, kids are kids. [00:43:06] I was one once, too, and I remember once going up there to watch the trains on Sunday when I was expected to join my parents for -- they used to have Benediction and Rosary here in the afternoon before there were any evening Masses. My parents always went, and I didn't show up on time. My father came looking, he must have asked somebody on the block where I was. It's the only time he ever hit me in public, because they were afraid, because there had been a couple of electrocutions, kids that crawled up under the fences and touched the third rail. I remember them warning us, at P.S. 144, never go there, never go up in it, you know, and of course, boys are boys. Warned, that means you might do it [laughing]. If my parents knew where I went on a bike at that age, but they were smart enough -- �Where were you?� Out. �Who were you with?� People, friends. �Where did you go?� Around. Around sometimes meant taking the bike to Howard Beach or out to Bayside [chuckling]. [00:44:02] So, you know, we'll see what happens. I don't -- the City moves slowly, so I expect to be well into retirement by the time anything happens over there, but you know. And there's two very valid points of view, I think: one, that it'd be nice to have like a garden that runs from Forest Park up to almost to Queens Blvd. On the other hand, we certainly could use public transportation in central Queens. I went to Manhattan -- I have a Sister-friend who's not well in Yardley, Pennsylvania -- and some friends and I went down to see her. We took the Jersey transit from Penn Station to Trenton, and a Sister picked us up there, but I took the LIRR in, I guess it was Martin Luther King Day, and I was surprised at the number of people waiting for the train. The Long Island over here, and that's every day. Years back, you'd have a handful of people getting on here. Not anymore, because the subway is such a mob scene. It was built at a time where a lot of the apartment houses on Queens Blvd. were not there. And every time they build another one, there's never any sense of planning in Queens. You need to think about the infrastructure. How are you going to put up another 30-story apartment house and ask those people to get on to already-crowded subway trains to get to Manhattan? And most people, most people still work in Manhattan. There's never a thought about that. You go to Continental Avenue in the morning, it's a mob scene. So anyway� [00:45:46] AB I have just one more question for you. I was just curious, what made you decide to become a priest? MM I thought about it in grade school, which was not uncommon then, many boys did. And there was a priest at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, he was a young priest then, Father Michael Conroy. He's deceased now, for about ten, ten or more years. He had -- he was very influential. He came to the classes, and he was running a club for the kids after school, called the \"Olquom\" Club, the Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Club, that's OLQM, \"O-L-Q-M Club.\" We all belonged to it, you know, you looked at him, and you'd say, \"he's doing good things for people.\" There was a certain mystique about it, certainly. And part of that was he knew a language - we didn't all know Latin. I think for a small boy, that, you know, you purify or clarify your beliefs over the years about why you did it, but I think at first there's that kind of that attraction that kids might have even to being a fireman or a policeman, you know, the uniform and everything. Very small children might think, I wanna be a fireman, they think about saving people, they never think about -- and they can't think about, at that age -- the, um, the, well, the ugly part of life that firemen, fire personnel get to see, burning, people burned in fires, or that policemen get to see regularly. But there's a sense of that, there was a sense of that. The sisters all looked -- in those days, virtually, Queen of Martyrs, every class, there was a sister in charge, and they helped. I mean, they were living symbols of dedication to God and to his people. This was the day when everybody wore a -- all the sisters wore a full habit. And very often, the sisters had kind of looked around also to see who, what girl might be good for the convent -- not that they pushed it, but they kind of, you know, maybe clarified your thinking a bit. I had wanted to go to Cathedral High School, which was then in Brooklyn. (The Brooklyn branch was closed, the Queens branch that was built later is still over here in Elmhurst, 56-25 92nd Street.) And my parents said no. I tended to be tall and lanky that hasn�t changed, and a lot of tall kids out of their turn are a little bit shy about it, and I think they thought if I went into kind of what was then a very restricted high school, nowadays it would not be, but certainly then it was, that it might not be best for Junior, so they said you can go to any other high school, they got the cold shoulder for about a month, but I settled on Molloy, because it was near, almost within walking distance. But the idea never left, and after Molloy, I applied then to Cathedral College, which was also located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, not now, but it was then. So I think it was the example of both the sisters and Father Conroy. The priests here were good men, but we didn't have, except for Sunday Mass, you didn't have much relationship with them because, as I mentioned, there was no school, and therefore there was not -- where you went to school was much more your center of attention, though I was an altar server here and continued to serve until I was about seventeen years of age, as a good number, as some still do. We have several young men and girls that are serving well into high school. So I think it was all of those things, my parents certainly practiced their faith. So it was part of their whole way of life, too, I mean, you know your parents gave good example in terms of their practice. They never, they certainly never pushed. I think a lot of families, they knew, in Irish family they want someone to be a priest. Well, mine didn't, particularly. They didn't stand in my way, but they were not exactly thrilled. Until I was a deacon, and that would have been in the fourth year of post-college theological study where they began to realize -- I was stationed part of the year at St. Teresa's in Woodside, and they would start to come to Mass there on Sunday, and I think they saw the reception I had, and the rapport I had with the people and they with me. So I think they kind of began to realize maybe this was what I was cut out to do. Even before that, they had gone to -- I had worked in the summer, several summers, in Transfiguration parish in Williamsburg, Marcy Avenue Brooklyn, and they were starting to come down to the plays. There was a sister there, Sister Marce2, she just died last year, two years ago, actually, and she was dead-serious about the plays she ran. I mean, she got the libretto, and rented them, and the kids -- there was no just heel and toe and away we go sort of thing, it was you know, shows. They put on The West Side Story and The Sound of Music and others. And I'd look out in this sea of almost all Hispanic faces, and see these two -- my parents had complexions that if they walked across the yard in the summer without a hat they were bound for heat prostration [sic]. And I said, \"What did you-- how did you get here?\" \"We came on the bus.\" \"And you walked through the south side, Los Sures?\" which then was tough territory. \"Beautiful, warm lovely people, they walked us right to the door.\" So I think that helped too, that they saw that their son, whom, I think, surprisingly they thought could relate with the folks who lived down there and was picking up some Spanish and things like that. You know I guess parents -- not being one, I can't exactly say, but -- I guess at some point parents, too begin to realize that maybe this is what their kids are cut out for, that this was meant to be. [00:51:51] So they certainly influenced younger years, you know, prayer at home, and regular attendance at Mass, and as I mentioned earlier in the course of another story, coming back on Sunday afternoons for benediction and rosary. The fact that they wanted me in Catholic schools after my debut in P.S. 144. And I think Father Conroy, and not for just myself, Msgr. Ryan, also who I met in grade school would talk about Father Mike's kind of influence, that he was, you know, very present to the kids, and many of the sisters were. I remember my seventh grade Sister, who I believe is still alive in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Sister John-Berkmans, would go out and toss a football around with the boys. And that made a big impression then, that the sisters were able to relate that way, that they were real human beings, and she knew how to throw the ball better than most of the boys did actually. We had a couple of winners, though, one sixth grade Sister was [wags finger] -- but most of the sisters were very fine women and really gave themselves to this. You know, when you think of the conditions they worked in -- you know, seventy kids in a room -- and younger sisters, double periods, same class over, twice a day, the same thing over again, starting seven in the morning and ending up around six in the evening. So I think all of those influences -- I can't say at what moment; that's like -- I don't know if you're seeing anybody, but that'd be like saying, \"When did you fall in love with your boyfriend?\" You know is there a moment you can go back to? \"Oh well it was July 4, 19 -- 2013, or something when we fell in love.\" You grow into it, really, and is there a point where you realize you fell in love, and I suppose it's the same thing. [00:53:43] It's been a good life. I mean, it's not been the easiest period to live in as a 2 Sister Marcella. priest, for very obvious reasons that you and everybody else read about rather regularly in the newspapers. The shame of it is many of those cases, as tragic and as horrid and sinful and criminal as they may have been, were also a long time ago, and they keep on re-drumming this and re-drumming this, and it's very hard to live with that. Because you do wonder on Sundays, what do these folks out in front really think about you? I mean, the reception seems to be great, and people like you, and \"Father, we want you to stay here,\" but every once in a while, that thought comes, \"What do these folks really think?\" [00:54:27] And it hasn't been the easiest period to be a priest. We also experienced -- you mentioned it earlier -- the Council. I grew up expecting that, you know, you'd be using Latin for the rest of your life. I had to take seven or eight years of it; never did particularly well with it, but now remember more than most. Well, a priest friend of mine kids and says, when we were ordained, we still expected we'd go to a parish where there'd be three priests, plus the pastor who would be in semi-retirement who would do the work, there'd be a convent filled with nuns, and then all of a sudden, the bottom all dropped out of that really within a year or two after my ordination. So now we have a parish, there's two of us here, and neither of us -- I'm, well, I'm not young at all, and he's 37, and you might say, well, that's, that's pretty young. It is, but years back, it wasn't. When you said you had a young priest, you meant you had someone who was 26 or 27 years of age, not 37 or 38, you know, that was middle-aged. And that has all changed, so we've had to adapt quite a bit, and the role of the laity, of course has increased, first of all because it should've. I mean, you guys are 99.9% of the Church, but also maybe sometimes, what drives that is maybe the more negative thing, and that is that there's not going to be enough priests, and there aren't now enough sisters. I mean, the active religious orders -- some of those that have kept, like the Little Sisters of the Poor were here yesterday, they run Queen of Peace Residence in Queens Village, they serve the elderly, and that's it. If you want to do something else, you don't join them. You join them you want to serve the elderly. They've kept the habit, they've kept a formalized way of life, and they do get some people, not a lot, but they get some. Whereas a lot of the active communities, like the Sister Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary that served here, they really get nobody now. I mean, it's a real crisis for them. I mean, what are they going to do? Not to make light of it at all, but what are their plans for the end, in a way? [00:56:46] Some of the newer communities that have evolved out west -- there's several Dominican communities -- but if you join them, you teach. That's what you do. You're not gonna go and do pastoral services, you're not gonna do social work, you're gonna teach. And maybe because of that, because they've kept one particular identity, they do get people. But unfortunately, they're not here on the east coast. So we really have gone through an earthquake-like change in the last forty or so years, and those of us still around that remember that. Some of the younger guys coming out really don't understand. We have a deacon coming on weekends, and he's only 26, and he'll be ordained in June. Well I was a priest long before he was born. And my associate, too. I've been a priest 42 years, he's 37, so I could have baptized him also. They don't have any idea what really you went through, the craziness that went on. The kind of the, the lid was lifted off the pot, and bingo! And, you know, so and wild stuff that went on. Just. It was all accepted. That's why sometimes even some of these cases that you hear about in terms of priests -- of religious doing what they should not have done, but you're judging what went on then by modern standards. It's like people who complain about the Crusades or something. Yeah, but the Crusades were the twelfth century. Now you wouldn't do that. But then, that was seen as being the thing to do. Like I remember cases where kids would be living in rectories because they were thrown out of their homes. Well in a million years, you wouldn't do that now. Even if a kid was out in the street, you wouldn't invite them to live here. You'd try to get them into Covenant House or something like that. But it was a different time and place. Unfortunately maybe. [00:58:48] But not the best period to live in, though I have to say there's been a great amount of personal satisfaction, in terms of -- even people you hear from now, sometimes people you haven't heard from in a good long time will call you up and say, \"Father, I remember what you said in class when I was in eighth grade\" -- I have no memory of it, you know, but apparently it hit them. Even yesterday, a boy who's had some high school problems was in to talk for a while. So you know you hit people in a lot of different ways, sometimes you're unaware of. One of the difficulties -- and probably your own if you go into teaching, Abby, later on, or whatever, however you see living out your degree, probably teaching of some sort -- is that your influence on young people particularly is�it's long-term. They -- you may not hear at first. You know, they graduate, they go away, and then all of a sudden, you get that letter twenty years from now, that says, \"Oh I remember what you said in class, and it changed my life,\" you know, you had no idea you had done that. You don't even remember actually what you had said, but they remembered. So its things like that. It's been satisfying. [01:00:00] As our numbers get smaller, I do worry a bit, like what's gonna be ahead. The clergy, just as the Diocese is changing very much, demographically, as New York City does. It's always shifting from new groups of immigrants coming, or people from other parts of the country like yourself [chuckles]. But also, like, for instance, the ordination classes this year, many would be of a Hispanic background, there might be a couple Filipinos, and these are Hispanics who are born here. Their parents might have been born overseas, so there's been a shift. When I was ordained, almost inevitably everybody had an Irish or Italian last name. And even those that had one name or another very often were half. I think in my class of twenty-three when we were ordained was probably about easily fifteen probably had an Irish surname. Now that would be very very rare. Very rare. A Hispanic surname would probably be -- which is good, because very often they're bilingual and certainly we have a large Hispanic population. I can muddle along in Spanish, but you are not speaking to Cervantes, and you never will. I don't know is there anything else you want to know? AB I think that pretty much covers everything that I was hoping to cover. MM Alright, alright. Well, if there's anything you think of, Abby, when you get back to school and say, \"Oh drat, I should've asked him that but forgot about it,\" feel free to call. AB Okay. MM Alright. AB Alright. And this has been Abby Banks and Monsignor McGuirl, and its March 3rd, I think, 2014. ",

  "Menikou_Panayiotis_timecode.txt": "My name is Panayiotis Menikou. I�m a store owner. I started this store Euromarket six years ago. I am Greek from Cyprus. I moved here in 1980. Before I had Cyprus Deli, another nice, little store, and six years ago we started this one. When I had the small store on 30th Avenue, a lot of people asked for their products. So I had the idea that they need these products, and I found out there isn�t a big supermarket for them. We have Yugoslavian products, Bosnian, Serbians, Montenegrins, Polish, Greek, all these Eastern bloc countries. Slowly, slowly we are going to have everything. They have companies that import. And then I�m the retailer. I buy from them. Beer is my very thing! Because the other store Cyprus Delhi was very famous for the beers. We were the first ones to have all these German and Belgian beers. Here we sell more than seven hundred kinds, beers from all over the world. My own favorite is Duvel from Belgium. Everybody has a different taste, different satisfaction. Duvel is a full beer, strong, I like it. Before this place was a pool place. It was closed for a couple of years. Then one day I was passing by and I get the idea to make it a supermarket. It�s getting better now. It was very hard at the beginning, to make the people come. The location is off the Avenue, so you have to make the people know it�s here. That takes time. It�s getting better now. We have more products, and more people know. There used to be a lot of Greek people here. Now there is not, everything is changing. A lot of Spanish people, Mexicans, Yugoslavians, different nationalities, they are coming in here. Also there is a lot of development which brings a lot of people. Mostly we employee people from the neighborhood. I�ve lived here for 31 years. I don�t need to change. I like it because it feels like you are in Europe, first of all. Close to my house is everything. The city is only 10-15 minutes, any time I want to go to the city, I take the train and I go. It�s cheaper, and safer. I work every day, seven days. I have someone who opens the store about 8 o�clock. I come here around 9.30 or 10 and I stay here till midnight. No, not much time to do other things. Once or twice a year I take a trip to Greece to see my family. No kids, I�m single, my business takes my life! 2nd audio file: So Cyprus has been occupied by the Turkish military since 1974. When the invasion was happening I was fourteen years old. They were killing everybody. They came from the north towards the south. My father put us in a tractor and we drove south to save ourselves. So my father was in the street one day with five kids. I have two brothers and two sisters. And my mother too. I said I wanted to take the radio; I had our big radio all ready. He said oh no, you�re going to break it. We thought we�d only leave for one day, two days and go back. And we never went back until now. So we worked hard. And then when we finished high school, we had to go to the army of course. Then we wondered what to do after that. So some friends from the army they had come to college here. So they registered us in a school here. I went to Queens College to learn English. Then I brought my brother, and then my other brother, and then my sister. Everybody came here to study. Now you can cross. My brothers went to see my house. But I didn�t go. I don�t feel like going. You know, Turkish people are living inside your house; you have to ask for permission to go. This is ridiculous. My father is not alive any more. He passed away in 1991. I think all this heavy stuff happening to him, it was bad for him. My brothers went. And they took my sister was thirteen months old when she left. They took her to show her where she was born and where she made her first steps. But I don�t want to go. I know everything. We have a lot of land there. Today worth a lot of money, maybe $50 million. And next to our land was one of the best beaches, Famagusta. We always hope. Cyprus is beautiful. And the economy is not that bad at the moment. We have a lot of tourism. ",
  "Menzie_Larry_timecode.txt": "Larry Menzie is an LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transgender) activist in Queens, who participated in the formative stages of the Queens Pride organization in the 1990�s and the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens. He was a primary founder of Generation Q, the first LGBT specific youth organization in Queens, now an afterschool drop-in center for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer youth and allies, between the ages of 13 and 19. He was born in Hicksville, Long Island and has lived there, in Manhattan, and Forest Hills most of his life. He is a social worker who previously worked as a Parole Officer and is now the Executive Director and Clinical Director of Queens Counseling for Change. The agency utilizes a variety of evidence based approaches to treat and prevent sexual abuse/violence by assisting primarily parolees, probationers, and individuals involved with criminal and family courts throughout the NYC area. 00:00:00 Larry Menzie was interviewed at his apartment, located in Forest Hills on December 6, 2017 at 2:03 p.m. 00:00:49 Larry was born in Hicksville, Long Island in October 1969. He lived there until he was 21. He obtained his Master�s Degree in Social Work in 1994. That year, he moved to Manhattan, where he lived until 1997. When he became a Parole Officer, in 1998, he had to locate away from the people he supervised, so he moved to Queens. He lived at LeFrak City (Corona), then Parker Towers (Forest Hills) in 2006. In Forest Hills, he moved to his current apartment at Kennedy House, Forest Hills, in 2009. Except for a year in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has lived his entire life in New York. 00: 02:28 Larry got involved as an activist in Queens in 1998, because he wanted to continue his involvement in volunteer activity. He had been a volunteer in both gay and non-gay causes most of his adult life. In Manhattan, he volunteered for the Gay and Lesbian Switchboard, counseling gay people, especially those with HIV. 00:03:04 He learned about LGBT organizations in Queens when he attended a resource fair for LGBT organizations at Borough Hall in Forest Hills in 1998. About 60 people attended and ten LGBT organizations described their goals to the participants. Larry joined the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens and the Queens Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee. *00:03:50 He worked with Danny Dromm and many others on the Pride Parade. At that time, the parade was organized entirely by volunteers, who also organized fundraisers to support the parade because there was no public funding. It was built on �sweat equity.� Because he was a sworn law enforcement officer, he was asked to provide security to those that handled money for LGBT fundraisers. At that time, [the late 1990�s] people threatened gay people in Queens, and his presence was requested as a precaution. In Elmhurst, an out gay man ran for political office and he was threatened by a New York Post reporter who said he would �kick his teeth in.� At that time, Queens was conservative. 00:07:40 Between 1992-1999, many LGBT organizations �bubbled-up� in Queens, including PFLAG. Larry also served as the social services chair of Pride, due to his social work experience. Gay activists realized that if it was not safe for gay adults, it was not safe for young gay people. There was a need to be aware of security issues in the time period of 1999-2000. *00:09:15 The Pride Committee received $10,000 in 1999, the organization�s first public funding. Generation Q was formed in his living room. He and Danny Dromm worked together to organize the first event for lesbian and gay youth, which occurred in April 1999 at Borough Hall. Three kids showed up and they were shocked to find they were 13 and 14, instead of the 18 or 19 year olds they expected. They wanted to create a �safe-space� that was not structured and let the kids be themselves. 00:11:30 They organized a contingent for LGBT youth for the Queens Pride Parade in June of 1999 and about 30 kids showed up. They also marched in the Pride Parade in Manhattan. They produced the early youth events with the AIDS Center of Queens County [ACQC], who advertised LGBT youth events and offered space for events. 00:13:28 They organized dance events for young LGBT people, held across the street from Borough Hall in the �Darth Vader� room in Kew Gardens. Larry advertised the dances by going to the only other place young LGBT people gathered during the late 1990�s, the Piers in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. He would pass out flyers and let young people know about the dances. He felt it was necessary, as it was so important for young LGBT people to have a safer place to gather if they lived in Queens. 00:14:32 The dances were very successful, often, up to 300 people attended them. He used his experience as a parole officer to create a �safe-place,� yet with firm boundaries, and the formula worked for the most part. There was only one fight during one of the dances and they held many of them. Over time, the youth got to know the older LGBT people, learning they had role-models. Giving kids that �first moment� when they realized how many other LGBT kids there were in Queens was worth all the work he put into these early events. 00:16:29 Gen Q is now a part of the Pride Parade Organization. By 2000, they moved to the Rainbow Community Center in Corona from Kew Gardens. This was not as safe and some youth, especially women, stopped attending events. 00:18:47 On 8/22/2001, Edgar Garzon was murdered in Queens. His death was considered a hate crime, just as Julio Rivera�s was earlier. The community galvanized around the issue, although it was soon overshadowed by the 9/11/2001 events. 00:20:14 In 2002, Gen Q moved from the Rainbow Center to Astoria. They stayed at the Rainbow Center until 2007. In 2005, he and Danny Dromm withdrew as active participants. They were able to turn over operations to the Queens Community House. They had started SAGE Queens, an organization for senior LGBT people, and the organization could incorporate a youth group. 00:21:30 Queens Pride grew throughout the early 2000�s. They encountered public homophobia. For example, in 2000, they testified for public funding for Queens Pride from Queens Borough and were not publicly named as an LGBT group. Homophobia in Queens continued during the 2005-2006 time-period, when they were harassed by people who stalked them and they were told to �keep it� in Manhattan by other Queens residents. 00:23:25 Larry was the communications director of Lesbian Gay Democratic Club of Queens (LGDCQ), responsible for the publication of the newsletter and advertising events. He oversaw taking it from a paper newsletter that had to be mailed, to fully emailing it and using social media. When LGDCQ first formed, politicians in Queens avoided publicly associating with them, because pictures of them at an LGBT event could be used against them during a primary election. Danny Dromm and other members insisted they have the �Lesbian �Gay� part of their name published and forced politicians and the public to acknowledge the club as a lesbian and gay identified group. They slowly gained acceptance from politicians by �pounding the pavement� for them, walking precincts at elections and attending their fundraisers. They would insist the group be publicly acknowledged as a lesbian and gay group each time they helped out. They backed people who lost but were clear they only supported those who supported the LGBT community. Eventually, they could back winning candidates who supported the LGBT community. *00:25:38 By the time Christine Quinn became the first lesbian speaker of the New York City Council, she acknowledged the help of the Queens politicians, and the active involvement of the LGDCQ Club. This was a watershed moment for the LGDCQ Club and for Queens, with the retirement of Tom Manton and the election of Joe Crowley, who supported the LGBT community in Queens. By 2000, politicians in Queens began to attend their events and publicly acknowledged the Club. Today, they would not dare not support the LGBT community in Queens. *00:28:09 Menzie attributes their success in gaining political support to a lot of �little steps� of coming out publicly and �getting to know people� so there is �less of a barrier� between each other. Danny Dromm would insist if the LGDCQ Club participated in an event, they would hold their pink banner proudly, and politicians had to be public about their active alliance with the LGBT community. 00:29:45 Today, in 2017, the Pride Committee of Queens gets money from public arts groups and they need less volunteers and fundraisers to hold the event. Most of the street festivals are done by a group with public resources. They used to have to clean their own streets after the parade, now the Sanitation Department cleans up! Organizing was more time consuming before social media allowed instant advertising of an event. �Winter Pride� is their signature event for elected officials, where over 400 people show up. 00:32:01 Larry hopes that for the future, due to the recent election of President Trump and Republican majorities in Congress, they can protect what they have. Although they had been more hopeful in 2016 of �moving on� from primarily LGBT issues, they now work with others to ensure all minorities, including LGBT people, are not abandoned by officials. They emphasize that all issues intersect, LGBT, class, race, and gender. For example, criminal justice is an issue for the LGBT people as they face disparate issues when they are arrested and incarcerated. They work with those in the LGBT community, especially transgender people and people of color, who face life with more limited incomes. Politicians are often surprised that their club asks about many issues, not just LGBT ones, because they are also of concern to them. 00:35:15 Today, Gen Q is located at the Queens Community House. It hosts a daily drop-in center for youth. They do not hold as many dances as they do not have a place to hold that many people. 00:35:45 At the Central Y of Queens, there is a program for LGBT youth. It was started by Long Island Pride and is supported by Danny Dromm. 00:36:54 Larry likes living in Forest Hills. It has always been, and still is, known for being a safe and secure community. Most of the community work he did was in Jackson Heights. There is an �OUT-Forest Hills� social group that was formed by Paul Mcnamee. Dirk McCall started OUT Astoria and OUT Bronx and OUT Rockaways. People join these groups and attend their social events, and usually learn how to get involved in other LGBT groups. Still, you don�t see a lot of visible LGBT people in Queens, making public displays of affection like holding hands, even in 2017. It is still not safe to do that. Forest Hills is dealing with housing issues and that will change the community. 00:39:30 Larry has always been a political activist. He knew he wanted to be a social worker when he was 16, and become an advocate for social change. He worked on issues of homeless, the mentally ill, and those who were HIV positive. This was due, in part, to growing up on Long Island and being bullied from the time he was in kindergarten to high school. He was determined to protect people due to his own experiences. 00:41:16 As a young adult, he worked with those on Rikers Island who had been diagnosed with the HIV virus, which in the early 1990�s, was a death sentence. He participated in a switchboard that provided advice to those diagnosed with the HIV virus. 00:41:43 When he became a Parole Officer, he was the only �out� gay Parole Officer he was aware of. He had to work with his fellow officers to educate them and ensure they would work as a team to protect each other. It was pretty �scandalous� to be a gay Parole Officer in 1998. Only years later, did he realize the harassment he went through. Now, there are a lot more out LGBT parole officers and the agency is a lot more tolerant. *00:43:38 Currently, he is a social worker and an activist for change in the criminal justice system, working primarily to reform the treatment of people convicted of crimes of sexual violence. He started his own agency. He is President of the New York State Alliance for the Prevention of Sexual Abuse. He works to end the harsher treatment of LGBT people when they are accused of sexual crimes. Both reforms [LGBT rights and criminal justice] have a similar pathway to social change, educating people for change through evidence based practices. *00:48:15 Besides Councilmember Danny Dromm, other LGBT leaders in Queens include John Rusillo [active in Pride and Democratic Club, housing issues], Ed Mallon [transit specialist], Maritza Martinez [Verizon], and Bruce Friedman [President of LGDCQ and active in LGBT causes]. Over the years, they were role models because they worked in professions such as housing, transportation, telecommunications and demonstrated that LGBT people could work as professionals and were everywhere in society. This message was very important for LGBT people in Queens coming of age in the last 20 years. Also, there were many people of less �power and means� who gave their time freely as volunteers to empower LGBT organizations, who worked in labor, such as the mail room, who contributed to the success of these organizations. They used computers and copy machines at work to advertise events. They also were important role models for LGBT people in Queens. Not everyone who is gay is rich and living on Fire Island. *00:52:30 Larry emphasizes that many �small steps� were important contributions to the greater empowerment of LGBT people. One example was using their LGBT Queens Club credit card at COSTCO that clearly stated they were a Lesbian Gay organization. Clerks either reacted uncomfortably or mentioned that their relatives attended Gay Pride. It took courage in the early days just to use the card to purchase items, but they did it nonetheless, because they knew they needed to be visible throughout Queens. These were moments of personal �activism and insecurity.� *00:53:37 As an activist in Queen, Larry was required to challenge himself and gain leadership skills he would not have obtained had he stayed in Manhattan. In Queens, he was on the �front-lines� and needed to learn to speak publicly, organize events, run organizations, speak to public officials, and reach out to people who did not favor LGBT people. These skills gave him the confidence to excel later in this career and start his own advocacy organization. Both require him to talk to others about uncomfortable issues. All of the small things give us the �big splashes.� 00:56:11 As a social worker, he never earned enough to live in Manhattan, so he stayed in Queens because he could afford it. It gave him a sense of community, which enveloped him early in his time here. He could work in small but important ways and see changes in Queens. 00:57:45 He hopes that Queens will become increasingly more tolerant. We need to protect those most vulnerable to the current administration, like LGBT immigrants, who face death if they are returned to their original countries. Schools must be pressured to create an atmosphere free of harassment and bullying. They need to support newly formed LGBT organizations in Queens, such as the one for South Asian LGBT people. *1:01:05 A reminder of the need for constant vigilance was the recent gay bashing of students in the Bronx. An LGBT student attacked others as a response to a bullying incident. Due to economic vulnerabilities, we must ensure LGBT youth have safe places in homeless shelters. �When we fix a problem, we don�t rest, we move on.� A lot of people have �made this happen.� Many �took risks� in attending an LGBT event. �Many small things created the big change.� 1:04:26 The interview ended at 3:07 p.m. on December 6, 2017.

  "Miles_Janet_timecode.txt": "Janet Miles grew up in Pennsylvania before moving to upstate New York. She later relocated to different boroughs of New York City from Manhattan to the Bronx then Brooklyn before ending up in Queens. Janet resides at Jamaica Residence with her husband and twin sons. She discusses the hardships of living in a shelter and what the experience has taught her. She hopes to move out in the near future and eventually leaving New York City and owning a home. 00:00:20 Janet grew up in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Growing up she did a lot of sport activities. Her parents had a boat so would Jet Ski and do summer activities on the lake. Her parents also had a motorhome so they traveled down the East Coast on vacation. In 1995, she wanted some change so she moved Oyster County from Pennsylvania. It was very rural upstate. The person she was seeing at the time had parents there. She worked in an office as a secretary and first started Dental School. She later went on to work for two different dental offices. She moved to Queens in 2011. 00:02:50 In 2001, Janet was incarcerated and was paroled in New York City. Growing up, she often visited Philadelphia so the change from suburbs to urban wasn’t so different. She understood subways and bus. After parole, she got wiser and paid the price for her mistakes. She wants to get out of the city and the goal is now to move back to the suburbs. 00:04:20 Janet and her family were living in the Bronx and they had a really bad landlord. They entered the shelter system in 2009. Back then you were moved around shelter to shelter so they were in a couple Bronx shelters, then Brooklyn before ending up in Queens. In the Bronx, they chose not to pay rent because the landlord wasn’t fixing anything. They took her to Housing Court but nothing came out of it. If she knew the programs that were out there then that she knows now, they would’ve taken a different route than coming into a shelter. “This is our first time in a shelter, a long time, but our first time and I don’t want to come back.” 00:05:50 This site is a city run shelter in comparison to a privately owned shelter. There are only a few city-run shelters left. This shelter is not as bad as other places they’ve been but it’s no place to raise children. Tier two shelters are privately owned buildings that are rented out by Homeless Services and those owners get a lot of money to house a family. For example, for a family of four, you would receive $4,000/month. The Coalition for the Homeless is trying to say that instead of housing families, that money should be used to pay a portion of their rent. The Mayor has opened up a lot of housing options since last April. The key is for the move out to be permanent so you don’t come back to a shelter. 00:07:55 A couples years ago when the numbers were down in the population of homelessness, they would often transfer you so you don’t become comfortable in one place for too long. Now that the homeless population is so high, they don’t transfer you anymore unless something severe happens within the shelter. 00:08:35 This is a non-cooking facility. A lot of the private shelters are regular apartments. Janet is not used to not cooking. You’re not allowed to have hot places. She has children that need to eat properly. “We do what we have to do.” 00:09:25 They’ve been in the Jamaica Residence for 5 years and they were not expecting to be there that long. They got caught between the old vouchers, (advantage vouchers) that Mayor Bloomberg cut off for three years. There was no housing so basically people sat and waited until Mayor De Blasio came and reinstated them. 00:10:16 When they first came in, it was very rough. There were a lot of fights amongst residence and staff. A lot of drinking that was allowed at the time. The new director tightened things up. The new director has big changes for the better. The environment changes as people move in and out. 00:11:40 Breakfast is from 6-7:30 am. The kids are in school by 8 am. During the day Janet does housing searches. Lunch is from 12-1 pm. Dinner is from 5:30-7 pm. Tuesday night, York college alumnus come in and do seminars. Fourth World comes in on Wednesday and does children’s arts and crafts. On Thursday, New York Cares comes in and does arts and crafts. They used to have game night but that got taken away. Big Buddies from Queens College come in on Saturdays. 00:13:00 Her sons, Matt and Mark, got perfect attendance, the only two in the building, and were rewarded a trip to Washington DC. They have little trips here and there. They went to Broadway and watched Matilda. 00:13:30 The experience mentally drained Janet but she’s a stern individual. Even though it’s a shelter, she runs a tight ship. The kids are expected to go to bed and school on time. Now they have a section 8 voucher. The stigma of coming from a shelter hurts but the checks are coming and you have to say you’re from a shelter because they pay the first month’s rent, broker fees and the security so there’s no way of getting around that. When owners and renters hear you’re coming from a shelter, they’re shocked. “Not everyone is a bad apple in shelter. A lot of good, decent people that need some help.” 00:15:08 Janet has teenagers in the Bronx who live with their grandmother. Her family in Pennsylvania doesn’t even know that she’s been in shelter because she chooses not to tell them. It’s not out of embarrassment, it’s just that some things she doesn’t let them know and this is one of them, no matter how hard. Her kids are getting older and asking why they don’t have things like a couch because you’re not allowed that stuff but they will. “This is only temporary, a long temporary, but it’s only temporary. God got a plan for us.” 00:16:04 Janet has met a lot of good people like her friends Glenda and Ricky. There’s people that come and go whom she has stayed in touch with through social media. She’ll shoot a text every six months asking how everything is going. 00:16:38 Janet’s biggest concern at the moment is to get out of here. They have money put aside and they have a good voucher. They have to stay in the city for at least 12 months and then they can leave the city and that feels good. Her family always tells her that she’s so lucky to live in New York City but she just wants to be one of those people, who get on a bus once or twice a year to come visit the city and go right back. *Takes a break at 00:17:49* 00:17:51 Janet’s near future plans are to get an apartment, go back on social security and go back to work. In the past, she has worked as a Bartender, waitress and dental assistant. People who end up in the shelter system aren’t just people who are unemployed or don’t want to work. Its people with jobs, like her friend who works at NYU, another does cleaning or working at ACS, who end up needing some type of housing help since New York City is so expensive. Their voucher for two bedrooms is $1,630, if she goes to Pennsylvania or parts of Jersey, you can get an entire house and still have money to pay your bills. A goal of Janet’s is to rent or have their own home. 00:19:54 Janet looks forward to getting back to regular life after leaving the shelter. Being able to cook, not sign in or out and have your own keys, it’s the little things that mean a lot. 00:20:23 Janet met her husband, Yama, through a friend named Debbie in the Bronx. She thought he was funny. Together they have twins, he respects her other children just like she respects his. 00:21:55 Yama was a having a gathering at his apartment where she had been living at the time. She had hurt her ankle so she went on an ambulance to St. Barnabas Hospital. Yama said he would get rid of everyone and meet her at the hospital. She not only finds out that she’s pregnant, but pregnant with twins and they were both boys. She was almost two months pregnant. Yama ran around the block showing the sonogram. Twins run in her family. It was hard when they were younger, it’s gotten easier at they get older. She was 37 when she got pregnant with the twins and thought her baby days were over since her oldest is 29 years old. 00:24:03 If you have to go through what you have to go through, you can’t get comfortable in Shelter. It has not been easy; you just have to learn to maneuver. Now that she knows about more programs, she wishes she knew them before so she would’ve done things differently. The city doesn’t tell you everything; you have to go through these things. They applied in 2007 for a Section 8 voucher and they still wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t for being in a shelter because they get priority. Get out of New York City, go somewhere cheaper. ",
  "Miller_Gary_timecode.txt": "Gary Miller, who visited the fair when he was 16, gives an in depth description of various pavilions and exhibits in the fair that stood out most to him. He is currently a World’s Fair History and volunteer with the NYS Pavilion Paint Project which helped re-paint the building and hosts events for people to attend. 00:00:21 Describes how the entire experience of attending the World’s Fair was for him. \\ He was about 16 years old and he attended with both family and friends. Attending with friends gave him a sense of freedom. 00:01:16 Describes his favorite pavilions: the corporate pavilions such as Bell Telephone, General Electric, General Motors and Ford, etc. Explains the Coca Cola walk through exhibition in which guests were given a free coke. The Wisconsin pavilion stood out to him most out of all of the international pavilions with the World’s largest cheese on display. Explains that the fair was a place where you could view important paintings from the Spanish Pavilion then walk across the street to see a giant cheese. 00:02:54 Tells us how Robert Moses allowed everyone to do what they wanted with their pavilions. There were lots of rides, exhibitions, etc. Disney had four pavilions with other companies. Explains the Ford exhibition where you rode in a car through a history of dinosaurs all the way to the future. 00:04:57 He’s heard people compare the fair to the Wizard of Oz, it’s a fantasy land. 00:05:45 The IBM pavilion, in the shape of a giant egg, was the most interesting building to him. It had demonstrations of electric typewriters. There were also several exhibits under the giant egg. The most exciting of these was a giant grandstand that brought you into the building and you watched movies on multiple screens. It was entertaining but also related to IBM products. 00:10:08 Two things that everyone took away from the fair: Belgium Waffles, everyone ate them, and the “It’s a Small World” theme song stuck in your head. 00:12:07 The NYS Pavilion had three components: “The Tent of Tomorrow” with the map of New York State, the fiberglass roof no longer exists, the “Thearterama” which included a 360 degree film, and the Observation Towers which were designed to be the tallest at the fair by Governor Rockefeller. Unlike other Pavilions, the building itself, designed by Phillip Johnson, was the main attraction rather than what was in it. 00:14:45 He talks about a volunteer project, The NYS Pavilion Paint Project, that he is part of working on repainting the pavilion. The goal was to have it painted for the anniversary on April 22, 2014 so that guests can come to visit it. Since then they invited people to visit it two more times and would like to continue doing this. Melinda Katz and the Parks Department have also been interested in restoring the Pavilion and Observation Towers. Tells us all of the parts of the pavilion that has been put to other use. 00:21:42 He spoke to a security guard on Queens Colleges campus, she asked about Flushing Meadow, and he informed her that she should visit the World’s Fair relics that still exist.

  "Millus_John_timecode.txt": "When I first settled down in Queens, I knew something was strange. Besides getting accustomed to a new neighborhood, I had to get used to the fact that I might never work again. Dozens of trips to chiropractors, neurologists, heart specialists, a clinical psychologist, lawyers, the Unemployment hearings, the Workers� Comp hearings, Social Security�these were the events that made up my days and weeks and months. It took the place of work, sort of. One might say I was working, so to speak--�working the system.� But more and more it dawned on me that, indeed, here I am, retired�at age forty-eight! A friend, the son of a doctor, used to joke with me, the son of a landlord, that we were the �last of the leisure class.� And looking at all the people scurrying past me to their workplace each day, it seemed as if the enviable transition to that state had come to pass for me. The main problem, until I got adjusted to it, was the enormous amount of time on my hands. I decided that, instead of letting it bother me, I would make like a Buddhist and just---wait. Wait and, more importantly (like Sherlock Holmes), observe. There was no sense to just letting events swirl around me, feeling envious of the able-bodied and employed. I had a little money coming in. I wasn�t starving. So I determined to focus in on the little mundane things that were happening all around me. And this is what the wise will do--authors, poets, painters, saints, i.e., observe, comment, and draw others to see what is going on all the time and all around them. Every minute of the day something, somewhere is always happening. And as the world turns, those little things which people who are busy with their work simply shrug off and take for granted, others, perhaps more enlightened, take for their soul�s inspiration. \"A lot of life,\" the renowned historian and scholar EugenWeber once declared, \"is about things so trivial we do not bother to record them � only sometimes to note their absence, as with manners.\" But here is where the poetry of life lies, and this is how, if I may be so bold, one�s destiny is mastered. God is in the details, so the saying goes. So a good part of my time during the day was turned to watching, as the writer Jane Jacobs so nicely put it, �the ballet of the good city sidewalk...replete with new improvisations.� Rather than hopping and running to fix things, or worse, lamenting that I could neither hop nor run, I began to fix my eyes on Sunnyside, Queens, New York, USA. The time--the mid-nineties. Typical pre-9/11 New York City. Take, for example, an ordinary day in June. I am having my lunch outside the Reformed Church of Sunnyside, located on the corner of Forty-Eighth Street and Skillman Avenue in the borough of Queens. It is perhaps, at least for me (and before the kids get out of school) the most peaceful spot on earth, despite the surrounding pastiche of joyless, overfed, waddling immigrant women, American dreamers, Al Anon kindred spirits and furtive illegal aliens of all stripes and colors. It was worse in the early nineties. The government was easy on them. But here passes, as they say, the millennium mosaic, mine to put together in my head like so many social Leggoes, groaning all the while with an inward despair, but hopeful that this, too--this slow, stealthy deracination of Americans in their sleep--will pass away. Don't fault me for commenting on it as I do. I couldn't change it, anyway. And I wouldn't trade the charm of these two benches for anything, except maybe a dozen free years in Hawaii. On a warm day, they are from heaven. As I say, it was worse. Last year. You could almost hear them laughing on the inside: Stupid gringos, stupid Amerikanskies-- whatever they called us--We're getting this money, that money, buying our kids Power Rangers and every battery-powered toy you could throw at us. Now the Bangladeshi merchant is crying--\"Where are the food stamps? They used to come every day--two hundred dollars from Uncle Sam.\" Instead, nowadays, they just buy milk and cheap ices--but still the beer--always the beer. The world most likely would cease to turn without cervesa fria. Apparently our friend Giuliani, now well into his first term as Mayor of New York City, was making great strides in cutting back on the number of welfare freeloaders. Switch to five in the morning--any morning. Irish lads and lasses kicking around in the darkest hour just before dawn, knocking on the window of the corner pub--just their usual all-night stand, 'cause Irish girls figured out a long time ago that you didn't get with child if you stayed standing up and drinking until the sun rose on a new day. You didn't have to sleep with anyone if you didn't get tired and say, \"I want to go to bed!\" Or maybe they just hypnotically stay up late and drink. I never could figure it out. Even in my teenage days of dating Carol this or Nancy that (Irish girls) I could never figure it out. I guess it was just good to get out of the house, so they stayed out late. They grab their gypsy cabs to who-knows-where, and leave the breaking, bloodshot day to Miguel and Maria, or Zoita and Dinell--whatever their names--on their way to work in the factory. What factory? Any factory. Any sweatshop, any restaurant, any caf�, supermarket, car wash, assembly line, repair shop, whatever--anywhere. Any work or hustle to pay the nine-hundred or so dollars a month the bloodsucker landlords are getting around here for their dump apartments. The illegals get around the high rent by stuffing their space full of friends, relatives and fellow countrymen, where all who can begin breeding �anchor babies� to insure that they can�t be deported and that the city schools have no empty seats or classrooms. I go for a walk--up to Sam the Korean in the twenty-four hour deli-grocery-of-the second-happiness to grab a cup of the best coffee in Queens--the kind you pour yourself with exactly the right amount of milk and sugar (no \"whitener\" and \"sweetener\" for this tough guy!) and, of course, you take a good \"free\" gulp to make sure of everything before you top it off again and clamp down the lid. \"O-ship, o-ship?\" I gargle. Meaning: I want to pay only fifty cents instead of the usual sixty. \"Where you learn Korean?\" Sam wants to know. I tell him the same thing every time: �Hey, this is New York--one hundred and ninety something languages spoken here, one hundred and seventy four in the schools.� Funny, but there are only one hundred and seventy member nations in the U.N. I would just like to find a bit of humorous common ground with this uptight, Asian-mentality Asian. At night Sam is replaced by his obviously overworked teenage daughter, who naps with her head on the counter. Probably good breaking-in for a career in medicine. Someday I'll tell her that I was taking five gulps while she slept. Oh, and �Sam� isn�t short for �Samuel.� It is the Korean word for �three.� I guess he was his father�s third shot at immortality. Manhattan has some great and interesting people, but has no monopoly on them. Matter of fact, everyone is so busy that for the most part, people are hard to know. Dealing with them, in many ways�well, it�s like the old clich� about Chinese food: after half an hour, you�re hungry again. It seemed as though, here in Sunnyside, I was meeting colorful people with interesting stories almost at every turn. For example, take Mr. Singh. One couldn�t miss him in a crowd, since he is a turban-wearing Sikh, or Surdarji. Sure, you'd like to pronounce the word as \"seek\", but, I'm sorry, it is \"sickh.\" To a sub-continental, he is, as I say, a Surd, or \"Surdarji,\" using the diminutive �ji� ending, which connotes respect. The Sikhs are the fighting men, heavy equipment operators and industrialists of India, but to the generally short and slender Hindus--the main body of Indians--they are their equivalent of our Polacks, with concomitant deprecatory anecdotes and humor. Although he does have some medical problems that give us conversational common ground, Mr. Singh is quite healthy, actually. \"Imperially slim\", as they say. Very spry and lively for a gentleman in his eighties. Still walks with a sprightly, military step. He owes it, he says, to playing a lot of field hockey in his youth. He is well-known throughout the neighborhood, loved and respected. Ex-Indian Air Force, he has, I find by rather blunt questioning, fifteen \"kills\" to his credit. And it is always fascinating to hear his early aviation and down-to-earth war stories. I always regret not prompting him for more tales, since his air warrior career spanned aviation�in both British and independent India--almost from its birth right up and into the modern jet age. He did some real flying and real killing, and some miraculous dodging of death, from what I did manage to gather. Eventually, however, death did come, at home and in bed, and I as well as others in the neighborhood often miss and speak of the old soldier. Mr. Singh had also, I might add, a great interest in the Indian art of reading palms, and I learned I would have been dead, which I know, from some event in the last few years--only I have survived, thank goodness, based on some other, needless to say, fortunate line. Apparently, the key to India's success in their war with neighboring Pakistan in the sixties was bombing, on day one of the war, the building where slept all the best enemy pilots. Their eggs in one basket, the rest was academic. India won. But today I am hearing about the poor gentleman�s latest medical adventure. After laser surgery two years ago restored impaired vision, he has just recently been operated on for a detached retina. I sympathize, now knowing I should take lots of Occuvites (eye vitamins) and pray. He is indebted to publishers of large-print books, which he reads endlessly. But within months, he is driving again, trading in his Jaguar for an Audi. The main thing I learn today, however, is the story of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. Apparently, after the invasion of India by the Moslem warrior-king Babur, wholesale \"ethnic cleansing\" of Hindus took place. Not just for a few days or weeks, but to such an extent that their society was and continues to be totally disjointed and demoralized--backwards. That is why much of their inner cities still look like something from the Middle Ages. I heard of their Brahmin class being decimated in the degree that the light cotton thread--actually a string--which they earned and wore as a sign of their advanced status, was taken from them as they were killed. All these threads were amassed and weighed and the killers paid by the pound. It seems that hundreds of thousands of pounds thus represented the extent of Brahmin genocide. All this around the time of Columbus. Perhaps old Chris was lucky that he didn't find a way to India. He would have walked in on a slaughter! Anyway, Guru Nanak was determined to bring about peace and reconciliation, having been freed by Babur when a grinding wheel, to which he had been assigned to work in prison, miraculously turned around and around by itself. Everyone recognized that he was a great holy man. He roamed the earth in travels that formed the shape of a cross from east to west and south to north, learning about the ways of all the inhabitants. One particularly famous story was set in Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, where the guru fell asleep with his feet pointing to the sacred rock of the Moslems. One clergyman came and kicked him viciously, admonishing him not to point his feet toward God. His reply, most gentle and polite, was a request for the priest kindly to pick up his feet and \"point them to where God is not.\" As the Moslem turned him in this direction and that, every time he looked, the feet were pointing at the sacred stone, as if the central symbol of Islamic belief were following the holy vibrations emanating from the limbs of the guru. In this way and many others, Nanak made his reputation and today the Sikhs worship the sacred words of the sage contained in a large book, the Granit Sahib, which is opened every morning and actually put to bed each night in the Sikh temples around the world. Mr. Singh tried once, he told me, to join the social circle of the church in front of which we sat. But with his turban and beard, he related to me how he had felt rebuffed. However, his feelings must have been noted somehow, because the elders suggested that he conduct a tour of his Temple for the benefit of the Church's adolescent Bible class. They were told the history of the Sikh religion and fed traditional (vegetarian) Punjabi food. It must have been an interesting adventure for them, being as American, meat-eating and middle class as you can get. (But, then again, outside the temple, most Sikhs are non-vegetarian.) I myself was in India in 1969 and am still not sure I have recovered from the cultural shock. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the hottest summer I ever spent was a winter in New Delhi. Like Twain, I watched an Indian woman attempt to beat a rock smooth with my undershirts. After she was done, the neat parcel in a brown bag was nearly devoured by a cow as I sat sipping tea in a bazaar. Bizarre. The list is endless--the deadly poisonous lizard that shared my quarters and snacked on mosquitoes, thus protecting me from malaria; the scorpions that had a shoe fetish, making me very careful in the morning--or why Indians wear sandals. The cops that rousted me for suspicion of gold smuggling when what I actually smuggled was hard-boiled eggs into a controlled \"strict vegetarian area,\" the region around the ashrams of Rishikesh and Haridwar. To me they were gold, for after a week of finding over-octaned chili in everything, I was a man dealing with starvation. But the fasting was good for meditation, which I was studying with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The hungrier you were, up to a point, the easier and clearer was the \"going within\" experience. And, of course, meat is a killer of meditation, or even of focusing on God. But that's another story. You're born in the West, you eat meat. You didn't have any choice about it as a child, and then it's a habit when you grow up. Yes, they have a nice term for it now--cultural shock--but India has always worked in mysterious ways. What would New York, or for that matter, the United States, be like if everyone said-- instead of �Hey, howsit goin'?\"--this: \"Your soul and mine are one!\"? That's the translation of Namaste, the most common daily greeting among Hindus on the sub-continent. Or how about \"Divine Peace be with you!\"--Salaam Aleichem!--which the Moslems use? But I guess cows would start wandering around in the streets if that happened. Hey, would that be so bad? Cows, instead of homeless and illegals! A nasty case of hepatitis infected me when I returned from my world travels in 1969. I was weak as a proverbial kitten for about two years afterward and, indeed, almost lost the will to live. Vitamin shots, plus B vitamin capsules, plus the tincture of time�these were the only treatments. Only gradually did my strength return, and never to the same level as before. I could work hard, but not long. Hepatitis is a horrible disease, probably brought on by absent-mindedly drinking tap water somewhere in Asia or the Middle East. Raw clams in Sheepshead Bay might also have done the deed. Or combinations of both, plus lousy food in foreign restaurants. I paid a steep price for world travel in the sixties and seventies. Otherwise, I would be inclined to wax more lyrical and rhapsodic about foreign lands and cultures. However, as it is, I say, �God bless America!� Kindly repeat this phrase daily and tell friends to do likewise. More Sunnyside local color, if I may: There's a grocery-deli across Skillman Avenue, run by a fellow named Ata (pronounced AH-tah) and his tiny Korean wife, Chun (which in her language means �one thousand�). I�m always welcome to come in and �set a spell�, and I often do, especially if the weather is bad. Ata is a good storekeeper, storyteller, source of credit in a pinch, and for me, being at that time on Social Security Disability, that pinch ran generally from the fifteenth of the month to the third of the next. That's when my meditation was good. The place is the Queens equivalent of the southern or Midwestern general store, the cracker barrel supplanted by racks of potato chips, cheese doodles and Drake's cake. Mornings are meeting time for a more or less regular coterie, whom I call �the gang,� �the Sultans,\" or �the usual suspects.\" Others refer to them as the \"Skillman Mafia\". They're guys who happen to have, at least in the morning, some of that rare luxury of today--namely, time. Time, at least, to linger over coffee and a donut or buttered roll, talking mostly about money, politics, women, or whatever, making lame jokes and trying to set the world right before their daily routine takes them hither and yon. They are generally self-employed storekeepers, contractors, limo drivers and landlords, strong men with a natural conservative bent--the Sultans of Sunnyside, as it were. Some are Romanian; some are Lebanese, others Pakistani. Marcello�Mark-- and his energetic father are �migr�s from Italy. The father, old Joe, is worth about five million in cash and real estate, but he still dresses and looks like a struggling storekeeper, and is there every morning at nine o'clock, rain or shine, to open his grocery store. A poster child for the European work ethic, he wouldn't know what to do if there wasn't work. These are some of the more outgoing players in this human drama, and I mention them to distinguish them from the anonymous, less colorful folk who wander in all day and night, who actually are the backbone of Ata's business. I see hundreds of them going in and out over time. What Americans there are, that is, those whom Ata would call \"your people\" or, as I have come to call them, \"indigenites\"--usually have little to say. The Spanish less; though, of course, among their own, they are voluble enough for twenty. I can't see how anyone, living in a foreign country for more than a year, can't pick up the rudiments of pleasantries in that time. They seem to be these rather tightly wound balls of suspicion and insularity. This is a pity, since they're pretty jolly and ready with a joke and a laugh when they're in their own element. They can't depart from their Spanish culture, at least not right away, but their mere presence here begs the question--what the heck good is the society from which they came? But, almost to a man, or woman, they would rather create their own little Santo Domingo or Guatemala or Mexico and live in it here, wishing the gringo (American) or blanco (Whitey)--or anyone else for that matter--something less than good. I recalled a line from my friend Morris Fitzpatrick�s excellent unpublished work, Coming to Naught in America��No zoo in the world would put all the animals in one cage, but in Queens, they do.� However, the drill is: enter, say nothing, walk to the cooler, get the beer or milk or soda, name the cigarettes, pay, and walk out. Hopefully there are no INS (now ICE) personnel to put an end to the artful dodge. So they remain illegal worker bees, drones, for the most part. Very few will joke or banter with the owner. It's not a question of command of the language. It's a matter of personality and character. Or lack thereof. Or maybe of royal blood. Or the plain fact that they are here illegally and know it�there�s just no happy, secure feeling coming from deep within. They are not of us. They are fleeing sorrow but have not yet found joy. They have, and are, a problem. Those that have a modicum of life in them stand out like a sore thumb. They are contributors. The others could be throwaways, extras in the great cinema v�rit� of life, cardboard caricatures of real people: colorless, monotonous, uninteresting--just what Madison Avenue and all the high-powered consultants call them--consumers. Ata makes fun of the people from his own part of the world, the Hindu and Moslem Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, the ones who only buy milk. And if they can save four cents on a gallon they'll walk ten blocks out of their way in the rain to do it. But they do amazing things with milk, and, of course, rice. That's all the food they care about. I can understand it, however. It took my Armenian girlfriend ten years in this country to break down and try Cheerios for breakfast. Her twin sister explained: \"If you put gun to my head I vood not eat. Only my children got me to try because dey raised here. Now vee like!\" Yeah, but it's like pulling teeth to find a glass of milk or an American newspaper in their house. And definitely forget about what Americans call bread, the fluffy, sliced white stuff from aisle three in the supermarket. They'll shop at a Turkish store�the people that massacred millions of their fellow Armenians-- for their familiar round loaf any day before they'll stock up on Grossinger's Rye or Wonder bread. Revealing this and similar observations to Mr. Singh resulted in his explaining that his people were commissioned to be tolerant, to recognize God as being everywhere, and to be aware of the danger of claiming a corner on that market, so to speak. \"One is taught to be as tolerant as a tree, and lower than the straw in the street,\" he would tell me. God is in everyone's heart, I conclude, though someone else is definitely in their heads. I had many conversations with the elderly gentleman, and we shared a love of telling each other tales as much as we enjoyed the good fortune of great weather, whenever we chanced to experience it. And of course the happy comfort of those benches in front of the church on a warm and sunny Skillman Avenue afternoon. The two of us were in the same boat, in some respects, both of us with time on our hands. He too old to work, I disabled and barely up to the challenge of climbing stairs or walking a few blocks without incurring chest pains that won't easily go away. We have a common problem--the problem of what in blazes to do all day. Oh, of course, the time passes. He does volunteer work at his Temple, chiefly making sure that the donations get counted properly and put in the bank. I make the rounds of several small businesses in the neighborhood, stop in and chat with the owners about my stocks and theirs, check the market, peek at my portfolio on the Internet, read the New York Times and maybe the Post. My brain and my cameras didn�t sit idle during this time. I discovered I could contribute to the neighborhood by focusing on the little things I found wrong, shooting some pictures, and sending them around to the local papers and the offices of our local officials. A little storefront graffiti here, a little dead tree about to come down on someone there, perhaps some illegal dumping or a pothole or sinkhole ready to swallow a car or person�anything I found that was grossly out of order. Bringing it to people�s attention and getting it fixed earned me something of a reputation as a civic-minded �neighborhood guy.� After helping some people out with unjust parking or Sanitation tickets, translating and explaining notices from the City and the Social Security Administration, the Workers� Compensation Board, etc., I was being called �the Mayor of Skillman Avenue.� So now I was a legitimate local �fixer,� giving back to society, not just getting. Not a bad way to be, considering. I also started a little work of glitzy prose and doggerel I�d taken to calling �Song of Long Island,� which I hoped would bring in some income. It was an offshoot of my little tourist guide to the outer boroughs and on eastward. Aimed at enticing well-educated young people away from Manhattan and encouraging them to respect the hinterland�s so-called �bedroom communities,� I thought it could possibly improve the quality of life all around. Again, a little social activism�something new to me. The increasingly steep rents, competition for space and the quality thereof, however, I found were doing the job for me in moving people to repopulate unsung areas like Woodside and Sunnyside, my grand new neighborhoods, along with Astoria, Jackson Heights, and other areas. Even Long Island City, with its un-hip, unglamorous factory-district association, was becoming a sort of snob haven, now that certain waterfront residence projects are coming online. As I say, time passed. And all the while there were the legal battles in my head and in the various hearing rooms and courts, and while I could do very well without them, they gave some purpose and cohesion to my life. But it's a strange groove to one who has always worked hard and kept busy, and taken physical and mental health for granted. Russell Baker once said that old age isn't for sissies. Neither is disability. Living with it, is, essentially, the art of doing either not much or nothing, while still being a neighbor, friend, boyfriend, citizen and member of society. When every day is like Sunday or a day off, there's little to distinguish one parcel of time from the rest. I remembered a passage from Jack London�s Call of the Wild, describing sled dogs in the Yukon: �There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre, every cell, was tired, dead tired.� I liked to start most days by turning over on my side and going back to sleep--until noon. Ordinarily, I would feel sort of guilty about this, but I say, no: this little statement distinguishes me from the birds and animals, and working folks, who have to get up. Anyway, e-commerce was here--maybe that would be my best hope of getting off welfare. And God bless working folks. By no means am I putting them down. Where would I be without them? I used to write songs, staying up long into the night, when a combination of solitude and the quiet night's natural \"creative window\" allowed for meaningful expression. I actually used to leap out of bed at odd hours, eager to pounce on an inspiration or perceived melody that came with sleep and dreams. But I couldn't look at a guitar or piano after my run-in with management. I was deeply, deeply depressed. To be turned off to song writing is truly to be pissed, and I am now thoroughly amazed at that feeling's pervasiveness and power in the dampening of the spirit and mind. It is something I never could conceive of ever happening. To this day I find it difficult to pick up a guitar. It is almost repellent to think of singing. I don't know what could have hurt me so bad as to bring about such a state. What am I getting at? Well, perhaps this is all to say that you can�t understand disability until you yourself are disabled. This is the conclusion President Clinton came to when he injured his knee in a fall. It is the one thing I admire about the man, aside from his obvious charm and political savvy. He really did feel my pain. Anyway, you don't have to be a member of daytime society to accomplish things in life. How many times I pitied the poor sleeper as I emerged from a creative night and greeted the dawn with a new, exciting musical composition. It was the same in college with a late typing and final editing of a good term paper. Many things are like that--poetry, books, art, lifesaving surgery, winning law briefs. Lotsa stuff. Of course, now people are realizing that the speed and pace of New York�nay, the whole of Western society--are not really good for you. Likewise with irregular sleeping patterns. However, social and economic inertia dictates to everyone that they can't slow down. So folks try to get their relaxation on the fly, by running or hitting the gym. The other point I�d like to make is this: you don't know how tired you are until you lose your job. I've talked to people who have literally spent five years sleeping off the stress, and only gradually come out of it after then. And some give up hope forever, just wishing to die. Man has to be connected, and work is the big connection. If these sound like the opening lines of the first chapter of �Early Retirement for Dummies,� then so be it. They may be my only contribution to the body of work now surrounding this and other related social and health issues. But an important issue it is. If my experience and comments keep one laid-off or injured worker from harming or killing himself or herself, then I have done my duty. Society is good here in the United States. We have all kinds of safety nets�as well we should have. In other countries, if relatives don't step in, people literally starve to death by the side of the road if they don't earn. But I digress from my little portrait of Sunnyside. After lunch, it's time to walk it off and walk around. That usually means up to \"The Boulevard\". If Queens Boulevard were in Paris, the people who spend their time wandering about as I and many others do would be charitably referred to as boulevardiers. I imagine that class came about and evolved from the ranks of wounded veterans of France�s many wars, living on their pensions and allowances, content to simply stroll the boulevards, park their tired frames in an outdoor cafe, sip some vin ordinaire and check out the passing throng. But here they are simply the borderline loafers, misfits, crackpots, ne�er-do-wells and oddballs that make up the non-workaday world of this part of the borough. In a word, social refuse. Blind Bartimaeus would have felt right at home here among these Barnum and Bailey sideshow rejects, as someone once called them. If they have net spendable, they can be found in the vicinity of the betting parlor, OTB (for Off Track Betting)--or �Old Turf Bums�, depending on your perspective. Otherwise, they people the donut dens and small coffee shops that dot the area, or the small park wedged into the whizzing traffic lanes that, depending on which way you are facing, east or west, either jettison the sizzling traffic from the city out toward Forest Hills and Jamaica, or slow it down on its way to the Fifty-Ninth Street Bridge and Mad-hattan. Either way, if you survive getting across the lanes safely--and it�s not nicknamed the �Boulevard of Death� for nothing--there isn't much haven there. Usually its denizens are soft-core homeless--that is, the kind that aren't totally and hopelessly repugnant. But you do have to be prepared for the real wastrels, like the guy down the way who suddenly gets up and urinates on a tree. Some are just tired seniors, lucky that they can still walk somewhere. They may get a Social Security check, but if they're hanging out here, they are definitely indigent or near-indigent. Add a liberal mix of Mexican or Central American day laborers who couldn't connect with a contractor, sprinkle in some forlorn Pakis and homesick Bangladeshis and Hindus and you've got the basic picture. There are a few concrete chess tables, but I doubt anyone has ever enjoyed a game thereon since they were cemented there by some well-meaning city agency thirty or so years ago. The benches are usually spattered with starling and pigeon dung, attesting to the lack of trees in other areas and the overabundance of un-neighborly slobs (or St. Francis-like saints, again, depending upon your perspective) that spend their money on birdseed and bread to feed these loathsome species. The rat population is grateful, but not I or the people disgusted by the mess. The hordes of pigeons waiting for their free food are a metaphor of this once-quiet, now overcrowded place, crammed with illegals just soaking up the American wages, the �benefits,� and who go on littering the streets, bringing down the neighborhood and fattening the landlords. Their overall giveback to society is pretty well mirrored in the trash and filth and graffiti which the city labors to eradicate, mostly in vain. Today a female junkie stops at one nearby bench, and I don't wait for her next act, which is usually pulling down her pants and pissing like a mud-stained mule. While we�re on the subject of animals, human and regular, as well as bodily functions, let me talk about dogs here. The dog-owners make a doggie bathroom of the shady and leafy sidewalks of Sunnyside Gardens, actually one of the nicest neighborhoods in which I've lived. It's a \"concept\" development from the twenties, based on an English model, with plenty of courtyards and trees and grass. Most people take pride in their lovely gardens and keep up their property. But the stench and sight of dog waste attacking your nostrils and stomach and eyes even after a soaking, twenty-four hour July rain that otherwise clears the air makes you wonder: \"What kind of people are these?\" The representatives of ancient cultures that people Sunnyside often ask me the same basic question: How does this American culture expect to last at the rate it's going? I always dodge by awing them when I tell them of my ancient times, back in the fifties, usually 'way before they came, when everything was sweetness and light. I confess hamming up my role with a certain pathos and reverential, nostalgic tone, but it gets them every time. \"Candy bars five cents? Gasoline thirty cents?\", they ask disbelievingly. Yes, I nod, sadly and sagely. \"And telephone five cents. And subway five cents. And newspaper five cents.\" Their jaws drop. Always one of them will gasp. (Until they realize that things, wages and prices, are still pretty much the same--just multiplied by ten.) \"And no gates on stores--and no one lock door.\" I lapse into immigrant-speak. Then Ata, the deli owner and coffee-pouring moderator of our meetings, always the comedian and himself Pakistani, (albeit an atypical example) will say, \"And then come Pakistani and all prices go up and everyone stealing!\" After which, Valentin, the Romanian, will add, \"Then Romanian hear and push Communist government--look, let us go. Then we steal, too, and bring back! So, no more Iron Curtain.\" \"Yes,\" Avik the Armenian will add. \"Vee go steal American kitchen curtain!\" \"Yes,\" I say, to top the laughs, with appropriate arm gestures, \"Nineteen fifty-nine al-l-l locksmith, all security business tell U.S. Government: 'Bring Pakistani, yes, bring all devious crud--make work for us, make job--all steel gate and lock, alarm install!�� And the whole deli-grocery would howl and we'd spill our coffee. In essence, I tell them that the real America was gone before they stepped off the plane. But there were better times--at least less frenzied, less rude, more peaceful and enjoyable ones. Back when. Just for fun, let me take you there. ",

  "Mobarak_Sami_timecode.txt": "My name is Sami Mobarak, originally I�m from Alexandria, Egypt. I�ve been in the neighborhood for 26 years. I live just two blocks from here in 28th Avenue. I had a pizzeria for almost 8 years. Me and my wife enjoyed going around in the weekends to flea markets and stuff, and to buy antiques. And we turned a hobby into a business. Not too long ago, about a year ago. It has turned out nice. You do something that you like to do and at the same time you make some money, so that cannot be bad. I have a friend who has a huge store, like 25,000 square. And every now and then like on a monthly basis he sends me a truck. And besides that I go to a few flea markets and yard sales. Like in Bricktown New Jersey I was there yesterday and I buy things. Trying to have a reasonable price where I keep the customer happy. It�s just making a living, it�s not like a huge profit, just a living. The revolution in Egypt: it was about time. It should have happened a long time ago. I think when the time comes the time comes. I hope that the new revolution will bring some sort of stability in the country because it was like a boiling pot, with big time poverty. I was visiting six months before the revolution and I saw people eating from the garbage and I saw people spending tons of money. It was like there was no in-between. The split in society between the filthy rich or dirty poor. You cannot just keep going like this. What happened was a wake-up call for everybody who lives there. Myself as an Egyptian who lives outside Egypt I was pretty much emotionally involved and trying to find any way to support. So we have a singer here and we got together and made a song for the revolution � we were the chorus team behind. I remember when there was a 1 bedroom apartment here for 375 or 400 dollars and now we are talking about 1400 for a one bedroom studio. Also the skin of Astoria has changed because it was dominated by Greek. Now it�s become a melting pot � you see all kinds of different people who live all together. I think it�s one of the most safest and beautiful places in New York City that you can live. Mostly in my mind I put my customers in different groups. Some they are really interested in antiques and they are willing to pay good money for it, but that is not so many people. And mostly people are looking for cheaper stuff. So I am focused on having a little bit to satisfy everybody�s taste in different products. But mostly I work with silver which is a big thing and I sell a lot of ladies jewelry. I see a lot of movement from Manhattan to Astoria, because only 10 to 15 minutes you are in the heart of the city but when you compare the rent in the city and the rent here, it�s still cheaper so you see most of those middle class working couples they move to the neighborhood. And to accommodate this new neighborhood movement they open a lot of caf�s which didn�t exist before, it was like small stores here and there. Now there�s heavy investment, like some of those new cafes cost maybe a million or so. And they are doing a great business, and attract more crowds, and I think that�s why the rents here have never gone down. They still hold even though the real estate has been busted and the rent went down almost everywhere else. Again, the 114 precinct is one of the best police stations, they are always present, always there. Young ladies who get off work at 3, 4 o�clock in the morning and are walking home by themselves they feel safe and don�t have any problem. And being here for a long time creates some kind of like a whole big family lives in the neighborhood, everybody looking after everybody. If it�s late and I see some weird-looking person walking by or something I just make sure everything is ok. So I think everybody does his part. And after all these years I think also that people start to trust each other. Like you get Turkish a close friends with the Greeks, or an Egyptian has an Israeli as one of his best friends, and it becomes like you forget about what is the foreign policies and politics and all these big things and you just go down to a person, to human beings that need a living. [Info. missing from recording. Wife is from Algeria, two sons. Twice he tried to move to New Jersey but both times came back. Misses the neighborhood, and the fact it stays open 24 hours � there is always activity � other places felt dead in comparison] The place I took over was already a pizza store and I thought might was well keep it as a pizza store, the old customers will keep coming. It was good. I worked there, I burned myself left and right with the oven, and yeah, getting older now I felt that I need something quieter. When the oven is too hot and you�re sweating and tired. So I guess my age � I�m 53 years old, I decided it�s time to calm down a little bit and have something more relaxing. ",

First he lived in Queens, moved to Brooklyn, and then back to Queens - settling in South Ozone Park. Antonio and his family were middle class. As a child he loved listening to different genres of music and was interested in photography. Young Antonio made pocket money by having parties in his basement, and later at the park [edit: add park name if known].

He also talks about his family move between the Queens and Brooklyn. 00:03:39 Antonio talks about coming back to Queens and the differences between the living in South Jamaica Queens and Brooklyn - for example living in South Jamaica Queens was similar to the south because they had houses. 00:04:20 Antonio talks about his family being the third black families to move in South Ozone.

  "Moorhead_Dorothy_timecode.txt": "“We are an extremely stable community. If you want a quiet, clean environment and nature around you, you can’t beat Sunnyside.” To name all the organizations and communal activities Dorothy Morehead has been a part of over the course of the last decades would take up much of the day. Most notably, Dorothy is a real estate agent serving Sunnyside Gardens and has been active in the preservation and beautification of the historic district since she moved to the neighborhood more than 40 years ago. “We are an extremely stable community,” Dorothy says. “If you want a quiet, clean [environment] and nature around you, you can’t beat Sunnyside. It’s wonderful here.”I spoke to Dorothy in the living room of her picturesque two-story brick house on 46th Street, which faces one of the large green center courts Sunnyside Gardens is known for. Designed after the English Garden concept, Sunnyside Gardens is known among architects and urban developers around the world. It was built between the years 1924 and 1930 for families with low and medium incomes who wanted to live close to city. After a long, contentious debate, the community was landmarked in 2007. Dorothy regrets that some residents don’t appreciate Sunnyside Gardens for what it is. Before landmarking took effect, some homeowners covered their yards with driveways and parking lots, put up chain-link fences and built extravagant annexes that clashed with the buildings’ original, down-to-earth style. The landmark opposition maintains that the strict stipulations for window and roof replacement, for example, make homeownership impossible for people with low incomes. In the podcast Dorothy talks about her various achievements within the community and her opinion in regards to Sunnyside Garden’s landmarking. ",
  "Moran_John_timecode.txt": "John Moran was born in 1944 in New York City. He was raised in the Parkchester section of the Bronx and moved to Briarwood, Queens in 1969. He moved to Jackson Heights in the early 1980’s and has lived in the same apartment ever since. John was active in various LGBT organizations in Queens, including Dignity Queens, QCLUE, Queens Pride, and the Lesbian & Gay Democratic Club of Queens. He was also involved in Queens organizations, including the Jackson Heights Beautification Group and Community Board 3. John currently attends events at the Queens Center for Gay Seniors and is a tutor at an Astoria housing project. He can’t believe the progress gays have made in terms of equal rights during this life time. John believes that gay people are just another group in the “potpourri of nationalities, different religions and ages” that make up Jackson Heights. 00:00:00 John Moran was interviewed at the Jackson Heights Branch of the Queens Public Library, located at 3551 81st Avenue, Jackson Heights, on January 29, 2018 at 1:40 PM. 00:00:43 John was born in 1944 in New York City and his mother was born in New York City. His father was born in Ireland. 00:00:50 John’s father was the youngest of three brothers and one sister. His paternal grandfather committed suicide when his paternal grandmother was pregnant with his father. Two of his father’s older brothers were active in the IRA (Irish Republican Army). They were jailed, but escaped to Canada. One uncle (James) eventually settled in New York City and the other brother (Peter) settled in Boston. John’s father told John he had come to the U.S. twice, but went back to Ireland because there was no work. This was during the depression. His father ultimately got a job in NY, in the post office, and always worked there. 00:02:43 John’s parents were married in 1943. John was born in St. Claire’s Hospital in Manhattan. The hospital does not exist anymore. John grew up in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. 00:03:17 In 1969, John moved to Briarwood, Queens. He knew he was gay, but was hoping he could marry a woman. John knew if he stayed home, he would not do anything about his life. That motivated him to get this own apartment. He lived in Briarwood until the early 1980’s and then bought an apartment in Jackson Heights. 00:04:08 The Briarwood apartment was fine. Prior to the migrations of immigrants, Briarwood was basically composed of people of European origins. John did not really set up any roots there. His mother would still launder his shirts when he went to the family’s home for dinner! He just slept there. The neighborhood was made up of Irish, Italians, and Jews. 00:05:24 In 1965, John received his bachelor’s degree - he was studying to be a priest. He left the seminary after graduation. He feared he would ‘go crazy’ at the Novitiate because he would not be able to avoid thoughts about his sexuality. There would be no classes with exams, etc. to take his mind off the terrible condition he had; homosexuality. He felt he was damaged goods of a particularly loathsome nature. The following year would be a religious year and he could not do that. He lived for four years with his family in the Bronx. Then he moved to Briarwood. 00:07:08 When John lived in in Briarwood, he became aware of gay Catholic organizations in Queens. One was called Dignity Queens, which originated in San Francisco. A neighbor was a member. 00:08:38 John lived with his parents until 1969 and came out around this time. There were gay bars in Jackson Heights then. A gay friend from Dignity Queens (was married to a woman at the time), Richard (Dick) Oppels, lived in Jackson Heights. It was a fluke of luck that he went to Jackson Heights and found the building he still lives in (3530 73rd Street Apartment 5H). The building was being converted to cooperatives and the tenants were fighting it. John had a choice of five apartments. His best friend from high school, who is also gay, recommended that John get an apartment in the back of the building, because the traffic on 73rd Street was horrendous at that time. That has passed. John is still living in the same apartment, since the early 1980’s. 00:11:43 People started an organization called QGLU (Queens Gay and Lesbians United). Ed Sedarbaum was the prime mover of the organization. An issue arose in Danny Dromm’s school. He had come out publicly as a public-school teacher. John could not remember the exact issue. Danny (Dromm) came to QGLU. It was reported in the papers that he was gay. (This was in the early 1980’s). Danny (Dromm) decided to come out over the issue and he became involved in the gay community. 00:14:14 The issue was connected to an ‘old Irish grandmother type’ who was very anti-gay. The upshot was that Danny Dromm was integrated into the gay system and he started various organizations. 00:14:41 Jackson Heights is very different now from what is was in the 1980’s. It was Irish and Jewish at the time. John then talked about housing exclusion in Parkchester, where he grew up. Parkchester was built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (opened in 1940). He learned that Jewish people were also excluded. Metropolitan Life Insurance stopped the practice because of the threat of a law suit. 00:16:56 John mentioned that being gay in Jackson Heights, in the 1980’s, was something you wanted to be surreptitious about. There were gays bars on Roosevelt Avenue. You had no sense that there was a large contingent of gay people living in Jackson Heights. Danny Dromm was agitating for more than a year for a gay parade. It was very exciting the morning of the first parade, but John was wondering what would happen when the neighbors found out he was gay. He was not really afraid, just curious what would happen. It turned out the parade was a success. John remembers young women with babies watching the parade. 00:18:10 Today, gay people are just another group in this potpourri of nationalities, different religions and ages. . 00:20:40 John had already been involved in QGLUE. Danny Dromm came to QCLUE. There was a meeting in Queens Borough Hall. The upshot was that Danny (Dromm) had come out as a gay teacher agitating for equal rights. Danny (Dromm) grew up in Jackson Heights and came out when he was an older teenager. Danny (Dromm) was an alcoholic and got his life together. 00:22:03 John was a general member of Queens Pride. He was not a member of any sub committees. 00:22:33 John retired from teaching Spanish on Long Island in the late 1980’s. He went to Law School at night and received a law degree. He got a job with the New York City Department of Corrections. A classmate from the seminary helped him get the job. There were a number of reunions of the seminary class and he mentioned at one of the reunions that he was looking for a job. A few years later, he gave one of the classmates a call – and this classmate asked if he still needed a job and to come for an interview. (We talk more about John’s career later in the interview.) 00:24:12 John was a member of the Lesbian and Gay Queens Club (Club). Danny Dromm also founded this Club. Danny (Dromm) asked John to be president and he was president for two to three years. John thought it was a good experience, but stepped down. He could not recall exactly why he stepped down. 00:25:38 This was the time that Danny Dromm established Winter Pride. The 25th anniversary of Winter Pride was celebrated last year. The event started as a banquet in a banquet hall a few blocks north of Northern Blvd. It occurred there for five years. The event grew and went to Bruno’s on Northern Blvd and (around) 100th Street. Now it is at the Astoria World Manor. The event has grown tremendously. Very few politicians attended Winter Pride in the beginning. Only the courageous and gay-respecting politicians came. These politicians deserve thanks, they started the ball rolling. 00:27:12 John got tired of the event. The cocktail hour is wonderful. Then you go into main hall and the politicians start talking! (A lot of politicians attend the event now.) Now that John is part of the senior generation, he does not even know who these politicians are. It was very touching at the event last month. Danny Dromm’s mother died and there was a major recognition of that. Danny (Dromm) spoke to the group. John reflected on the fact that the gay community is established. John says every year that he won’t go again, but he will go every year! 00:29:38 John hardly ever attends the Lesbian and Gay Queens Democratic Club meetings any more. Danny Dromm also started the New Visions Club, which is a democratic club for the general population. 00:30:17 The New Visions Club is a general political club. The president is from India or a neighboring country. It is another organization that Danny (Dromm) formed before he was a Councilmember. John does not regularly attend the meetings. 00:31:04 John is doing volunteer work tutoring children in an Astoria Housing Project which is in a very high crime area. One of the people on the agenda at New Visions was a man working with those kids, so John wanted to hear him speak. There was an incident about a month ago where a 16-year-old killed another 16-year-old (in the Bronx). The speaker has a program that is trying to save these kids. That attracted John to the meeting, but he generally does not go. 00:32:31 Dignity Queens ended about 10 years ago, but John is still a member of Dignity Manhattan. He does not go to the meetings any more. They have an annual dinner, which John attends. 00:33:04 John participated in the Manhattan gay political clubs. He does not see any differences with the Queens clubs. In Queens, you would expect people to be closeted, but that has changed. It is the same feel in both places. There is a whole new generation of politicians in Manhattan that John doesn’t know. Stonewall Democratic Club was one of the political clubs John attended. 00:34:39 John was a member of Queens Community Board 3. It was very frustrating. John mentioned that in the first year of living in his Jackson Heights apartment, it was burglarized. (We talk about Community Board 3 later in the interview.) 00:35:25 The Jackson Heights Beautification Group was the group most responsible for John getting involved in activities outside the gay community. It was very vibrant and is still around. Every Saturday, the group cleans the streets in Jackson Heights; they organize many events. One of the prime movers is a real estate agent who has a job in the neighborhood. John left the organization because of a particular person who took a dislike to John and John was not sure why. John was on the board and then quit. But he thinks the group does a tremendous amount of good; they have a newsletter and do projects throughout the year. They are an asset to the neighborhood. 00:37:28 John went from the Beautification Group to Community Board 3. That turned out to be a disappointment and frustration. The people not at the top did not have much input into the discussion. 00:37:55 John described a burglary in his building in the 1980’s. This was the only time he has had a problem like that. Over time, John has not thought about the incident. 00:39:57 Community Board 3 issues included traffic, congestion, and noise. This was about 25 years ago when Danny Dromm founded the gay pride parade. When John talked about issues, the Board members would not respond. John participated for many years. He mentioned that it is good being involved in the community and knowing what is going on. 00:41:02 When Danny Dromm was around, John was energized. That has continued and now Danny (Dromm) is in his third term. No other gay leaders stand out for John as influential in his gay activism. 00:42:23 Living conditions are an important issue for John in terms of being an activist. The gay issue – it started with being worried about someone overhearing you talk about the gay community - to the way things are today. John still can’t believe, and never imagined, gay marriage. He would have been happy with equal rights and not being discriminated against. He would never have believed there would be gay marriage. 00:43:12 The AIDS crisis was an issue being dealt with by the gay democratic clubs. Whatever the clubs were doing around AIDS, it did not come up in the neighborhood. John mentioned that two young, gay, Hispanic men were murdered in Jackson Heights at the time. (Julio Rivera was murdered in Jackson Heights.) The rest was day to day, making the gay presence known. There were AIDS organizations, but John was not sure if any organizations in Queens or Jackson Heights were founded on the AIDS issue. John talked about having only two or three good friends in your lifetime - AIDS did not affect the people close to him. John recalled, Tom Darrah, a priest who left the priesthood and came down with AIDS. This happened about 25 years ago. 00:45:38 John could not think of any specific Club activities related to AIDS. Most of the AIDS activities were centered in Manhattan. John does not remember that the Club did a lot about it. People were still afraid to come out at that time. 00:46:32 John left the seminary because the next year would be a spiritual year and he could not do that. It was 1965 and the Viet Nam war was heating up. John went to Regis High School for extremely smart kids, otherwise, he says, he did not have much self-esteem. John was thinking about how he could avoid the draft. He was not afraid of being killed or maimed in the war, but remembers thinking that he could not imagine going through basic training. 00:48:04 When John came back to NY from the seminary, he sent resumes to Catholic schools to get a job and then get a deferment from the draft. He felt some guilt, until he realized a lot of people were looking for a way out. Rice High School on 124th Street in Harlem hired him. He taught Latin, English and religion. 00:49:16 John went to school at night and became a certified teacher. He would have stayed on at Rice, but wanted to work in a public school. He was sad to leave. John then got a job in Glen Cove, New York. 00:50:06 John taught in Glen Cove from 1969 to the early 1980’s. John taught Spanish – he was certified at Middlebury College as a Spanish teacher. 00:50:46 When John taught at Rice High School, it was all white, even in Harlem. These were the kids that could not get into other Catholic schools. Years later, the school became all black. The school did eventually close. John thought the Cardinal could have subsidized the school! 00:52:04 John received a Law Degree in early 1980’s. He knew he was smart and wanted another secure job. He got the job as a lawyer in New York City Department of Corrections. John asked to start when the school year was over but they made him start in May. Because of office politics, he did not do any real work there until December. 00:53:51 John’s job was to settle a backlog of disciplinary cases against correction officers. They tried to work out settlements for these cases before they went to trial. John retired from this job. The correction officers were not all bad apples. Some correction officers were even living on the subway. The first year was very stressful, then it got better. John told a story about one of the officers whom he helped by working with a social worker. 00:56:45 The Office was in lower Manhattan. Sometimes John worked in an office in Queens. He commuted via the subway. John has not driven since 2000. Cars are not a part of his life. John mainly uses the subway and busses. Even with relatives in the suburbs, he never needs to drive. 00:58:04 John thinks the gay battle has been won. He is not sure what he hopes for the future. Gays, like any group in the populace, need their rights and their programs. John does not think Trump has done anything to damage gay people, although he is certainly hurting poor people and immigrants. The gay community will be one of many communities that will try to get Trump out of office. John thinks gay rights for the most part have been achieved in NY, the city certainly, and maybe New York State. So, we don’t need to be an advocate for gay rights, except for things like a gay senior center. 00:59:52 The Queens Center for Gay Seniors (Center) in Jackson Heights does not call itself SAGE (advocacy and services for LGBT seniors). The Center meets at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, which hosts various groups. The Center has a program that meets Monday to Friday. Danny Dromm came in once with a contingent from Cuba. At that time, John learned that the Center’s origin was not from the gay community, but emerged from the Mario Cuomo deal related to high rises proposed in Forest Hills (1972). The community and the politicians worked out a deal to establish various agencies and build a number of high rises. These agencies were not just for Forest Hills, but other areas in Queens. The Center is a governmental organization, catering to gay seniors, for all of Queens. 01:03:51 There are many programs at the Center. They serve meals every day. John participates in the history discussion groups. John mentioned that as he gets older, he is very interested in history. John then commented on the food – laughing that it does not have much taste! 01:05:24 John hopes that the congestion in Jackson Heights will improve in the future. Quality of life is important. John is not sure what can be done on Roosevelt Avenue, where people want to get in and out as quickly as possible. Danny Dromm created Diversity Plaza about five or six years ago and now there is a major Plaza renovation. John thinks it will be a very beautiful place. 01:06:16 John said the greatness of Jackson Heights is that there is no strife along the lines of ethnic groups or religions. You always feel safe. John lives one-half block away from subway. He recently tried an ethnic restaurant on his block for the first time. It was very creative and delicious food. 01:08:10 John does not go around announcing he is gay, but when it comes up naturally in conversation, he is not afraid to say he is gay. 01:08:36 John thinks that that Queens will develop. He mentioned that if you take the number 7 train, you can see what is happening in Long Island City. There are many new buildings. Many of the apartments are empty and there will be many wealthy people. This is what Queens needs to deal with now. 01:09:07 Interview concluded at 2:50 PM. ",
  "Morrison_Nakeya_timecode.txt": "TW: Okay so where are you from exactly in Queens? NM: I�m from originally from Hollis, Queens, NY. I grew up on Woodhall & 1-95. I actually grew up in like a building type of thing. It wasn�t like a regular home. It was very crowded but me and my mother and my sister made the best of it. And then we actually moved and we actually moved to Linden in St. Albans in Queens. So we been living there for over 10 years now if I�m not mistaken and I been living at Hollis for like� was about 15 years or so. TW: Okay so and moving to Albany do you see a difference between where you lived at before and where you live at now? NM: Definitely, definitely cuz I was happy I finally got my own room. I finally ended up getting my own room. Before it was very crowded me my mom and my sister was sleeping on one bed only and from then I actually liked it because now I can get you know my own little bit of privacy. Basically more privacy, more of doing my own thing now that I�m getting older and I�m of age so it's actually pretty good, I actually like it. TW: You mentioned your mom and your sister so do you only have one sibling? NM: No I actually have more than� I have two sisters and one brother. My older sister is the oldest, I'm the second oldest, and my brother is the third oldest and my little sister is the baby. TW: [laughs] So how is your family Dynamics? like sibling wise and your Mom wise are you guys close? are you distant? NM: Ehhhh It�s in between. You know everybody has situations where sometimes they don't like talking to their mom or they can't deal with their mom� sometimes it gets irritating but we make the best of it, we do our best You know my sister does her own thing now that she's about to have three kids. There's a third one on the way. so you know it's more of family trying to make the best of it and what we're doing and work and stuff like that� taking care of each other and just doing a lot of things on our own basically. TW: So what school did you go to? Growing up what schools did you go to? NM: All right basically my very first school� it wasn't really like a school it was like a Learning Center type of thing. It Was called Lifeline. Then as I growed up I started going to PS 118. TW: Wow! I did not think that was a real school from Hey Arnold. NM: [laughs] Yeah I actually went to PS 118 a lot of people heard of it but it's actually a really good school like they have a lot of activities for younger kids to do and get into so that's why that was my favorite school. Then I went to� my middle school was 192 it's called Renaissance Middle School that school was� it was okay because it was more drama but I'm not really a mixy person, I don't really like to be around drama. Drama is not for me, it�s not my thing and then High School it was way crazier. High School was not like what I expected it. I always thought high school was going to be like High School Musical on TV or something when you have your own locker and stuff and it didn't turn out that way but I made the best of it and I actually left then I went to Delaware Valley Job Corps and that's where I received my high school diploma at 17. and then I graduated at 17. All my school years have been crazy even though I was kind of bad a little [laughs]. TW: What made High School so different than what you thought? Was it the kids? Was it the teachers? Was it just the school? NM: The school the kids, I'll say everything because girl if I tell you stories [laughs] these stories are crazy there were fights everywhere. Teachers fighting with students, you'd be surprised it was a lot going in that school and then we came to find out in our junior or sophomore year they was trying to build another school inside the school already and the school itself is already bad so it's like why would you guys want to put another school in here and it's already hectic in here and you can't control some of these kids already so its like what's the point? But� so we did something like boycotting but it didn't work out, they still ended up building the second school but now it actually calmed down I went back to go visit and actually calmed down now. It's not that much students, it's different kids, they actually have more activities then they did when I was going there. I had� I was actually on the track team. I did track and field and that was about it. That was like the only type of sports I did, other than that I didn't do no other sports. The only sport I know was track and field. I was really more into sports and trying to get my high school diploma and get up out of there. TW: So do you think the location of the school or the area of the school is what made it so bad? NM: No. I'll basically say it's because of where other kids are coming from. Because in the area it was more... I don't want to seem racist or anything but it was more white people so it wasn't really� I can't really say it was the community because it was more elderly people living over there. It was older people with families and stuff like that. They were living there it was more of a white neighborhood so I'll say it was basically you know how we made it. Basically the kids how they made it, how they made it seem. It was like some of the kids didn't know how to act you know it was causing a lot of trouble but other than that it calmed down after a while like Junior year everybody realized arguments and fights are petty which I don't understand. It should�ve been like that from the jump but you know some people grow up differently or some people you know take things differently so I can't really speak for other people but I can speak for myself. TW: So tell me about Job Corps how was that? The transition from High School to Job Corps? NM: Job Corps... It was fun1 I can't even lie, it was actually fun because we learned a lot of different things and me I took up office administration so I know how to type 47 words per minute, I got my certificate for word excel and Powerpoint so basically Microsoft period. I also received a certificate for a lot of things. I can�t even�it's not even coming to my mind of what I received but it was really fun. And the new people who I got to meet. I had an input family and they all from Jersey let me just say that. They all from Jersey but they mad cool and I love them! And I really liked� we actually really treated each other like we was family like if one fight or one bout to get into a fight we all just were all coming. Pick with one we all coming for you. TW: So it was like a real family dynamic? NM: A real� yes definitely and it actually taught you a lot like alot of life learned lessons because Job Corps wasn�t like regular school where you can leave and get food and you know stuff like that. We had to make it and really had to like in our words �Hustle� for the stuff that we need and you know it's all about hustle and how you want it. We don't mean hustle like that but we meet hustle like you know. TW: You need to survive! NM: Yeah it's basically like survival skills and that's one thing I liked about Job Corps because it actually taught you a lot. It might not seem like that and at first you know while you're there but when you start to grow up and start to realize this was actually a life lesson you know. TW: Soo umm, after doing Job Corps what did you do? NM: After doing Job Corps I actually started my first retail job and my first retail job was Old Navy. TW: Did you like that or do you like that if you still work there? NM: No I actually don't work there anymore. I love� I work for my little brother. My little brother has autism so I basically work for him. If you see� But he's very good you wouldn't even think that he has autism to be honest with you. But you know we make the best of it because that's family so basically I do like home health aide work where I can work with him or I can work with other kids. That's what I'm doing as of right now. TW: I kinda can relate because I do the same thing right now. It's just like a different type of feeling I think when you help them out. Okay so what is� you told me your current occupation so what are your occupational goals for the future? Is this something you want to do for the rest of your life? Is there other things you want to venture out of? NM: Home health aide work no. Home health aide work definitely not! I really like it's always been my dream since I was a little girl is to be an RN. That is the main goal I really want to achieve. I was going to school for medical assistant but I had to leave, I had to drop out because I couldn't work and go to school at the same time. My work schedule was interfering with my school schedule so it's really� it was really really hard for me and I couldn't juggle everything at one time. But I made the best of it until the end but unfortunately I wasn't able to receive my degree which I'm very sad about but you know it's never too late to do anything. TW: Exactly!I was going to say you still have time. NM: I definitely still have time especially being 20 years old. TW: Yes you have a lot of time [laughs]. NM: [laughs] Yeah I have a lot of time to do stuff so I'm starting low very low which is the home health aide and then I'm going to start building myself up and I actually� as of right now as a little side job a little hobby I like to do is cooking. I actually have an event today at 8 o'clock TW: Wow! I wish I didn't have to work. I would have been like let me come through. Wow! NM: [laughs] I definitely have an event today at 8 o'clock. TW: So what is your event focused on? NM: Basically my cooking business I'm going to be catering and stuff like that selling plates $10 a plate but as of today my cousin surprisingly so nice of her to book me for her event and it's a surprise party for her boyfriend and she actually booked me to cook. TW: Wow! That's amazing! NM: I'm making a lot of things. TW: So being that you want to start this cooking business where do you see this business going? What type of food would you sell? Where do you want to be located at? Did you think about those things? NM: Definitely, I got those down pack! I am going to cook soul food, American food, and me I'm from the Caribbean so I'm definitely going to have like Caribbean food. I already figured out� I already have a logo and stuff like that so I'm basically set. It's just that I have to set up a Instagram, a booking page and you know all of this at one time but I know I can do it and I know I can achieve my goals as long as I put my mind to things that I want to do I know I'm going to do it and I think that goes for everybody too. TW: You are absolutely right. Okay, Wow you kind of like answered my questions that I didn't even ask you [laughs] okay so are you religious? NM: Definitely. I'm a Christian. (baby crying) TW: Okay are there many religious practices in your community that you live in now? NM: Yes. Down the block where I live it�s Jehovah Witness. It's crazy because in Elementary School PS 118 my teacher� My fifth grade teacher is a Jehovah Witness and from 5th grade to now my teacher still comes to my house she still communicates but like I really love her. That teacher is never going anywhere. That teacher will be my favorite teacher forever. I love that lady. She does everything for me. There was times where I spent the night at her house. She basically was like a second mother figure to me and even though she didn't believe in� You know Jehovah Witness don�t believe in a lot of things but she she respected it, she never put her religion on people or anything like that so that's one thing I liked about her. TW: You met that teacher in PS 118? NM: Yup! TW: Okay. The school that you said was your favorite? NM: Yup! TW: [laughs]That�s funny. Umm so what forms of transportation do you guys use in Queens? NM: We have trains, we have LIRs, we have umm buses. It's a lot of buses let me just say that especially in the Queens area it�s a lot of buses. But we� Some people drive, I can't really say a lot of people but mainly living in the city. New York period is like a lot of people take public transportation. TW: So how is the neighborhood you live in now? Is it Urban? Is it the suburbs? Is it in between? NM: In between. Because it has people coming from different boroughs. A lot of people from different boroughs live where I live now surprisingly. But mainly where I live it's more culture wise. The reasons why I said it's more culture is because we have a lot. We have Asian people, we have Chinese people, we have Jamaicans. It's a lot of Jamaicans, it�s a lot of� there's a little bit of white people too, you know Hispanics so it's very cultured where I live and a lot of people that came from these different countries are living over here. TW: So being that this community you live in now is so diverse do you take the time to learn about other cultures or get into the stuff that they get into? Or no? NM: Yeah my grandfather he was from Panama so I'm definitely mixed with Jamaican and Panamanian so I know about other cultures. I have friends that come from everywhere and I have a lot of Caribbean friends, Spanish friends so I'm a very cultured person and I�m willing to try different things. TW: Wow. That�s� I'm glad you said that. So have any Landscapes and your neighborhood changed over time? Was there any parks or youth buildings that were destroyed or changed? Were there any gentrification going on? NM: So when I first moved here it was one Park that they changed up now. They have like� it's still there they never took it down but they're trying to make changes. TW: What's the name of the park? Do you know? NM: We call it Cambria Heights Park. TW: Okay. NM: It's not far from where I live. It's probably like a good umm 4 blocks away. But they build it like rebuilding it but they don't want to take it down but they're trying to add different things. It's very big though. They also have a big soccer field and baseball field. They also have a lot of basketball courts too. TW: So do you think this creates a sense of like sports in the community? Are you guys big on sports? High school sports? Athletes? And stuff like that being that you have all these things accessible? NM: Yeah, definitely. Yeah we have a lot in Queens. The sports are mainly taking place I'll say for me, in my opinion it's basketball. The reason why is because a lot of these young boys that's living in Queens are doing more things when they're playing basketball. They spend hours in the park, they go after school and play in school gyms. And all you see is basketballs everywhere you go. There's always somebody playing basketball. We do sometimes do a little soccer but to me in my opinion, I can't speak for everybody else, I feel like soccer is more of a cultural thing and more for people that lives in the countries and stuff. TW: Did you do any other sports besides track and field? NM: (baby crying)I did, but it didn't work out too much [laughs]. I did volleyball. I tried out for volleyball but that didn't work out too well. I like volleyball and I always like the volleyball but it didn't work out for me. I realized that I like to run but it's messed up because I can't really do track and field that well because I suffer from asthma so I can't really play that much. TW: So what is the biggest changes you've seen in Queens or the neighborhood you live in specifically? If any. NM: I will say from where I used to live which is Hollis, umm Hollis changed dramatically. Because it's a lot going on in Hollis. I�ve lost a lot of� Basically Hollis is like� It use to be a lot going on now, it's just like very quiet and dull and nobody really goes around there anymore. It's like basically a lot of people forgot about Hollis and you know it's so crazy a lot of these old rappers and rappers now come from Queens and they're from Hollis but they don�t� It really died down. It's not really what it used to be back then when I was growing up. I remember going outside to play and stuff and I realized a lot of kids don't do that now in the Summertime. summertime me and my sister I used to watch my sister play Double Dutch and I used to jump double dutch. It's not the same as what it used to be. TW: Do you think it's the Generation though? Because I know my little sister, her� I feel like she doesn't really go outside either whereas I never wanted to stay in the house when I was her age. I always wanted to be outside as well as like even a little things like it snows and you go around and people pay you to shovel but kids don't even do that nowadays. NM: Yeah and I really do think it is a generation because now my little brothers and sisters they want to play, they just go right on their tablets or their computers. I remember when I was going up, I might be 20 but around my age, my generation age group, we had electronics but it wasn't big as it is. I'm still a 90s kid so I'm a old soul at heart so it's like if I want to play then I'm going to go outside. Sometimes I don't want to be on my phone and I just want to go outside. Sometimes I just be like� It's like when you're at a family function or anything outside in the Summertime you bring back all the old games. It�s like �let's play double dutch, somebody go get an old wires or something.� but now it's not like that anymore. Everybody's just like really growing up and the generation now is more into their electronics than what we was doing back then. TW: I feel like we weren�t really big on electronics at all NM: Right! It was in style. Yes I might still be a baby being 20 but when I was growing up it wasn't it really wasn't that style but now it's like now... TW: It's the trend definitely. NM: It's just crazy like everybody has to have the updated phone. Me personally if I can have the iPhone 8 plus forever I would do it because it's like why am I going to keep going to the Apple Store or going to my phone store and changing my phone to the same thing to do the same thing over and over and over again. It makes no sense! TW: Wow. I agree. I totally agree with that. So have you seen any gentrification going on in Queens? In any neighborhood that you lived in? Do you feel like they came in And try to make an urban area a suburban area and have it appeal to like the middle class? NM: You know what�s so crazy? My area is weird because it's like Urban / Suburban.It's like the suburbs but it's like Urban in between, it's like really weird. Where I live you go closer to Long Island so its mixed. It's like really a lot of mixed people but where I live specifically it's more like the suburbs but it's Urban at the same time. So it's like really weird to describe it I don't know how to describe it but it's like that. TW: It sounds like gentrification, it does. That's exactly what it sounds like but I'm not sure I don't know I don't live there [laughs]. I don't know so we're just going to go off whatever you say. I've never been to Queens before, so if I was to go to Queens what could you tell me about Queens that you think I should know? Where should I go? Where should I eat? Where can I party at? NM: Don't ever tell them where you're from! [laughs] TW: [laughs] Why? Why not? NM: Queens is those people where we don't care as long as you don't be sitting here trying to think you're better than us then we fine [laughs]. Queens people, let me tell you, if they ask you where you're from and you say Jersey or even in the same Borough like Brooklyn or Bronx or something, they be like �eww those areas are trash� Or �those are not it� Like �nobody even heard of jersey� You know stuff like that. But I�ll definitely tell you, well I can't recommend you the city because everybody goes to the city. To me the city is boring. TW: And that's why I'm saying Queens I've never been in Queens so where should I go in Queens and eat and party and stuff like that [laughs]? NM: Girl!! Let me tell you [laughs]� So Queens wise if you want to party you have to go around I think it�s Stine or Stein. I think it�s Steinway that�s closer to� it's around Forest Hills and stuff or going towards Astoria which is not far. They have a lot, I mean every block is club club club club club club club literally like one block is 4 clubs on one block and across the street it's the same thing. And if you keep going its clubs everywhere so I recommend over there. TW: Okay eating? What do yall� Is y'all known for something specifically you know how Manhattan is like pizza and stuff like that so is there anything specific y'all eat? NM: Pizza wise if you ever come to Queens I will suggest you go to Margaritas which is located on Jamaica Avenue in Queens. That's the best pizza. Restaurant wise even though it's in a city, there's one in Queens to its Dallas BBQ's which I think everybody heard of that. TW: Yeah I've been there before. NM: Yeah So that's like nothing new. But other restaurants we have are basically the regular: Olive Garden, Red Lobster. We have� There is however in New York period a restaurant I don't know if you have heard of it. It's located in Brooklyn and it's called footprints. TW: No I have not. What kind of food in stuff is it? NM: It's Caribbean food. It's really good and they're known for their rasta pasta. it's really good. If you go there you're going to like it. Just in advance it's a little expensive but it's worth your money. It's definitely worth your money though, you're going to like it. TW: Another question, being that your area is so diverse do you guys have like cultural stores for other cultures or like little poppy stores or...? NM: Yup! [laughs] No doubt about that one. we have a lot of those. And sometimes you can just be walking up Jamaica Avenue and it's a lot of Africans because you know there's African braiding places. You can go on Jamaica Avenue and they help make the dresses. You know the little dresses that they be wearing and stuff that they be wearing with the hats? TW: Their dashikis and stuff like that? NM: Yes! They will definitely make it for you and on Jamaica Avenue too they have Indians with the little dresses that they wear. It's very cultured so if you're into those type of cultures or you want to learn about them, you can definitely buy the clothes. There's clothes and books and a lot of things you can buy to learn about the cultures and stuff. TW: Okay that's cool. That's very cool. What do you think Queens is known for? NM: Rappers! TW: Okay. NM: I'm sorry [laughs] but hands down New York period is known for rappers. A lot of these rappers that's in� that�s out now are from New York and they�re from each borough and that's how I know New York is doing the thing right now! But Queens I'm sorry Queens have a lot of better rappers. We have this saying in queens� if you come to Queens you might hear it all the time. If we are arguing with another borough or another state or anything we have this saying called �Queens get the money� [laughs] So basically it's like a lot of these uprising rappers, basketball players, and all this stuff are coming from Queens and you'd be surprised and you wouldn't even think� I just found out Kelly Price is from Queens. TW: Oh wow! I didn�t know that either. NM: So it was just like very surprising for me because I'm like� And she's from south side. So it's like you know some of these big artists that you would never know is from Queens and it's crazy and that's one thing I like about it because we�re very known for music. To me I feel like we're known for our music. TW: Okay, so rappers and having the best rappers in music. And I think it's kind of accurate too. Honestly I agree [laughs], I really agree because there� a lot of these rappers especially females they like rep Queens, the males they rep Queens. It's always Queens or Brooklyn honestly. And it's always more so Queens. NM: Exactly. Those two boroughs are the main boroughs for rappers and singers and all this other stuff. I'm just going to say this I'm team Barb [laughs]. I am team Barbie. I am a Nicki fan all the way! No Cardi over here! Sorry! [laughs] I'm always going to be a Barb and I grew up around Nicki. Nicki is just like that person that been holding it down since... TW: Since Warning and Itty Bitty Piggy NM: Yeah like you get what� you see it , you get the memo. You already know the vibes okay! [laughs] I don't even need to explain. As long as you know that's fine with me [laughs]. (31:19) TW: Do you� Does the rappers or like you know the celebrities that come from Queens, do they ever come back or give back or dealt� do anything of that nature? NM: It's crazy you say that, they definitely do. Uhh Where is it?� I think it's by Guy R Brewer, and bas� I think it�s� Yeah! Around here there's this little community garden space and it was from 50 Cent. He comes back every� let me not say every time but he do whenever, whenever he's available he always come back and that's one thing I can say about 50. Umm Nicki? I just seen Nicki in November like the day before Thanksgiving. She did the turkey giveaway. TW: Oh wow! That's what's up. And see some of these things that you're saying the media aren�t� isn't publicizing so I would never know these things. NM: Yeah sometimes an artist will go on their Instagram or go on their social media and promote it because� but then sometimes you don't see it. And that's one thing I don't like sometimes. They don't show these things to make it seem like �Oh these rappers don't know how to give back� and some of them do know how to give back so that's one thing� that�s why I think everybody in Queens will forever love 50 Cent and Nicki Minaj because they always come back. Nicki Minaj she always comes back but you know she's so busy she's like the biggestrap female right now and she be busy so I can't really say she come back all the time but when it's time to come back to her area she's definitely going to come back and she's definitely going to come and she�s definitely going to show love. That's no doubt about that. TW: Okay so for you personally is Queens where your heart is? If so why? If not What place would you want to live at that you think would� you could live the rest of your life? And why as well? NM: It's Queens all day! [laughs] All day! TW: I heard the conviction in your voice! [laughs] NM: It's Queens all day period! That's it! Nothing else. I grew up in Queens so its like I was born and raised. Sometimes I travel back and forth to Brooklyn, let me not lie, but Brooklyn is not really my environment. TW: So what about Queens makes it like you? Makes it so homey? NM: The lingo that we use, the community, knowing everybody because Queens is� it might seem big but it's small and a lot of people we know each other. Some of us grew up around each other. I remember looking at my own friend, I never knew that we we're at the same school. I seen in a picture and I'm like �oh she looks familiar� Then I had to realize it's the same girl I've been chilling with for years and I never knew it. And then I bought the picture to her and she was like �so we knew each other since diapers?� And that's one thing I like about Queens because you never know. It just makes it so homey that everybody's cool with each other [laugh]. TW: It sounds like a great environment. I need to clearly visit Queens. NM: Yeah. You do [laughs]. TW: Are you into like art and stuff there? I know you guys have like� It�s a Museum I want to go to but I forget the name of it but I know you guys have museums and stuff. NM: Probably the Museum of Natural History if I'm not mistaken. TW: Probably [laughs]. NM: Probably the one you talkin about. Ehh I'm tired of that museum [laughs]. TW: [laughs]Are there any other museums? NM: Umm there is, there is, there is. There's one in Brooklyn and that's like the only other one I know and there's one in Manhattan too. I forgot both names but I can look it up and I'll can send you the info so whenever you decide to come out here you can visit all three of those Museums. TW: Okay and I know like Brooklyn has the zoo so do you guys have anything of that nature in Queens? NM: Yeah. Queens they definitely do have a zoo. There's one in Queens, there's one in Brooklyn, and there's one in the Bronx. I don't know about Manhattan. Manhattan is more like city. TW: I feel like they don't have room for a zoo [laughs]. NM: Yeah Manhattan is too crowded so I doubt that they're going to ever build a museum there (she meant to say zoo). Their museum in Manhattan is the sex museum and I don't think that's really a museum for kids. TW: It�s not at all! I've been there so it's definitely not. NM: So I don't really consider it a museum for me. TW: Have you ever been to the Museum of Illusions? I'm not sure where that's at either but I've seen like pictures and things. NM: I've never been there but I've heard about it and living in New York you hear about a lot of places. I've heard about that place but I've never been there. I might go now that you brought it up. TW: It looks pretty cool! It's like a lot of mirrors [laughs] and illusions so it looks cool. Okay I have one last question for you. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? And where do you see yourself in 10 years? What's your five and 10-year plan? NM: Umm 5 years hmm hopefully� maybe by then� let me just say this, probably in two years hopefully my business can get up there. TW: Claim it girl! You got to claim it! NM: It�s like that�s something� I always wanted to start my own business. Me, I'm the type of person where I like to be my own boss sometimes and I feel like that should be everybody's mindset is to be their own boss so in five years I�m praying for my business to get up there. By 10 years or in between 5 to 10 years I'm getting my degree, I'm working, doing what I really want to do which is being a registered nurse and that's about it. TW: I know I said I had one last question but I'm sorry, I have a couple more [laughs]. As you're talkin I started to think of more things to ask you. NM: [laughs] It�s okay. TW: So you want to be a RN? Do you want to work in Queens at a hospital? Do you want to work at a nursing home? Do you work at school? Where do you want to work? NM: I want to work in a hospital. Definitely a hospital because it's more busy and keeps you� even though a nursing home keeps you busy too but it's not as busy as a hospital. I like going to hospitals and seeing nurses know what to say, know what to do, know the codes. Like �let's get this person to this room� I want to be that and my friend, she think she's a doctor because she watches Grey's Anatomy too much so she be feeling like she is a doctor by watching these shows. TW: I'm guilty of that too [laughs]. NM: She�s like� She would post on Facebook �did you know that this causes a tumor� and I'm just like you just watch Grey's Anatomy too much [laughs] and it just needs to be cut. I don't see what's so great about it, I've never watched it but maybe imma try to watch it one day. TW: I think you being� wanting to be a nurse, I think you would really enjoy Grey�s Anatomy. Even though it's not about nurses I think you'll really enjoy it. I don't want� I don�t like�even like the health field and I love Grey's Anatomy, like love it. I'm so scared of blood but I will suck it up for Grey's Anatomy! For real. Is there like a specific department in the hospital you would want to work? Like with kids? Or cancer patients? Or things of that nature? Or just you want to be a jack of all trades? NM: I would like to� If I could I would definitely be all. TW: You can! You definitely can! NM: But In my mind I really want to deal with babies. I love dealing with babies, I love kids surprisingly. And it's messed up because sometimes I don't like watching kids because they get on my nerves [laughs] but it's like what am I going to do without them. And I love my�I think of kids as my siblings because I love my siblings so much so it's just like I think of them as being my brothers and sisters or I pretend like they're my own kids like I birthed them so that�s the field I want to do but if I can do all of them then shoot give me all of them with no problem. TW: Right! Get all those coins! [laughs] Do you want kids of your own? NM: Yup! Definitely, I want a boy. TW: That's it just one? NM: Just one! I know there�s going to be� Even though everybody might say one but for right now one. One is good. Definitely one. One is fine, I'm good with one. That's it I don't need anymore to keep it going [laughs]. TW: Finally, this is really my last question I promise [both laughs]. Do you give back to Queens at anyway? If so how? If not, tell me how you think you should start to give back to Queens. NM: As of right now no. But I really want to you know� I really want to start doing that. I want to do something like� in a way to help older people that�s struggling like single moms and stuff. The only reason why is because there's times where I see my mom struggle but she makes the best of it and sometimes it�s good to help them out because they can't deal with all of it on their own. So sometimes it�s good to give back and see what you can help with, see what you can do for them. As long as it's a little bit of something you know it makes them happy, whatever it is. TW: Something is always better than nothing. And I feel like single moms especially, they go so hard all the time so they appreciate any little thing that you do for them. I feel like being a mom is one of the hardest jobs there is to do. NM: But they make the best of it. TW: Exactly and they rarely complain about having to make the best about it. NM: Exactly! TW: Well I want to thank you so much for doing this for me and I truly appreciate it. NM: You�re welcome. ",
  "Moy_Joyce_timecode.txt": "Close friends Bess Debetham and Joyce Moy interview each other about their experiences in Queens and as part of the General Assembly, led by Queens Borough President Helen Marshall. They discuss the journeys that led them to live in Queens and the positions they take on matters of the community that they are passionate about. Susan Tanenbaum also adds her own inquiries about inspiring instances of the General Assembly. 00:00:49 Joyce came to Queens when she got married and had her first home in Bayside. Her grandfather had a house and business in Jackson Heights and one of her uncles was born in Flushing. 00:01:48 Joyce has a tendency to advocate, which she realized when she did a lot of work for the community as an attorney. When she worked at Queens College and other CUNY schools, she advocated for students, community organizations, and outreach for marginalized people. 00:07:04 The people who joined the Queens General Assembly were very open and wanted to hear. Joyce commends the borough president Helen Marshall for seeing the need to create a dialogue that would nurture cultural understanding. 00:09:46 Joyce finds the Festival of Lights to be particularly memorable because lights are common to all cultures. 00:13:32 She feels that the borough president is a visionary for meeting the community that she represented and understanding them. She credits Helen Marshall�s background in education for this. 00:14:38 Joyce felt skeptical at the earlier meetings of the General Assembly, but as time went on, she felt that people were more open than the usual �feel-good� organization. 00:019:38 She was grateful to participate in the General Assembly and decided to get involved even though she was skeptical because the Asian voice was not being heard or was being stereotyped. 00:22:12 When asked about her presentation of being an American, Joyce replied that she wanted people to understand how you could simultaneously be a part of the US and not be a part of the country as well. She also wanted people to hear how others that weren�t paid attention to contribute to their community. How the society sees and treats people determines whether they will remain outsiders or integrate into the community. 00:23:34 The Chinese Exclusion Act passed in 1882 made it impossible for Chinese people to become citizens, whether or not they were born in the US. This was overturned in court in 1943, but the growth of the entire Chinese community had already been stunted. The generations before Joyce�s felt that they weren�t wanted and did not participate in civic duties. 00:25:41 If Joyce were to leave any major legacy, it would be for all young people to learn about the history of this country and what it has meant to marginalize groups of people in order to prevent it from happening again. 00:28:11 Joyce is the executive director of the Asian American Asian Research Institute at the City University of New York. She created a team that spoke English, Spanish, Korean, and three dialects of Chinese when she realized that minority and immigrant businesses were not getting the attention they needed. 00:30:00 Joyce begins interviewing Bess Debetham. 00:30:30 Bess came to New York from the state of Alabama right out of high school to Huntington, Long Island, where her first cousin was living. She discovered that her best friend whom he graduated high school with was living in Rockaway. Bess came to Queens on the LIRR and found that she had family living there. She loved Queens, but was disappointed that she couldn�t get the job she wanted without any experience. She eventually found another job and got married and stayed in Queens. 00:32:22 Community activism means more to Bess than her regular job because she has been able to accomplish more in activism. She didn�t want to gain attention, but felt forced to act in order to protect and look out for others. 00:35:56 Bess feels that when things are made better in a community, everyone benefits and find that they have more in common. She gets a high from doing something for others more than getting money from a job. 00:35:18 When Bess takes a position, she�s always thinking about the next person. When she came to the General Assembly, she had certain prejudices, but didn�t want to hold on to them after hearing Joyce speak at the Assembly. She�s now learned to remind others not to slander an ethnic group. She shares a story about overhearing a conversation at LaGuardia Airport about another ethnic group and getting the speaker to stop. 00:39:48 Bess�s most memorable experiences of the General Assembly were listening to Joyce discuss what it means to be an American and the Festival of Lights. 00:42:30 Bess would like to get younger people more involved and have the older people be mentors. She believes in telling young individuals that they can be anything they want to be, but they must get an education. 00:49:19 Bess believes it is so critical that children be explained to why adults suggest certain things. She doesn�t believe black children are exposed to the different facts of life and as many cultural things as they should be. She blames the adults of the black community for not taking the time to mentor the youth and expose them to professions other than rapping. 00:56:31 Bess remembers the Queens Borough president making the statement that diversity is one of their greatest resources. By joining the General Assembly, Bess became a resource. 00:59:00 Susan Tanenbaum begins interviewing Bess. 00:59:52 Bess recalls what it was in Joyce�s presentation about being an American that affected her so much. Americans didn�t accept Joyce because she was Chinese and when she went to China, they didn�t accept her because she was too American. Bess saw herself in this because her she feels she is an American, but is not accepted. She compares her growing up on a farm where her father grew their food because they couldn�t afford anything in the store to Joyce�s mother making sure everyone was fed when they had very little rice. 01:03:53 As part of Board 13, Bess works for the land use, public safety and transportation committees. She is also part of a civic organization called Federated Blocks of Laurelton founded in 1972. She doesn�t consider herself a leader, but rather an advocate for change. She part of the Eastern Queens Alliance, which is fighting the Kennedy Airport on extending a runway further into the community, which would require removing hundreds of trees, whose roots prevent flooding. 01:10:10 Many Jewish families moved into the Cambria Heights area. This Cambria Heights community felt that they were mistreated. [This demographic change was prompted by the interment of the Lubavitcher Rebbe in nearby Montefiore Cemetery]. 01:17:38 Bess says if we talk about how we feel, we will discover others feel the same way. 01:19:00 Bess wanted to see how she would grow due to the General Assembly. She considered herself and the other members seeds that were being planted and referred to the them as a garden. ",
  "Murray_Christian_timecode.txt": "“This is my neighborhood. I want to know what’s going on. Everyone needs to know what’s going on.” Each day Christian Murray takes his two Boston Terriers on a long walk through Sunnyside. He carries a camera and a notebook to gather material for his website, the Sunnyside Post. Christian misses no community board or police precinct meeting. Whether residents complain about the size of their Christmas tree, Sunnyside hosts a Pumpkin Day or troublemaker Casa Romana incenses the community with a Wet-T-Shirt and Oil-Wrestling Party, Christian reports, follows up and often sets an example for local community leaders. (A couple of days after Christian reported on the planned event, Jimmy Van Bramer announced the event thwarted.) “This is my neighborhood. This is where I live. I want to know what’s going on. Everyone needs to know what’s going on,” Christian says matter-of-factly as we sit down to talk. A financial reporter for Thompson Reuters by day and a blogger during late night and lunch break hours, the native New Zealander started the Sunnyside Post two years ago. He updates the blog at least ten times a week, with roughly half of all postings gleaned from local newspapers and the other half featuring original reporting. “I sometimes spend two or three hours a day [on the blog],” he says. “My wife thinks I am crazy.” But his website provides him pleasure, and the human interest issues offer a good balance to his “dry and abstract” nine-to-five job. A few months ago the Sunnyside Post began posting ads from local businesses and institutions, including Camp Bow Wow, the Sunnyside Reformed Church and Santa Fe Steak House, and most recently it was revamped to better reflect Christian’s main focus, “Keeping the vitality of our main streets going.” The Sunnyside Post now also collects suggestions on how to improve business on Queens Boulevard. In the podcast, Christian talks about a large fire on 42nd Street that other news outlets failed to report and about his blogging obsession. ",

He was a host, telling visitors basic information about the pavilion and the Fair. He got the job through the placement bureau at Queens College, and worked a 4-10pm shift six days a week. The job was delightful because he got to meet people from all over, as well as seeing diverse performances. The floor of the Pavilion was built by Texaco � Flushing was initially left off the map. 00:05:01 Performances happened inside the tent on a large stage. During the course of day there could 25 to 30 different groups performing. The performances were free and totally open to the public, and the schedule of performances was posted. Everything was very glamorous. Visited the top of the Pavilion, from where you could see all five boroughs. He sometimes hung out at the Fair on Friday or Saturday. During the summer of 1965 he worked at the Chrysler Pavilion, where he met college students from across the city. There were about 30 people on each shift, and it was a very social environment. He made $120 a week, which was more than her earned after graduating at his first job. 00:10:37 Al Musaffi volunteers on the restoration of the New York State Pavilion, as part of the $5 million grant to return the Pavilion to a useable state. During the 2014 Anniversary festival there were tours of the Pavilion. The New York State Pavilion allowed him to see performance groups, at the Chrysler Pavilion he met a diverse set of his peers and he was 21 so he could get alcohol. He was the right age, and in the right place, to have the great experience of working at the World�s Fair. ",

  "Nevins_Bill_timecode.txt": "Mary Devitt (MD): My name is Mary and I�ve lived here for 44 years Jeanne O�Melia (JO): And I�ve lived here since 1978, almost 33 years Denis Curtin (DC): I�ve been here since 1960. I�ve been in America since 1958, but in Astoria since 1960. The neighborhood was good. It was all working people. And the prices were good. And it was centrally located. You were in the city in 10 minutes. Astoria has always been good. When I first moved here, actually I was a kid. I went to High School, over in Sunnyside. I married and divorced and have three boys. They�re all grown up and married themselves. The youngest is 37. But I love Astoria. I�m a big park guy. And I�m a big reader. Sometimes I�m up at 5, 6 in the morning, I get a coffee and a donut; I drive down to Astoria Park. There�s not as much Irish community as there was before. It was a big German community originally. MD: When we came here in the 1960s, it was German. German, Italian, and Irish, but I�d say predominantly German more than anything else. St Joseph�s Church was founded by the Germans. Then of course you�ve got Kaufman Studios down on 34th Avenue, you�ve got the famous Steinway Street. You get quite a lot of religions here too. You had quite a lot of Jewish people in Astoria. There were quite a lot of Lutheran churches and schools. And then down towards Ditmars you have mostly Greeks, the Greek area. DC: And you have all the old mansions down between here and Astoria Boulevard, you have all the old mansions from the sailing days. And the old buildings have the captains� walkways and stuff on the top, where the wives would watch their husbands arrive on the sailing ships. MD: A lot of people have moved out to the suburbs. The Germans moved out to Middle Village. The Italians went out to Whitestone; the Irish went to Lake [xxx]. JO: I used to live in Corona, which was a very good place at one time. I was born there. I could tell you every store, everything about Corona. Then I moved to Jackson Heights, and then I came down here. I moved here because my mother was getting old then. She couldn�t climb the stairs any more. We were in a walk-up apartment, for 20 years. But we couldn�t stay. My sister was here and she invited me down. My sister was with me and she lived to be one hundred. She came from Ireland, and my father too. She came in about 1914. She was going to school; she wanted to be a nurse. And she used to go at night. And my dear father, he worked at nights too. And there was the token booth man at the station. And my mother would come through there to get on the train and go, and my father too. And the man behind the booth, he said to my father, you know there�s a nice young Irish girl who comes through here every night, she goes to school. Maybe you�d like to meet her. And that�s how my mother met my father! And they got married. My mother never became the nurse. She was a nurse to all of us. She had six children. I have a sister who lives in Michigan, another one in Florida. My brother�s in Connecticut, and I lost one brother, and I�m here, and I have another one in Vermont. She used to live with me. DC: We meet here every day. And if one of us doesn�t show up, the other one will call to see what they�re doing. JO: We talk and we eat, we talk and we eat MD: And we tell jokes and we laugh. JO: Mary tells the greatest jokes. DC: You can find us here four, five hours a day. MD: The best thing about 30th Avenue, you�re near to all the conveniences, to shopping, to churches, to the subway. And you have a wonderful mix of people here. Which keeps us all grounded. DC: And you actually know your neighbors. Bill Nevins (BN): There used to be a lot of bars along this stretch; a lot of bars. From Steinway to up here I can think of seven bars there used to be here. Now they�re gone, and there are more caf�s instead. There used to be German delis too, in the early 60s. I came to Astoria in 1960. I was born in Manhattan, on the Upper East Side. I lived in Long Island, but then they dropped the house. I moved here with my grandmother. And we stayed. I love Astoria. There are a lot more different ethnic groups now. Astoria always changes. Before 1911 we had a lot of mid-western people came here to work. That�s usually what happens. When the economy�s good, Astoria turns yuppie again. But after 1911, there were a lot of young people leaving. Astoria, it dictates what the rest of Queens does. These were Matthew flats [off 30th Avenue]. I have a barn in the backyard of my house where they used to keep horses. When I moved in there 31 years ago they still had the four stalls inside the barn. What people miss: MD: I miss Woolworths on 31st. And the Triboro movie theater. DC: That had the stars in the ceiling. It was like the universe when you looked up. It was heartbreaking to see it pulled down. Now its apartments. The guy pulled it down overnight. They knew it was a landmark but they ripped it down. MD: And Phil�s kosher restaurant on Steinway was great too. Steinway bakeshop. Schaller and Weber, all German meats. Norgards Bakery, down near the train. Mount Sinai hospital was Astoria General Hospital before. BN: Actually Mr. Drago [of RP Drago Funeral Homes] built that, Astoria General. They�d say that he killed them and his son used to bury them. Mr. Drago has died now. DC: The old man used to come over here to the church and call out the bingo numbers. It�s different people managing it, the funeral home, now. The Matthew flats were built along the railroad routes. BN: I remember a farm just right here. Dougans Pond. Danielle Pagliaro (DP): And there�s a guy who has a farm between 43 and 42, he has a farm behind the whole block. He used to give the food to the nuns. DC: My ex-wife, we have three kids together. She lives at 30th and 42nd Street, and she�s got to be, about 61, 62, anyway, she was born in that apartment. And her father moved there when he was 12 years old. BN: Ever seen the movie the Bronx Town? It was filmed right here. DC: Up here where La Guardia airport is, that was called North Beach. I don�t remember that but the old timers talk about it. They would go swimming up there. That was like going to the country. BN: There was that farm, between 21st and 22nd between Broadway and 34th Avenue, and there was an English castle opposite it, with turrets and everything. And when I did my newspaper round when I was about ten, they gave me that castle to drop the paper off at. I was afraid. Then we heard that the guy there died and we became braver. They tore that down. DP: We used to have awesome parties. You used to come outside in the summer and every block had people on the streets, kids. Whether you lived on this block or that block, people knew who you are. If you got seen doing something wrong, you�d get caught by the ear and dragged back to your mother. MD: And one person would have the responsibility for putting on the fire hydrant in the summer. BN: The schoolyards used to be so much bigger. There used to be these huge schoolyards when I was a kid. PS70 � greatest yard anywhere. MD: At six o�clock on the dot you�d hear the mothers calling, �Jonny, Billy�, get up! And because there were so many kids on the blocks, you used to have your own baseball team and your own football team, and they played each other. There is show on Channel 21 every once in a while, called The Street Games of New York. You never had a kid being bored. You went out and played, you came in and did your homework, and then you went out and played again. People used to use boxes and old wheels to make go-carts. And then there was bobcats, you would put the crayons on top of the bulb to melt the wax. And Johnny ride the pony. BN: And the fat kid was always the �pillow�, and the others would line up and charge his stomach. MD: We had a lady on our block called the witch, because she didn�t want kids playing there DP: I think every block had a witch. And a cat lady. BN: These houses, where you go downstairs, that used to be street level. In my house, you go out the back and you go 15 feet down. They didn�t dig holes to put the pipes in, they just put them right there. But overall we�re up high here; we�re about 20 feet above sea level. MD: So we�re safe if there�s a tsunami. BN: The best time was 1964. The Mets won at Yankee stadium, there was the exhibition at Flushing. BN: Steinway Street used to be a very expensive street. People would come from Manhattan to shop there. And this was like vacation spot, like being the country. There used to be a Woolworths. That was the best store in Steinway. And the old wooden creaking floors. You could get anything in there. You could by goldfish. Anything. DP: I used to go with my grandmother to get yarn, just so I could have the meatloaf and apple pie at the counter. MD: You used to have great ice-cream parlors in Astoria. Egg creams you had. BN: These houses you used to have to heat them with coal. There was the front fireplace and the back fireplace. You had a space in the basement where you could keep your coal. My father used to say that if you saw no coal in that space, the people in that apartment were very cold. DC: You had windows between each room for the ventilation. All the Matthews had yellow bricks. That was from Pennsylvania. ",
  "Nieves_Meredith_timecode.txt": "Me: So my name is Greg Synsmir and I’m here with Meredith Millington and I guess my first question would be how was your childhood? Like if you had one- like can you describe your childhood for me at all? Where’d you grow up? Meredith: I loved my childhood which is seemingly rare these days. Umm I grew up in Manhattan, I was born here, my parents were born here. Umm my mom was German, my father was Puerto Rican so everybody always thought that was a really odd mixture of being super-organized and not so much. Umm.. and I’ve never left Manhattan except to go to college. So I spent five years in St. Louis, otherwise I’ve always lived in New York City and on the West Side… Well not on the West side, my first six years were on the East Side and then we moved to the west side. Umm… and my brother as well is here. Me: So I know I saw that you mentioned that your father served as a vet in the Korean War? Meredith: Yeah sorta (Laughter) Me: Well what do you mean by sorta? (Chuckles) Meredith: Umm he was drafted, he was in the (stutters) in the Korean War and he was not very good at behaving and should have gone to battle. But at the last minute they needed somebody with his expertise in Music and entertaining to go to Germany and work with civilians instead. So he actually didn’t see combat even though he is technically a veteran of the Korean War. He worked with civilians and performed and… stuff like that. Me: That’s a blessing (chuckles) Meredith: Yes, no I mean that was a blessing. Me: Right, and is that where he met your mother? In Germany or is, no, no Meredith: No umm he met her in Maine. In a Gilbert and Sullivan acting company called the “Savoyards.” Me: Oh okay. And was your parent’s like love for art and music specifically, I know they were both heavily involved with music, did that spark your interest in art at all? Did that (stutters) have anything to do with it? Or they not correlated at all? Meredith: Umm… I’m not sure. I have loved creating art my whole life. Umm I loved art as a little girl, and when my father saw that I did- my father was a renaissance man. He went to the high school of music and art. Umm which is not called that anymore. Umm and he got in for both, had to choose music cause they made him pick one. But he also studied art on his own and when he saw that I liked art, he started teaching me little things umm, on his own so he taught me about you know light and shade and perspective and things like that. And then I would bring home art works from school and he would say, “Why didn’t you put a shadow on it?” And I would say well we haven’t learned that yet in school. He goes, “But you know how to do it.” I said, yeah but that’s weird (laughs). Umm so I would (pauses) you know I did my own thing at school and most children bring art pieces home and their parents say “Oh it's so beautiful,” and they put it on the refrigerator. And he would actually give me a critique. And it could’ve worked one of two ways, it could’ve made me not want to do art anymore but instead it inspired me to do better. And I always- you know everyone would always say, “what’s your favorite subject in school?” And I would say it art, it’s art, it’s hahaha because it’s not supposed to be. And then when I getting to high school and my favorite subject was still art, I said “okay I gotta do something here.” And when I was… I guess 14 I think? 13 or 14 umm it was the summer and mother said “You cannot do nothing anymore. Get a job, go to camp, something. Don’t sit around the house.” So my father suggested I take a class at the art students league. Umm so he got the catalogue we picked one out, he took me down there and in signing me up they said, “Okay and you know you have to be 16 to come here.” And he looked them straight in the eye and said “She’s 16!” And they said, “Okay!” (laughs) They don’t care. So he.. So he was an inspiration for to keep going with my art umm I don’t know if I just had an artistic gene because of theirs umm but its always been there. Me: Wow. And I also saw that a member - you’re the president of the co-op. The Abingson Square Painters co-op right? And you were a member since 1988. So you guys were based in Manhattan before you guys went to Queens? Meredith: Yes and I’m gonna use my cheat sheet because I’m bad with dates. So the Abingson Square Painters started in 1948. Umm in an apartment on Abingson Square in the West village. Umm by a woman named Harriet Fitzgerald and it was a place for both professionals and students to work together. Umm and learn from each other. Um, then they moved to 14th street, 210… 210? I think so. West 14th between 7th and 8th. Umm they incorporated themselves in 1964 to be 501C3 charitable organization. Umm and they got funded, not entirely but a lot, by umm something called the New York Community Trust. Umm a family called the Phillips family left the Phillips fund for the Abingson Square Painters if they kept their mission of a teaching studio, not necessarily with teachers, but just a place to work and grow and not necessarily be for- it’s not for profit, it’s- you don’t have to be a selling artist. Some people are some people aren’t. Umm and we have to do some community outreach so invite community in to see our work. Umm, I went to Washington University in St. Louis, School of fine art, graduated with a painting degree, came back to New York, had a roommate in one-bedroom with an easel in the living room and my mother said- there was a dance teacher where I went to school- I went to Brearly and my mother taught there and she goes, “You know I think your dance teacher is also a painter and might have a little group of some sort.” So I thought maybe it was a little sketch group that got together in a living room somewhere, so I contacted her and she invited me to this studio called the abingson square painters and explained it all to me. And I had to submit a portfolio of my work and, they accepted me as a member so at first I was just a member and they have an executive committee umm with President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary. They have formal meetings twice a year with under Robbers rules with minutes and what not. And as I got more involved I became the Secretary. Umm, and it just sort of grew from there. And it was just this great experience that this woman who taught me dance when I was six years old, is now my peer in an art cooperative. Umm, and we started getting priced out of Manhattan and she started getting older and the director whose name is Gene Marrow- her name is Peggy Anderson (Dance teacher), both started getting older wanting to leave the city, and they just started telling me more, and more, and more, and more and suddenly I realized, “They’re grooming me for this.” Cause I never really wanted to be president of the Abingson Square Painters (chuckles) that was not my goal, I just wanted to paint. Umm but they basically said “we’re leaving and we are passing the torch to you,” so I was like okay… And once they were gone, I think within two years I realized that we did not have the money to stay in our studio. If we stayed, we would have two years and then we’d have to close. And there was nowhere to go in Manhattan umm, and somebody told us about Long Island City so we checked it out, did the math, it was not that hard to get to from Manhattan, so we said “You know what… If we lose some members, we lose some members.” Otherwise we’re done. Umm so in 2010, we moved to Long Island city. It’s our 3rd location, we’ve been in the Long Island City Art Center building since then. But we’re in our 3rd space within the building, and hopefully our last. Umm… and we’re smaller than we used to be but we continue and now that makes us a part of the Queens community. Umm we have some artists from Queens, and it’s I don’t know…. It got me over there and I just love it. Me: Have you noticed any changes in Long Island City since you’ve been there? Since you guys originally touched down and got there? Meredith: Huge. Me: Huge changes. Meredith: Long Island City’s ridiculous (Laughs). Umm we got there, there were other studio buildings. Umm, now I think two of those buildings have been demolished. Uhh, there are high rises going up everywhere. There was nothing there. And now it’s just- I don’t know who’s coming to live because massive expensive Co-ops and condos are growing all over the place and there’s you know, there’s no vegetable store, there’s no dry cleaner, there’s no- there are a few but they’re by the river. But it’s like where- there’s hardly any place to eat that’s worth eating at. Umm, so I’m like “What are they doing?” So I believe that they are putting up high rises and they’re gonna put all of the amenities on the ground floor or something for people. Or they’re just investment properties, I have no idea. But it’s a little scary cause we don’t wanna get priced out of Long Island city now, uhh and hopefully that won’t happen. Me: That was my next question. I was gonna say do you fear getting priced out of Long Island City now that you see- I mean this sounds like gentrification to me but I don’t know. Meredith: Yeah totally. Me: Yeah right. And so I don’t know that- if that’s a fear that you guys have in the Co-op at all. Meredith: We do. Umm, I feel we’ve lived in fear of gentrification forever cause when we were in Manhattan, it was the meatpacking district that suddenly turned into the place to be that eventually priced us out of where we were. It took 20 years, but it happened. Umm, and now it really depends on if the building we’re in, is gonna stay what it is, or if they’re going to try to capitalize on what’s going on around them. I mean it’s supposed to be an art center, it has a school in it, it has dance classes, it has a theatre, and it has a lot of other artists. So they could keep it that way but they have to realize that if that’s what it is you can’t overcharge them. Or if they want to move with the neighborhood and become something else, everyone will leave. And then I don’t know what will happen (chuckles). Me: So is it safe to say- I mean do you like Queens at all? I mean have you liked your time there since you’re there on business. Have you liked your time there since you guys moved there? Meredith: I have actually I think about two years after umm, the studio moved there- umm I work for a woman who became my best friend. And we were getting priced out of Manhattan for office space and we were looking for new office space and looking around Manhattan and I go, “We should really look at Long Island City! We should really look at Long Island City! (Laughs)” And event- and she actually lives on the east side and has a car, so for her to get to Long Island City is a hop, skip, and a jump over the 59th street bridge. It’s a lot harder for me. Umm, and she said “Okay, fine.” And we got a realtor and we started looking and we moved to Long Island City and we got three times the space for half the price-or less and we love it. It’s a reverse commute, it’s so calm, you go there and you’re not bumping around people, you wanna go out at lunch and take a walk. Umm, she and I even started running by the river at lunchtime twice a week to get some exercise (laughs). It’s really a nice community. Me: But the rapid change, has that changed your opinion of it all? Meredith: It hasn’t changed my opinion because I guess since I don’t live there, umm Im not aware if it has changed businesses or not, the small businesses. Like in Manhattan, I’m very aware that there used to be smaller stores, mom and pops, more creative places to go. And now it’s bank, duane reade, bank, bank, duane reade, CVS, supermarket, and that’s about it. Umm, so I don't know if that’s happening yet in Long Island city but.... The landscape is definitely changing. It’s going up. Me: Yeah. So, have you taken your family out to Long Island City at all? Like have you ever like explored Long Island City with your family at all and thought about possibly moving there I guess is the question, right? Meredith: A little bit. Umm, they’ve come to- the studio does an exhibit once a year and they come to that. Umm, after which we have had dinner at times. Umm, I have looked at real estate in Long Island city, cause we would love more space. Umm, and by the time I was doing it, it was already just as expensive as here (chuckles). Uhh, so it unfortunately doesn’t look like that’s gonna happen. Me: Right. It sounds like Long Island City is near and dear to your heart so that’s why I wanted to harp on that a little bit. Meredith: It’s just- it’s convenient cause you’re there but you’re- so easy to get back into Manhattan. It’s really centrally located. Me: Right, and so do you paint and you exhibit your artwork for the co-op at all or is it just about everybody else? Meredith: Yes. No, no, no it’s a- everybody, it’s a working studio. So we’re all members, we all paint there, we have 24/7 access. Umm, a little storage area, and then we share the room. And it’s a cooperative because it’s not an assigned space, it’s not an assigned time. Umm, members are accepted with the thought in mind of when you’re gonna use it. So if we already know the we’ve got half of our members wanting to use it weekday mornings and we have space for another artist, we probably wouldn’t accept one who said, “I’m coming weekday mornings.” Umm, not that they wouldn’t be allowed to, but then they’d sort of have to defer to whoever’s already there. Umm, so yeah we all- I paint there- umm, I paint here too but that’s only cause I get busy with kids and husbands and work but yeah no, I still paint there. We have our exhibit every May.. uhh, (phone rings) I’m sorry. Me: No that’s okay. Meredith: (Turns off phone) It’s called spam (laughs). Me: Don’t worry about it, it’s fine. (laughs) Meredith: Anyways, umm, what was I saying? (thinks out loud mumbling) We use to have- when we had our exhibits in Manhattan, we had a lot of people that knew people, friends, family, church members, neighborhood people who would come. And we moved to Long Island city and had an exhibit, and very few people came. So, we had to re-think it and the Long Island city arts organization? (questioning tone) Umm, (daughter comes home) Umm, Long Island City arts association LICA. Umm, they started doing umm, a two week long art event- open art event for Long Island city which involved theatre, dance, art and they had one weekend which was an open studios tour. So, we were like, “okay we need to start having our annual exhibit, the weekend of the open studios tour (laughs). To get new people to come see us.” Uhh, so that’s what we do now. Me: Right. So, I’m losing my train of thought here (chuckles). Umm, I guess my follow-up question for you in this situation would be when, when you were younger, was there any moment- like ah-ha moment for you where like art, where you knew that art- I know you said that you always loved art, but was there a moment that you can think of like that specifically like you’ll never forget where art- It seems cliche and corny but was there that moment where you ever looked at something and you were like “yeah this is what I want to do,”? Meredith: (Long pause) Not to that dramatic degree, I think it was more as I said before that, when it was still my favorite thing to do in high school, when you’re supposed to start thinking about what you’re gonna be when you grow up and college and all of that, that I was like, “I wanna be an artist. I want to paint.” And, that’s when I knew that you know, I wanted to go to art school. I also because I have a German sensible mother, I was raised with that- she didn't have to tell me this- I just said, “It’s risky. So I should get- I should go to a regular college or university, but that has a really good art school in it so that I have the academic backup.” So that’s what I did. Me: Right. And so what do you- I know, I read into what you do for a living as a- working in merchandising. But you want to go into that a little bit and explain that? Just what you’re primary source of income would be. Meredith: Sure umm, just a little history I.. So after college I first worked for a Art news magazine cause I thought that would be a way to stay connected with the arts. But that was kinda dull. Umm, then I got a job with a company called Schieffelin & Somerset which was umm, it’s a liquor company. Umm, a marketing company and my purpose was, I just wanna work somewhere that’s fun but 9 to 5 so that I can then go and pursue my art after work and on weekends. Umm, so I was just a marketing assistant- basically secretary at work and I was doing that. And then I was getting older and older and I wasn’t getting my wing at the Metropolitan museum yet. That was pissing me off.. Umm, and I had little shows here and there but I was learning that the art world in New York was not what I thought it was. And if you didn’t know somebody umm, it was pretty hard to get anywhere. So, one of the things that they did at this company was you make merchandise for bars and liquor stores to promote the alcohol brands we had. And we had the big ones, we had the johnnie walker, the Moets, the Hennessy, and what not. So I started working on the marketing side of that and then I changed departments there into being the buyer for that stuff. Umm, then the company split and I morphed into the Moet Hennessy company from there. Umm, and I started realizing that I enjoyed the making of the stuff more than just finding the person to make the stuff. Umm, so when it came time to leave there I had now become friends with- I’m having an interview sweetheart thank you (talking to her daughter who came in the room) Umm I didn’t tell her because she wasn’t supposed to be home. Umm, so I spoke to- I had now become very good friends with one of my suppliers. And I said, “I wanna leave here, you need help, can I work for you?” And she said, “Okay.” (laughs) Umm, so I started working with her and at that point we worked on a lot of liquor brands. Umm, making glassware for the packages you see in liquor stores, umm, bar mats, napkins, up to display tables with custom mosaic tables. We could basically do anything from, “Do you want a pen? Or do you want to draw us a picture and we’ll find someone to make it.” Umm, and then now, we have fewer liquor companies, we still have a few. Umm, but my major client has turned into making the merchandise that they sell at the broadway theaters. So I work with another company as my client and when they get a show, they call me and say, “okay this is what we need done.” And it’s anything from you know, a magnet, something simple to my latest thing is trying to make the plush doll to look like the new King Kong. In the King Kong on Broadway that just got miserable reviews and we’ll never get to produce the guy I’ve been working on for three months, but we’ll see. Umm (chuckles), and all this cute stuff for mean girls and pretty woman and stuff like that. So it’s a way to use an art brain, because its design, and it’s color in that sensibility. It’s not exactly painting. But at least it- it pays bills and it’s.. It can be creative. Me: Right, I was gonna say it’s relatively connected to your passion, a little bit and that’s the interesting thing about it. And you answered my question- my next question when you said it was a way for you to use your art brain. But umm, would you say that- like is that where you want to be? Like I know it’s probably not an question to answer- or it could be an easy question to answer but like is that where you want to be for the rest of your life? Or is there something else for you- like is there another step in you professional career that you’re gonna take where you’ll head even more into art? Meredith: It’s probably gonna stay the way it is right now umm, one thing I learned- one of the other reasons I had wanted to work for my friend umm, is corporate America was getting old, umm, I had two little kids, and I didn’t like the stress. And what happens now is- everybody has stress. I’m working on projects, I’m working on deadlines- not everything works out and it’s stressful, but there’s not the stress of, “My boss is gonna get angry, I’m not gonna get promoted- somebody’s gonna take over, I’m gonna get fired.” You know, I have a problem I’m like, “Hi Linda my best friend, I’m having trouble with this can you help me out?” And she’s like, “Of course I can help you out! Let’s work on it together.” And it’s- So I just find that having that I guess healthy job is more important than the big powerful high-paying one. Umm, and then hopefully you know with my kids- they’re now teenagers you know and don’t really want me around anymore- I can re-focus more energy back into the painting and see where that can take me. You know maybe now I can do something more with it than I’ve done. Umm, but you know I’m getting old-er, so I don’t think there’s gonna be a big career shift.. Unless my husband does something crazy. Me: (Laughs) So are you-actually I didn’t ask you about that yet. You transitioned nicely. How did you meet your husband? Did you- we didn’t talk about that I guess it’s a good question? Meredith: So you want the long romantic story or the quick one? Me: (Laughs) whatever you think is best. Meredith: (Laughs) Umm, there was a restaurant in my neighborhood- actually it’s still there called “Bella Luna,” on Amsterdam avenue and they exhibited artwork of neighborhood people. And I went in there one day and I spoke to the manager and I said “You know I’m an artist, I live in the neighborhood, I’d love to exhibit here.” He looked at my work, he said “This would fit in, you could do that.” We set up a time when I could have a show and I said great okay. Umm and I had a day off from work before this was gonna happen so I went to the restaurant during the day cause I just wanted to measure the walls, figure out what pieces I wanted to bring, and there was this guy working there. The day manager/waiter and I said who I was and he’s like “Alright whatever.” You know and I did my thing and then I had a show up for three months but I never went back during the day, I always showed up nights and weekends. And after three months the show came down, and a couple weeks later my phone rang and this guy said “I worked Bella Luna, I met you a long time ago, and I really liked your art work and I was away when the show came down and there was this one little painting and umm, I’d like to know how much it costs. I think I wanna buy it.” I go “Oh okay. Which one was it?” He says “It was a small one of pears laying on the column by the window.” And I said “The column by wherever?” He goes “Yeah,” and I go “Yeah those are peaches.” I was a still life artist at the time. And he goes “Yeah no it was pears.” I said, “No there’s a SMALL ONE THE BLAH BLAH… I go it was peaches,” and he goes “I really think it was pears.” So I said, “Okay do you live in the neighborhood?” “Yeah,” “Would you like to come over and look at it and see if this is the painting you’re talking about?” He like “Okay!” So he came over, and he goes “Yes that’s the painting.” I said “okay great, those are peaches.” Umm, I gave him a price, he told me that he was in a rock & roll band and they were making a demo and that his money was tight but maybe he could do a payment plan and I said I could do that. And he said “Okay I’ll be in touch,” and I said “Okay.” And I thought this was just a guy coming to buy a painting because I had pretty much decided I was gonna be single the rest of my life and live in that apartment with 25 cats because I’ve had some BAD experiences. Umm, so sure enough he called me and he came over and we did four installments. And he called me on Presidents weekend and said, “Umm, can I give you the third installment this weekend?” I said “Sure.” And then he said, “Oh and I don’t know you’re around or if you like flute music but my friend is playing a flute recital and I have no one to go with. Would you please come with me?” And I said, “I actually used to play the flute so, sure!” And at this point I still had no idea I had just been asked out on a date. I thought it was some heavy metal guy who didn’t know anyone to go with to a classical concert. Until he picked me up and realized- said he wanted to ask me out for a long time. And then I’m like, “It’s a date! Okay!” And I can tell the rest of the romantic story or just let you know that’s how we met. But.. Okay so we went to the concert, his friend actually played umm, a Jazz piece, where I had actually played two of those pieces in the past.. It was a big coincidence. Umm, It was a beautiful sunny day like two days after it had snowed so it was like you had the freezing cold snowy day, now you’ve got those gorgeous winter days that are warm and sunny and the snow’s on the ground. And we were on the east side, the show was over, we decided to walk across the park back to the West Side. Got to the middle of the park and all of the snow turned into slushed and there was this giant puddle of slush- like huge, and I was wearing nice shoes. So he carried me over the puddle. Umm, when we got back to the neighborhood, we were having such a nice time he said, “You wanna come over for dinner? I could cook you dinner.” I said, “Okay.” He goes, “Alright so give me a couple hours and I’ll get the ingredients and then come over.” So I went over, he cooked me Thai curry and we just went from there. It was just beautiful. And that woman actually played flute at our wedding. Me: Wow… That could be a movie (laughs) Meredith: Stupidly romantic.. (Laughs) So wonderful. Me: And what does he do for a living? Is he also a- well I know obviously he’s into music. Meredith: He was. He was in various bands and so he always supported his music by working in restaurants and then like me, you start to get to an age where it’s you know- you’re not famous yet and you need more money and he was actually really good at what he did because a lot of working at a restaurant is performing. And he has a great personality with people and he’s a salesman and a showman. Umm, and he just started getting better and better at it umm, and so after we were- well we weren’t married yet- no it was after- yes after we were married he started working for a big restaurant corporation that gave him a lot of management training but they were working him to the ground. And he was miserable and we never saw each other. And I said “Okay look, if you loved what you were doing, I’d let you stay. But you hate it, and we don’t see each other. It’s not worth the money, let’s find you another job.” And we read about something in the New York Times and we had no idea where it was and he went and he reviewed (think she meant interviewed there…) and got the job as an Assistant Manager. It’s a restaurant called Michael’s and it’s a big entertainment industry, media hangout. It’s second restaurant that Michael owns, his first one’s in Santa Monica (CA). So it’s meant for people with the Bi-coastal life. Umm, and after about a year there, umm, he really didn’t get along with the manager cause he was very energetic and he could see how to make things better and he was always offering suggestions and everyone there was sort of like, “If it’s not broke don’t fix it dude. Just calm down.” And he’s like, “Oh but we could be doing this and (makes random noises).” So he went in one day and little did he know the manager was about to fire him, but when Michael heard that, Michael instead fired the manager and kept my husband. And he’s grown to now be- he’s been there 20 years and he’s the general manager and the CFO. Basically Michael’s right hand. And that restaurant is basically filled with umm, modern art. Famous modern art so it’s sort of… Me: So you’ve never exhibited any art in the restaurant before right? Meredith: No I don’t think I’d be allowed to umm Michael’s wife is also an artist so she’s got some things up there next to the Hockney's and Duvencords and you know not really… We’ll see. Me: And so how did you- Oh yeah and coming full circle right? How did you find out about this program? And how did you meet Natalie? Meredith: I didn’t meet Natalie. Umm there- the director of our studio Tony Bavielia- I don't know where he was- he was at... ughh and I should know because he did email me where he was but he was somewhere where he heard her talk about this program so he went to her and talked to her about the Abingson square Painters. And said, “You think this could be a fit?” And umm, she said absolutely. And so he emailed all of us and said, “I’m going to do this.” He actually also lived in Q Gardens so he really fits. And umm, said “If any other of you want to participate, here’s Natalies information reach out to her directly. And you know it’d be really cool if a bunch of us were cataloged together as- because of the group.” So I don’t know actually who else is doing it, but I said “Okay we’ll have to do this.” Me: Okay I feel like we’ve covered a lot. You’d agree? Meredith: Mhmm (nodding her head) Me: Well I appreciate it. Meredith: Sure. Me: And thank you so much for your time. Meredith: My pleasure, my pleasure ",
  "Nuseir_Rami_timecode.txt": "The American Mid-East Leadership Network originally aimed to empower our youth in Astoria. However since we opened our doors for services we�ve had different kinds of people come through here because the services are needed. We realized since the economy was hit badly we focused on financial education, financial literacy, job readiness, resume-writing, job-hunting - things that can really put food on the table. A lot of the recent immigrants do not understand the job market in the US. They do not know that there are procedures; you look for a job, you send a letter and your resume, you have an interview - you have to be prepared. For each of the stages you have to be prepared. In the Middle East you tend to get a job by calling up and saying �my uncle told me to call you, give me a job.� That�s changing, but for most people who come here to use our services come here with zero knowledge about how to job-hunt here in the US. And of course most don�t speak English at all. We do ESL classes three times a week. I�m a lawyer. I was Legal Counsel for a bunch of non-profits. After 9/11 I realized that Arab youth are very lost. There is serious conflict between the two personalities � Middle East and USA. So we started with empowering these youth. However in 2002 I was in Jordan and a friend of mine who works with the American embassy said can you give a lecture about Arabs in America after 9/11. So I went to one of the prominent schools there and gave a lecture to about 80 students, high school kids, and I realized how misinformed they were about us; the same way that the general mid-western American society is misinformed about the Middle East. A lot of middle easterners in the Middle East think that here we live in cages. That after 9/11 people are following us with rifles and want to hunt us and jail us. I started thinking about how that could change. So in 2003 I started American Mid-East Leadership network. One of its programs is to build mutual understanding between the Middle East and America. We did a program with Syria - Grassroots diplomacy. The idea of that is for people to learn first-hand, away from the influences of politicians or the media, away from those who are partial and let them see for themselves the reality. We did it 5 years ago in Syria. Last year I went to Libya and unfortunately we were meant to be there May 22nd we were supposed to fly there but with all that�s going on unfortunately that didn�t happen. However, we have created a new program called \"My Galilee\" which will educate Americans about the Arab Muslim and Christian population in Israel. We�re going there on July 31- Aug 13. We�re trying to educate people � university level students. We try to diversify the group as much as possible. This group I have a white guy, a Hispanic, oriental, a white girl, Colombian, Pakistani. I�m trying to show that America is not a homogeneous society. We are a multi-cultural beautiful fabric. You sit in this caf� and every table has a different ethnicity. It�s so gorgeously diverse in Queens and Astoria. Here in Astoria the Middle Eastern community is predominantly North African: Moroccan, Egyptian. Not many Palestinians. I was born in Palestine, in Nazareth, my beloved city. That�s why we�re taking people to the Galilee we�re going to focus on Nazareth. I came to New York about 13 years ago. I lived in San Diego for a while, then London before that for six years, before that in Belgium. So I�ve been living in different places! But I hope that New York is my final destination. It�s just a unique place. It�s different to any other place that I�ve travelled and I�ve been a lot of places. This is home for me. When the plane lands at JFK I feel that I�m home. Egyptian revolution on Steinway: Absolutely there was homesickness. It was such an amazing spirit to be on Steinway that time. One of my staff members speaks Spanish. So I said record something in Spanish regarding what�s happening. It�s so amazing to be part of this history. Since November I�d been to Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria. Some of my friends were joking that I had something to do with it! They said Rami, what did you do. I said that I was privileged and lucky to visit those places just before the revolution. I love Tunisia and Libya. You couldn�t sense that something was going to happen. When I was in Libya and Syria I was a part of an official delegation. Libya is one of those mysterious countries that for the general American public, is not open for tourism. So for me to go there and spend a week�I met with very high level people in the government � you can�t get the green light from the universities, they�d do the program but you have to go through the government. I worked for about a year prior to going there in building the project. We hope that the people will be strong enough and rebuild the countries, inshallah. I go twice a year to Nazareth. I love my hometown. Being Christian myself, which is a minority I always try to be connected. My mom is there, my family is there. It�s important to connect, not to disconnect. I�m so proud that I�m taking a group of students to my hometown to start an initiative between students here and there. I�m very excited about that more than anything else because I�m taking them home. It has a different feeling. They�re going to have a blast; they�re going to learn a lot. The programs I build they are educational programs so they�re not going to be wasting time, they do their homework. The main misconception is that we actually exist. Many people do not know that there are Arabs living in Israel. They don�t know. And what�s important to me is to educate the American public that there are Arabs in Israel - there are 1.4 million Arabs, of which 1.5% are Christian. I don�t think that the Israeli government or the American government or anybody who works on the peace process is giving the Palestinians living in Israel justice. They can really do a lot but we were never given an opportunity. Even educating Arab-Americans about the Palestinian population of Israel. The moment they hear Israeli they kind of shut down and want to hear nothing about it. I say no, �you�re going to listen to me; you have to listen to me.� Most challenging is fundraising - funding, funding and funding. I rely on individuals. I have a small staff and we�re so focused on delivering the work. I�m always looking to collaborate with other orgs in Astoria � to join efforts, to do something together. The Arab community is not the easiest community to work with. Look what�s happening in Egypt and elsewhere. These people lived under repression for much too long. So when they come here, the challenge is to educate them more than anything else. When I advise them on free health insurance with United Healthcare or insurance plus I say �I�m going to give you free health insurance�. They way �why, why and run away.� When you do a seminar and you don�t charge a nickel they get scared. So the education process has been difficult. So taking into account what they went through, where they�re coming from. A lot of Arabs come from a tribal society so when they come some place they need to know somebody. They�ll say �I know somebody from my town, or village, or city who moved to America 30 years ago - I�m going to look him up. Or �I�m your neighbor�s 15th cousin, and they will open the door, they will help.� Some are tired and just want a better life. Some come because they won the green card lottery. A guy from Morocco he was working for Mercedes and making good money. He was married and with a kid and very financially stable. Then he won the lottery. Suddenly �America� controlled his way on thinking. And he moved to the US. He regretted it because he�s working as a waiter somewhere. We tried to help him with work, but again, language challenges, navigating the system etc. It�s managing disappointment as much as anything. A lot of people are unhappy politically, socially, so there�s the draw of the green card. When I get people jobs, or to get their papers or to go to school, that makes me happy. Also, getting people together: we promoted the QUILL event [Queens in Love with Literature event on June 18 2011, �Cairo Connections: One City, Many Voices�], found the location etc. At the same day there was a music event, our event, celebrating Egyptian dancing at the Queens public library on Broadway � dancing, shaking it and having fun. That same day at Queen�s public library on 21st street we had an event about education. That makes me happy, the result. Taking a group to visit the holy land. Something tangible. When I see the smile on people�s faces. We also host in our office a group of Egyptian intellectuals who met on Twitter and we give them our office space to meet and talk. We try as much as possible to be inclusive. I wish we had more people and resources. The climate for Arab-Americans is getting better but we still need to do more work. One problem is that our community is very divisive and territorial within itself. You know, I can say that Moroccans might not like the Egyptians; the Egyptians might not like the Palestinians etc. There�s a myth about the fact that we are all Arabs - we are not. We are 22 different nations, 22 different cultures, we speak the same language but we are very different. So of course that Egyptian will take care of his interests. When I met with the Egyptian counsel general I offered to do a program with Egypt. He did not welcome the idea. I was disappointed for a diplomat to be that way. But every community protects its own interest. One point I�m very careful about is we�re very secular. We are not influenced by any religion. We welcome everybody, and zero tolerance for racism. We�re also starting Arabic classes in Astoria, for 10 people. A few years ago Mayor Bloomberg announced the week of July 9-16 is the Arab heritage week of New York. Last year we did the first Arab Heritage Week Festival of Astoria on Athens Square. About 2000 people came. There was music and dance and vendors and blah blah. It was WOW. This year we were supposed to have it July 19 but we decided to do it later in the year, after Ramadan. It will be in September. We face a bit of resistance even from our community. There are people who have a conservative view of things so putting together music and dance on the street isn�t very appropriate. My answer to them is �welcome to America.� We are not provocative, people are not dancing nude. It�s very cultural, very respectful. I think thank you for your opinion, but Queens is the most diverse place in the United States, and we need to celebrate our culture and heritage in this city. Athens Square is a private NGO (George who�s the chairman of Athens Square). When I first came here I really liked the community of Astoria. I love the Greeks, the Latins, the Russians, and the Brazilians. It�s really nice. In Manhattan, especially when you work there, it�s very robotic. Here you can still sit and chill and enjoy things and walk from one place to another. And there�s no need to go to Manhattan. There are restaurants, coffee shops, bars, schools. Close to Grand Central, Trioboro Bridge, BQE I mean it�s a great location. Everything is accessible. Hopefully in the summer when I come back I�ll bring my mom; I miss them, it�s nice to have family nearby. In the Middle East the concept of privacy is almost non-existent. Here people like their space more. I love the Middle East but I would not live there. They do it with love. They want to help you, feed you, take care of you, however it can suffocate you! We have a beautiful, hospitable, warm culture, very different to here. Here there�s a great culture too, just different. I moved out of the Middle East when I was 17. Now I�m 38. All of my adult life has been abroad. We have a very big house in Nazareth, the family. Astoria is like a bottle of wine. The older it gets the better it gets. I really think so. On May something we had the National Arab American Service Day. We brought about 100 volunteers and cleaned Astoria Park. Peter Vallone Junior came, and lots of organizations came. Grand Caf� is great: good value for your buck, food is great, inside and outside, nice crowd, good location. When I have people coming from out of town I say Grand Caf� has a Manhattan feel. When I talk about Astoria I talk with passion. ",

Didn�t feel afraid growing up, neighbors looked out for each other. Always felt part of city, not afraid to take train home. First job in Rockefeller Center at 18 - �a thrill,� near NBC Studios, exciting, but prefers living in park-like Flushing. Dad was custodian of PS 111 (LIC). Theft of family�s �57 Chevy --her only memory of crime. 00:43:16 Shopping � During childhood: King Kullen (sister started working there - still with company), Waldbaum�s on Kissena, other stores, great bakery (Larby�s?), banks nearby. Now: Parking difficult, congestion. Fewer American supermarkets and products, mostly Asian bakeries and shops. 00:48:15 Language problems in neighborhood. Too many Asian shops and restaurants lack English signage; used to patronize Asian bakery but no longer feels welcome, no signs in English. This discrimination �disturbs me,� it�s not welcoming. Didn�t used to be the case � all ethnicities used to feel welcome; past 5 years or so things have changed. Earlier Indian population spoke English, blended in. 00:55:17 St. Mary�s Nativity Catholic Church: Church is hurting as congregation diminishes and ages. More families sending children to public school since church school now charging higher tuition. Some racial diversity � some Indian and Chinese parishioners. Partnering with St. Michael�s in some ways, combining resources. She questions validity of some churches begun in (former) private homes � some have run into legal trouble. 01:02:08 Cultural differences can create tension. Some, like public spitting, are �disgusting�; she sometimes protests when she sees it happening. More people riding bikes on sidewalks � illegal, dangerous to pedestrians. LP pulls flyers off lamp posts (leaves ones for lost dogs). Sometimes local politicians come to Waldheim meetings; these kinds of issues brought up � she hopes some improvements may be made. She saw fewer neighborhood tensions with earlier wave of Indian immigrants. 01:15:12 She and sister wanted to leave (traffic, attitudes) to be near brother in �pleasant� community of Glen Oaks. Loss of job put off plans. (Disk 2 starts here) 01:20:25 (00:00:57) Would be best for Waldheim to cap further development. �Too late for Cherry Avenue.� 01:21:36 (00:02:10) Flushing Commons � Mixed-use development will add beauty but also congestion. YMCA to be relocated there. 01:23:15 (00:03:45) Flushing movie theaters of past � RKO Keith, Prospect; Roosevelt (later became UA Quartet) was farther away. Keith had been beautiful, landmarked theater; illegally destroyed by new owner in 1980s. 01:27:35 (00:08:05) Library � She used it more when unemployed; borrowed DVDs. Size, services �amazing� � Chinese cultural center, computer classes, children�s section, language tapes, CDs, etc. for many different cultures. 01:30:35 (00:11:07) Shopping different now. She used to shop a lot on Main Street, now rarely shops locally for clothing, �not much left.� 01:34:23 (00:14:53) No real Flushing identity in 1960s, 70s. Some accent differences, use of �stoop� is a Queens/Brooklyn thing. 01:39:28 (00:20:03) Waldheim: Old McDonald�s farm was real and located here. 01:40:00 (00:20:32) Shea Stadium � Family drove or walked over Flushing Creek to get to Mets� games when she was a kid. �Bleacher creatures.� Cost about $1/ticket or free with milk carton coupons. Could take food to game, lots of special promotional days. 01:42:58 (00:23:80) Milk in glass bottles delivered to apartment door in crates. Delivery people took empty bottles back. Didn�t get newspaper delivered; now mostly reads local papers. 01:46:47 (00:27:12) Mom started working in school lunch program when kids were older to help out family finances. 01:51:07 (00:31:35) Local butcher shop � kids sat on bench and got free baloney slices. Luncheonette with counter next door. 01:53:56 (00:34:31) �Remember when� is common but �more so around here.� �Destination place for a lot of Asians� so Flushing�s too crammed. 01:54:45 (00:35:16) Family went to Coney Island on Saturdays.

  "Padilla_Tom_timecode.txt": "Tom Padilla was born in Queens and grew up in the middle class suburb of Bayside with his mother, uncle and grandfather. He is part of a series of oral histories of Queens College alumni, collected by Queens College. In this interview, Tom tells the story of being a single child raised by a single working mother in the 1960s. He speaks on the little he knew of his absent father and the hole that absence created when he tried to understand his Puerto Rican heritage which ultimately led him to websites like “Ancestry.com” and “23 and Me”. Tom discusses his journey through different jobs, and even that time he volunteered for Assembly member Nily Rozic. Tom has spent almost the entirety of his life in Queens and currently lives with his wife and his old English sheepdog in Bayside. As a longtime resident of Queens he prides himself in the fact that Queens is just as much NYC as the rest of it. 00:00:51* Tom grew up in middle class suburb (Bayside) neighborhood in Queens near Long Island Railroad, many buses no subways. Raised by a working single mother, lived with grandfather and uncle, many kids on the block. 00:07:34 Public school for Kindergarten (nearby), Catholic school (4 blocks away) for 8 years. Quiet and shy as a child, prone to being bothered sometimes even bullied by other students. Known as a “sports fanatic” by 8th grade graduation. 00:13:04 Asked about father role in life, but had no comparison. Very clear that there was a grandfather and uncle in the house, but didn’t know what a father figure was. 00:13:54* Tom’s mother was youngest of four, brother George who was 8 years older, brother Jim 9 years older, sister Margaret 11 years older. Tom hadn’t met his grandmother. Would hear stories about them and how the grandparents would parent the children. 00:14:38 Tom’s grandfather was a cop, New York Police Department, Emergency Service Cop for 35 years. Retired when he (Tom) was 3 years old. 00:18:55* Raised by mother during the 1960s. Learned to always follow the rules. 00:20:27* Grandfather was fun, a “man’s man”. Very muscular, different jobs; longshoreman, built houses, policeman, worked in a factory in College Point when he was in his early 20s, played football semi-pro/sandlot football in early 1920s for the “Warlo Athletic Club”. Grandfather knocked out teeth playing football. Younger days grandfather was adventurous and tough, traveled the country, went cross-country on a motorcycle. 00:22:40 Grandfather had 9th grade education, asked Tom for support. Taught Tom appreciation of history, encouraged a lot of reading. Mother also didn’t read often, but had friends that taught and helped Tom learn how to read so that when he was in school he was ahead in reading. Mother played different roles; father, mother, friend, sister, etc. 00:25:25* Mother would only bring up father in negative ways, but only in passing. Would say “sure, walk away, just like your father”. When Tom was 52 & 54 he asked his mother about his father. Mother was a “good catholic” never remarried, never got a divorce, sought an annulment but the church wasn’t cooperative. In 2015 Tom learned that his father’s mother refused to sign some kind of paper that would’ve allowed the church to investigate the charge of abandonment and allow the proceeding for the annulment. 00:28:57 Father’s mother named Cristina and a brother named Jaime. Tom asked in 2015 about father-did she love him at any point? They got married at their church. She said she couldn’t remember. Tom asked if her father had raped her and she said no. She couldn’t recall if she ever loved him. They had a small basement apartment in Flushing and he would start disappearing, a few days at a time then for longer. Grandfather stepped in and said she should move out and live in the house she had grown up in. She was still pregnant when she moved. Grandfather tried to facilitate a reunion to at least get child support. Bank book from 1960/1961, mother said that Tom’s father paid a few installments of child support and then stopped. 00:32:22* All of Tom’s mom’s friends from Bayside all wound up with “Mr. Right” with a “good guy”. Some moved out the suburbs and they would visit them out in Long Island or in New Jersey. She would stay in touch with high school and elementary school friends, but then they started to die on her. Mother lived to 77 and most of her friends died before her. Eventually mother started drifting and started feeling abandoned by friends. In 2007 the last of her siblings had died so she was alone – no husband, no siblings, no parents, only nieces and nephews who weren’t always there. She got a little depressed. 00:34:35* Tom met wife in 2008. Mother passed in 2016. All three had a good relationship. Wife lost her mother at 20 to cancer. Tom’s mother had a soft spot for people who had lost their mothers at a young age. Tom’s mother went to live with Tom and wife in 2015. 00:36:24 Interviewer (Walter Saavedra) ask’s what it meant to Tom that his father was Hispanic? 00:26:27* Tom thinks a lot about it. Thanks to Ancestry.com and 23 & Me, and DNA tests, Tom was able to create a family tree on his father’s side. He’s able to be in touch with folks that seem to be 2nd or 3rd cousins. Father’s family was from the Western part of Puerto Rico, “Cabo Rojo”. Learning surnames like Ramirez, Ferrar, and Mattos. Tom has always identified as Caucasian, then Caucasian non-hispanic, and now Caucasian Hispanic but still confused. Based on DNA tests he know’s he has about 30% DNA that comes from the Iberian peninsula. Mattos might be more from the Portuguese lineage. Took 3 years of high school Spanish. 00:39:36 Still doesn’t know if he’ll ever inhabit his Puerto Rican heritage because he has no connection. Doesn’t know what he wants from the family tree except to complete a story. Keeps going back in family tree to find where he gets indigenous native blood. Mother’s side is European and southern European. He says he’s white “the whitest guy he knows”. 00:41:35* Tom sent an email to the President (Felix V. Matos Rodriguez –a noted Puerto Rican scholar and has been part of Puerto Rican government) of Queens College. Tom has a BA in English from Queens College (1985) introducing himself as he searches for an “intellectual father” to help him understand his heritage but hasn’t been able to tap into. 00:43:38* Tom says that when he saw the president’s name in the news, specifically the surnames: Matos & Rodriguez, he was proud. Proud because it looked like names on his father’s side of the family tree. Momentary recognition of something. Tom points out that his family’s been in New York for a long time and that usually it’s Irish or Jewish names that are signed at the bottom of the diplomas, like Murphy or Walsh (Mother’s name). Nice to see someone with a name similar to his (Tom’s) family’s name graduate from Queens College. Wrote this email to the president the day of this interview. 00:46:32 Walter Saavedra (interviewer) asks what Tom feels about Hispanic people. 00:46:38 Depends on the person! Says Tom. He hopes he doesn’t see color first. Walter Saavedra say’s that Tom forget that he (Walter) is Hispanic. Tom says that he actually thought Walter was Indian. Tom says that Walter, during an “in the Vaults” event, talked passionately about being an immigrant and that moved Tom. Tom says that he doesn’t want to be that person that says “some of my good friends are Hispanic”, but has had one or two. Raul Arroyo is one of those who he met at a one-time girlfriend workplace. They talked about literature and almost moved in together. Raul had a thick accent, but you could understand him perfectly. Raul would talk about Peru about the political situation, about when he used to live in Peru. Currently has no friends that are immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries (except to an extent, Walter Saavedra). 00:50:23 When Tom sees the names of some of his online cousins through 23 & Me he sends them a small email to see if they may have common ancestors. Some of those still live in Puerto Rico some are moving to the U.S. Has one online cousin that was moving from the Dominican Republic to Texas, they exchanged emails through website. Tom read Junot Diaz, great Dominican author would like to read more, specifically Puerto Rican literature. Goes back to emailing the Queens College president and asking for literature recommendations. Even asked if he should travel to Puerto Rico maybe to San Juan or even to Cabo Rojo. 00: 53:04* Walter Saavedra, interviewer, asks what is the reason for the curiosity to travel to Puerto Rico. Tom says he’s always been curious—doesn’t know if it’s an ancestral call to go to the motherland. He’s thought about visiting Europe too, Ireland, Germany where his DNA comes from too. At some point his second great grandparents or third great grandparents in the middle of the 19th century made the trip to Newtown Township, the section that became Corona. After living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for some years. We just don’t live long enough to explore our history. Third great grandmother born 1820 died in 1920 six months short of being 100. Died in Corona, used to live near what is now known as Park of the Americas. Now it’s so different. All the old houses are gone, there’s astro-turf and a baseball diamond. Tom says he thinks about Germany about Ireland, England where his mothers-mothers-father’s family came from in the 1830s to settle on Long Island from Kent, England where they were stonemasons. Tom has a second cousin who he met through Ancestry.com who recently passed. His wife is a Mormon and they both have a lot of curiosity about geneology also. They went to England and went to Parish churches and took photographs of records that belonged to their common ancestors. Eastons living in Pembury, Kent England, Southeast England. Tom says that he’s curious about Puerto Rico because he’s also curious about England, Germany, Ireland. Tom says that his ancestors had all been immigrants at some point from somewhere else. 00:59:34 Tom says historical record shows that there were 7 big family groups that were born out of different parts of Africa. If you go all the way back there might be 7 common ancestors to the population of this world. 01:00:25 The people that were here before anyone else, the Native Americans. The Mattinecock who came to Long Island, the Lenape, the Delaware Nation, etc and even before them and the migration that led them out here, there might have been more indigenous peoples that got here. We don’t know. Tom says he’s just curious, he’s just trying to learn about himself to find himself. 01:02:10 In the 1970’s the show Roots came out. Got a lot of people interested in their geneology. 01:02:32* Walter Saavedra asks if Tom found himself. Tom says yes, says that his grandfather used to say “I know where I am, I know where I’m going, I know where I’ve been” he was talking about hippies. Tom says he knows where he is…and who he is. Walter asks Tom: “who are you?” very assertively Tom says he’s “Thomas Anthony Padilla, resides in Oakland Gardens, Queens New York City, New York, United States of America, Earth”. Walter says that’s not him, that’s just the places where he lives. Tom agrees says that it’s not him but it gives him a sense of who he is, gives him a place to start. Tom says there aren’t a lot of places he could see himself living in if someone said that he couldn’t live there. If there were a forced relocation he wouldn’t have a “home” would feel displaced. About 100 years ago people were born, lived, and died in the same place. Now things are changing so fast, people before didn’t really have options to move around, there weren’t even that many cities. 01:06:30 Tom writes when he can’t explain a feeling. Tom says he and his wife are planning to buy a vehicle to travel the northern United States and maybe Canada. They don’t like warm weather don’t like humidity. Tom’s wife traveled a lot more when she was a teenager and in college, more than Tom ever did. He didn’t go to camp in the summer, didn’t go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, Tom always stayed in the neighborhood. Some people would say that he’s lived a sheltered life, but would argue that’s not the case. You can go wherever you want to with your mind. Not in a transmigration way, not in a mystic way. “If you can dream it be it” 01:09:14 Tom has friends in California, hasn’t traveled west of the Mississippi. Traveling, the experience, is good. Likes to think that he’s not rigid, not stuck here in Queens. If finances were to allow he would go somewhere, would travel. He still wants to have a homebase, a hotel, an RV. Doesn’t know if he could…live in a small town like Wichita, Kansas. Tom’s wife might want to move to Maine, Tom open to it. 01:11:40 What is friendship for you, ask Walter Saavedra. Friendship is everything, you can’t it with you like material goods says Tom. Tom says hopefully one day he’ll be able to look back on 3 or 4 friendships (apart from family) and say “oh I lived, time to go”. Tom’s mom encouraged Tom to have a lot of different friends and different hobbies. Friendship to Tom means memories and having experienced a common life. Two people who were alive at the same time and shared that time together. Tom’s bestfriend hasn’t lived in NYC since 1996, now is in California, but they talk all the time. Tom says he wouldn’t be as rich as person without his friend and his partner who both live in California. All three have known each other for 22 years or something like that. Tom has friends that he’s been friends with since he was 4 years old. 01:19:38* Tom talks about Assembly member Nily Rozic, she’s great. Young man doorknocking and ends up at Tom’s door campaigning for Nily. Tom didn’t know much about his representatives so was open to hearing from this young man. Tom had just left a job at CNN that he’d had for 12 years where he wasn’t allowed to work for, contribute to political candidate, nor express political views in an open forum. If you did you might get disciplined or even fired. He had left that job a few months before and was now interested in getting involved in a grassroots campaign. Tom wanted to fight for something. 00:34:38* Nily didn’t have that much experience except working for a city council rep in Manhattan doing the outreach. Nily was a Townsend High School graduate. Tom wanted to volunteer and was interested in the campaign. Even went to Nily’s house for a phonebanking night and made calls to people that live in the district who were registered as Democrats. Did it for a few months, a couple of days a week, but he liked it! He had just gotten knee surgery and wasn’t looking to get a job that quickly. Nily won that campaign by 500 votes and won again multiple times after that. He hadn’t been involved in politics before and was hesitant of politicians because he knew many were unethical and corrupt, especially in Albany. Working Families Party contacted him a few times after, but Tom wasn’t interested. Tom says he’s waiting for another candidate that would get him motivated and would make him feel comfortable. Tom wishes he were more involved and thinks it’s important to be an engaged citizen of this country. 01:30:06* “Half of America doesn’t even vote, but my (Tom’s) grandpa took him into the voting booth since he was 7 or so. Would have me pull the levers and everything.” Imprinted in Tom that voting was important. 01:31:20* People that volunteer with political candidates usually have a history of being involved or come in through unions. Tom is happy that Nily is in Albany. Saavedra asks how Tom know Nily as a person and as a politician. Tom says he doesn’t really care about someone being “progressive” that doesn’t mean anything. Tom appreciated that Nily was interested in doing public good and fought for improved bus service. Tom says it showed him that Nily cared because not a lot of other politicians would care about the buses. 01:34:50* Tom says that you can become complacent when you start hearing about policies that don’t directly affect you, especially when policies come from Albany. Tom says he wants to care more and listens more closely to hyper-local news either on Facebook or on local newspapers like DNA Info and Patch Bayside. Tom would read articles about issues closer to home because “all politics is local”. Local news, community news is important. 01:36:06* Tom speaks to changing demographics in district, in Bayside. Says that Nily had at least one volunteer that could speak Mandarin Chinese and maybe Cantonese because the district is over 50% Asian and a percentage of them are able to vote, they’re an important demographic. The other candidate didn’t care and in fact the wife of the other candidate disparaged non-English speakers. District no longer predominantly Italian-American. 01:39:24* Tom points out that folks that have been in the area will look down on new immigrants for not being able to read or speak English. Xenophobia is common, not always, but happens. Politicians will use fear to their advantage sometimes and prey on the fears of the constituents. Nily was born in Israel, lived in Argentina and speaks Spanish. 01:43:04 Tom sees himself as a writer. At one point had a handful of poems published, they were about policing. Would take poetry workshops and was sad when he didn’t take any workshops. It’s now over a year since his mother has passed. Tom is in the process of writing a story based on a family story. Tom likes writing fiction. 01:45:20 Tom has given himself until Sept. 1st 2018 to have a book proposal. Something that would interest and agent to sell to a bonafide publishing house. Tom is focused on researching and writing. 01:47:05* Tom is asked who he is by Saavedra. After a long pause Tom says he’s a man. A heterosexual man in a monogamous marriage with a woman he loves and a 75 pound old English sheepdog, living in a two bedroom apartment. Tom also likes to think that he’s a “good” man. Thinks in terms of good and bad, he learned that from his mother and catholic teaching. However he’s not “black and white” because he sees shades of grey. He is a moral relativist [laughs]—what’s good for one person is not good for another person. 01:50:33 Walter Saavedra asks if Tom likes adventures. Tom reacts hesitantly and says that depends. 01:52:00 Tom identifies himself as more risk-averse, but sometimes he surprises himself. 01:55:19* Tom started going to the YMCA and working out. Prevent health problems. 01:58:23* Walter Saavedra asks how Tom thinks immigrants have influenced New Yorkers. Tom says that there are two types of New Yorkers: some that have lived in one of the five boroughs for more than one generation. They usually do work in service or public safety like policing or firemen. Then there’s the young people that graduated from college and moved to New York. Tom says we’re all from somewhere else, unless we’re not. We either came from another country or another state. We all have to get along, we don’t have to love each other but we have to be civil. 02:02:10* There are new people to New York all the time. There are New Yorkers that have been here for a long time. There are New Yorkers that want to help those new people and there are people that don’t help. Sometimes New Yorkers help, but sometimes New Yorkers don’t need help. 02:03:47* When there’s something big happening, like something happens on the subway the people who respond and who don’t are mixed, sometimes people are drawn together and forced to interact. Tom doesn’t think New Yorkers as a rule are intolerant, if anything Tom thinks that New Yorkers are more tolerant of any ethnic or religious background than in other places. There are troublemakers, there are people that are on medication, and there are people that need someone to explain to them what’s wrong. Those people have generally not been raised to respect other people. 02:06:05 Tom says everything is on camera nowadays. Bad people that need to be made accountable for their hateful actions. If someone attacks someone for being Muslim or does anything hateful to express hate, that needs to be dealt with. Tom says police get a bad reputation—some police are good some police are bad. 02:07:58* Walter asks what is Queens for Tom. Tom says Queens is home, Queens is New York City not Long Island. Queens is parks and cemeteries, world’s fair grounds, and Citified (used to be known as Shea Stadium), the New York Mets, and airports. Tom says that Queens can have a generic feel. Sometimes people overlook it and just refer to it as Queens, not specifying the neighborhood. Tom points out that Jamaica to the early Dutch settlers was called Rustdorp, found that out a couple of weeks ago looking at the history of Jamaica. Tom says that this space (Queens Central Library) gathers people, books, and resources. Tom says libraries (he’s worked at libraries and at news libraries) are at the center of communities. Tom says he feels safe in a library, not that he feels threatened anywhere. Feels like he’s at home when he walks into a Queens Library. Queens Libraries gather a diverse population for the purpose of learning and sharing information, which gets Tom excited. Tom likes when libraries are open 7 days a week, and when they are open 12 hours a day. Tom says library cut-backs are bad! A lot of Tom’s friends are libraries and he respects them a lot. Librarians are important because they’re cataloguing everything and making things accessible to the community. 02:13:26 Tom asks where the interview lives once they’re done? How is it a part of Queens Memory? 02:01:41* Walter says: Queens Memory is a project that tries to understand people from Queens and learning about their lives at different points in time. Walter’s particular interest is to know what a “New Yorker” is and what a “Queens” resident is. Walter wants to know what people in Queens feel and think. 02:15:25 Tom is curious about interviewing Walter, but more interested in Queens Memory—what can he gain from it? Tom knows Queens Memory through its Facebook account. Tom reached out to a Queens Library archivist because he wanted to buy a map. Tom has wanted to see the archives for almost 30 years. Tom has known a few people that have worked at the Library. The last time he came to the library to just sit down and read was in 1996, and was consumed by poetry. 02:18:26* Tom only started driving, really driving, 5 years ago. He can get to the Central library really easily taking the Q30, he used to take the bus to take him to the Long Island Rail Road or the E & F. Tom has a friend (Ben, who he’s known since college in 1980) that works the circulation desk at the Langston Hughes library in Corona, Queens. That friend used to work for Tom when he managed a book store. Tom says the Langston Hughes library is a real jewel and he wants to go and surprise his friend one of these days. ",
  "Palacios_Adelina_timecode.txt": "Born in Mexico, Adelina Palacios has lived in Queens since she came to the United States after marrying her husband. She wanted very much to work when she arrived in the United States. Adelina soon become very involved in her children’s school activities. She narrates this interview from the point of someone who has immigrated to the United States. 00:00:19 Adelina Palacios studied in Mexico for Executive Secretary and also a bit of accounting. After completing her studies she worked as Accounting auxiliary in the company of beers known as \"Corona.\" She was highly regarded there, she lived quiet and had the love of a good family. One day she met who would be later her husband through the sister of him who worked with her. He, who had already been in this country, was to collect his sister and both of them offered to take her to her house, which she accepted. From that moment they (Adelina and her future husband) began to date and then came the courtship that lasted three years. Adelina was aware that he wanted to come to New York where he had his siblings, but she had no intentions of coming. They felt in love so much that they got married and suddenly he asked her: \"why don't we go to New York? We could see how is going to us, if we do not like it we can come back.\" That was the start. She arranged her tourist visa and when he came, she followed him after three months. So began the story here: arrived to the brothers of his husband’s house. She came as all immigrant does: without knowing for what is really coming, without knowing what she was going to find. First thing she did was to study English for understanding people: \"being here I wanted to go to school.\" Only after studying English she was thought to be suitable for looking for a job, and it was one near the house where she lived. 00:03:29 Eight years after of being here, she got pregnant and seven months after her first son was born, she became pregnant again. However Adelina continued working during pregnancy until her children were born. His mother came from Mexico for looking after the children while she worked, but at three in the afternoon she came out of the work, she was going to pick them up from school and taking charge of them. After eating they were going to the library. 00:04:20 Adelina did not know so much English in that time. She took a simple course in the school. The tasks of the children were not simple for her because she did not speak English. In the library there were teachers who helped her children with their tasks. Back at home, children watched TV awhile and went to sleep early... Adelina worked in a bakery, she went to her work at six in the morning, and she got out at three in the afternoon. Her mother gave breakfast to the children and took them to the school after which she was going to New York, to meet some people and to make their own occupations. Her mother went to a Senior Center where she taught weaving to people. That was her routine until the children came to Middle School. Adelina was always investigating the operation of the school and the activities that her children had there. 00:07:00 Adelina liked to learn and to know about all things... Since the children were in third of primary she was interested in belonging to the Association of parents of family, and a good day she was appointed Treasurer. With her friend, that was the President, she went to the meetings of the Department of education. She went to conferences and meetings to which very few parents of family went. She points out that if one is not aware of the children and of the performance that they have, they will not have success. By that, now that her children are in College she has its rewards... In the conferences of parents at School, many of them came out crying because they knew that their children they sent all days to the School did not attend... Adelina was informed about the performance of the children. Once, she learned that one of her sons was lowering the notes despite having perfect attendance, but it was a funny case of two children and their mothers that had the same names. The issue was arranged because the children were after that identify by their IDs and not by their names. 00:12:10 Although the advisors advised not register the children so far away from their houses, her son wanted to go to a school in Manhattan. There the Principal explained, in an open house, starting of the course, how functioned the School and that by being a small School he knew to all the children by their names: he was an authority, but he was also a friend of the children. There were in that place much respect and a good environment. Adelina liked it very much that she managed the transfer of his other son to the same school. It was easier for her, since this time, handle all things related with her children and their school. 00: 14:20 Adelina’s eldest son decided to go to a College in Long Island and, after that, to one in Manhattan to study Psychology. The other child went to a College Fair where a lady, that was giving the applications for private schools, told her that her son could go to one of these with a scholarship since Adelina had no money. The son filled the application for the NYU, passed the interview and passed the exam, then they gave him 80% of the expenses and the rest the child would have to look at other institutions, which he did successfully. Now he studies at the Business School through the Education opportunity Program. 00:16:00 Adelina came to this country that she never imagined to arrive, that was not very difficult for her, but neither was very easy. Raising her children where they are now has been a challenge for her. Her husband worked in a pizzeria from 10 am to 11 pm, and by that time she was in charge of her children… She has said that only after eight years of being here she thought she was prepared to engender children. Since a young age she knew that she had to prepare for that moment, because it is not a as to say \"I brought them, now I will let them grow up as they can\", but it is a constant concern for caring them, educating them, making them good persons... and now they have succeeded. That is the best gift for her. 00:17:40 When Adelina came, visits to Mexico were very sporadic, at the beginning, and when they began to arrange the papers it was no much time at all. In that period died her husband’s father and mother, almost one after another, and he could not go to none of those two events. Her husband felt in a strong depression. Those were very difficult times that had to be overcame gradually. Adelina told her husband that if he wanted to go to Mexico when his parents died, they would know how fix that later. He did not want to go because he knew that his parents would think the same way than him. 00:19:08 Adelina always was helping in the Association of parents of family and she had already two years going at a College for studying English. She is repeating her studies: first the GED and then she will seek a best work. One day her children told her: \"you already did what you had to make by us, now we will support you, because never is too late for having an education, so now you must reach your dreams.\" 00: 21:17 Adelina found in this country that to learn English was the most difficult thing, and also how to move in the transport system. After five years she adapted to their new way of life... In Mexico she had a comfortable life, although she was not a wealthy woman. She walked to the suit, the shoes with the sachet. In Mexico she was impeccably but everything here was different, the change of her life was very hard... Here the work was different... everything was. Her first work was in a deli that sold food: she had to wash the ovens for the roasted chickens and there she cut and burned her hands constantly. For her to leave her family in Mexico was very difficult: she missed them as well as she also missed the work that she had. Today she can say that everything was worth because her children have responded very well. But, although the years have passed she miss her place, her villages, her family, her traditions... 00:23:52 She says that this is a fabulous country. Everyone who comes here and wake up can achieve very nice things. 00:24:06, Today Adelina is working in a shop where she sells fruits and vegetables, there she has met many people of all races, of different professions, and like that. She has always lived in this neighborhood of Queens where everyone is known; she always went to her children’s school and participated, where she spook with all the world: the police, the person that was in charge of the cleaning, the Principal, the teachers... And she thinks that that is perhaps a way of not missing her own country. 00:25:37 For Adelina, this his is the third year that she goes to York College to study English. She is recalling what she studied in her country. She has the support of her children. They say: \"you did it before for us, now we have to be proud of what you're going to do.\" She always liked to be Teacher Assistant because she likes school, children and all that. 00:27:02 Adelina’s husband does not have sequels of the depression... but only when he is sad. The day before this interview was done, her husband received bad news because an uncle of the son of his sister died, and he was a close friend of him... When it arrives news that make him remember his parents’ death, he puts a little sad, but it was not the same that when they both died. She does not give him the news without doing that he is prepared before... Regarding that last event, when her husband received the news only asked \"how?\" and did not say anything else. Her son, that studies psychology, said that that reaction was not very good because he had saved all to himself. But after, when he was watching the television, he was chatting and he acted normally. The loss of a loved one did not discouraged her husband: he has never stopped working and he has kept his mind busy. 00:30:05 In the eight years that passed before having children, Adelina accustomed to being here, in a country with another way of life. In that time her husband and she worked so much. His brothers and he himself bought a pizzeria that her husband served and he had no day off. The life of both was only to work and they saw themselves just at night, when they returned home. The day Adelina had free, she prepared food and took it to the pizzeria where they both ate. When her husband’s sister was here, Adelina went with her to some artistic shows in the Madison Square Garden. It was an easier and less expensive life, they could move more easily and went to some restaurants and then to the pizzeria at the time of closing. All was so monotonous... For some festivities, as Thank Giving, all the brothers met at night and the day following they returned to the routine of always. 00:32:00 Adelina is from Oaxaca, where the people are different, the habits, the foods. In Oaxaca people are more loving, families are more united... Her husband is from Puebla: they are always observing how the people is wearing, while in Oaxaca people is more simple, for being of the coast they do not have to walk well dressed, they are walking with shorts and sandals... the people is looking more in details. The food is equally different... In Oaxaca its people is more active, more for business, in Puebla instead the people when accurate money they do not puts themselves to make cakes for selling because they think in what is going to think the neighbor if they make that. In Oaxaca It doesn't matter what the people can say. 00:33:55 Adelina is more impressed for the great opportunity that exists in this country for people who come, which does not exist in our countries. In Mexico there is an age limit that women have presentation for being young and if not they are not supported in any work. That would be its own case if she stayed in Mexico. While in this country what is worth is the knowledge, how one is unfolding. If anybody comes here is not to be with the arms crossed and waiting that others do something by one because no one makes it... She came with the set table because her brothers-in-law were here for years and had their own apartments, so she had it all, but she initially told her husband: \"I am going to continue working here, I'm going to continue to be whom I am and if I have the possibility of getting ahead, I will do it...\" Her first job in Oaxaca was in a law firm. The second one was in the accounting of a pharmacy: a Professor of hers recommended her, and then the same professor helped her to enter to work in \"Corona\" brewery… Adelina was a resolute woman and always was replacing (without payment) any employee that is out for holiday, so she was knowing the particularities of the different works of the company. To the marriage she resigned although the manager did not want to accept it... She left everything and that was very hard for her. When she got here she always remembered all that, by that was that she almost always said to her husband \"I want to return to Mexico.\" Her husband answered all the time to her: \"we are already going to return\" but they have never returned. 00:40:33 Now, her children ask them their plans for the future. She says that she is studying while is still working, and her husband says that he has not thought: \"perhaps we will return to Mexico by a time.\" The children say: \"what are you going to do there? Things are not well.\" 00:42:27 Adelina says: \"when I offer my friendship, I really give it of heart\", but she knows that not all the people do the same thing and that one can get many disappointments considering someone your friend and then you know that they are not. \"I can count my friends with the fingers of my hands, I mean: those who have been really my friends, those whom I can count in any moment, in whom I can trust unconditionally… the others are only cafe’s friends\" \"I do not know if I am wrong, but in this country it is very difficult to get friendships.\" Those persons who say they are your friends, they are always asking something in exchange, while in our countries friendship is more sincere. \"I have friends that I knew since childhood and we are friends even today,\" and they keep in communication themselves. Adelina feels that here people is more suspicious by the same things that have passed to themselves, perhaps people are not bad, but whom have made damage to them made them be so. \"In this country one loses that humanity that we bring from our places.\" She says that she has not had negative experiences, but unconditional friendship is not easy to find in this country... Of course, in any country is very painful to be unconditional friend. 00:46:10 Where Adelina is working now, she has the opportunity of knowing people of different cultures and she can notice the differences between people, perhaps by that she feels that the Hispanic are more open and expressive than the Asian whom repress to much their feelings (they are not very affective, they are very dry). She likes Queens for its diversity of cultures. 00:48:10 Adelina’s friendship with Sonia Soberats was born because they are neighbors and they were trying very closely. Adelina appreciates her friendship to much, and learns much of her. She admires her. Sonia is blind, but she always manages very well, even when Adelina precise orientation of how getting to some place in Manhattan, Sonia says it to her... Roxana helped to his son with mathematics in a time in that the teacher was ill and could not give him classes for the tests that was approaching. 00:50:20 Adelina speaks of how got USA tourist visa in Mexico. 00:51:40 Adelina speaks of her childhood and the games she played, in many of which were involved all the children of the neighborhood. She and her friends of childhood recall “those times that are never going to return...\" In that time when the mother said \"come home\", children obeyed, now you say to children that is not already time of seeing television and they begin to shout, and if one wants to call them attention or give them a slap, they threaten with calling the police. That makes the difference of why people of before were more healthy that people of now. She mentioned the difference in education since children today have calculator or internet that tell them all: they no longer use the head... The education of the child in the house depends on the father, both here and in our countries... She would have liked that all parents worried about their children since that would avoid that she was concerned about how their children's friends were... His eldest son is now 21 years old, but until a year ago he said where he was going. She considers that it is very important to maintain good communication with the children. Now that they are men if they spoil it is fault of themselves, as she says to them. 00:58:07 Adelina’s fears in the school and in the University have always been drugs, alcohol, women. She talked about these issues to her children. They knew that everywhere there were those dangers, and they knew how to avoid them. She always advised them, but she left in freedom and they were whom decided. 00:59:24 In Adelina’s neighborhood there are all sorts of children. She knows her children’s generation. Some goes to College, but others are in jail or they are not doing good or legal things and that, as a mother, gives her much sadness because she know them from childhood. They had too much freedom, their parents did not worry about them... There was no communication. 01:00:53 Adelina speaks of differences that perhaps are among people that were born here and those who came illegal when they were children and they did not fix their documents, preventing them to continue their higher education because many benefits are denied them. 01:03:00 Adelina says that now, in election time, she must be deciding by a candidate and she does not know who is the best, but all that she wants is that the best wins because this is the country that manages the whole world. The mentality of the candidates is very different since one wants to help immigrants and the other does not. This country, she believes, is of all people who live here, as it said by her countryman Jorge Ramos: here everybody is immigrant, everyone is following the same American dream, it does not matter the country of origin. We are all coming to treat of being better than we were. If we leave to win a candidate that does not want immigrants \"what is he going to do with us?\" The fight is going to be more difficult, more difficult has to be our situation in this country. We are here for giving a good education to our children. 01:04:22 Adelina believes that the American dream is to be prepared, working hard for having knowledge, for fighting the battle for better life. We must not treat of living to coast of another person, but to coast ourselves. 01:05:17 We are seeking our own welfare when we get to this country, unfortunately there are some people who do not matter by passing over others to get up, and they are selfish because they have the form of helping or teaching others and do not make it. There is no solidarity in the people, even when they are of the same country… it is clear that \"I can only speak of my own country…\" She has seen Chinese and Hindu people working hard and helping each other: they buy a business among ten people and then they continue working until all they have their own businesses... Adelina says that in her country people are always criticizing or envying someone who gets what they do not have. We should be united as the Asians that are helping each other to realize their own dreams... Many Latin American people are limiting their need here for sending money to their country for helping their families. This is the reason why they don't eat well and many times get sick. They send money to their countries, by doing that people think that here the money is won in an easy way and that is not the truth… 01:08:56 The Hispanic community has grown so much but they do not like to learn English, since they don't need it in supermarkets, on the bench, in the mail and in hospitals. But that is a great mistake: we need English because in many parts of this city everybody has to speak it... Adelina says that when she came to this country she only knew a few words of English and, at the beginning, it was very difficult for her to work because customers spoke English and she did not understand them, especially when they were claiming something. “One became frustrated because you didn't know how answering.” That gave her so much courage and said to herself: \"I'm going to learn English, at least for defending myself when someone is attacking me...\" Here, we are in Queens, where there are people of many nationalities and you cannot communicate with them if you don't know English… When she began to go to the Association of parents of family meetings, she already knew as a 70% of English, but always had a friend to whom she could ask if she did not understand something: but she knew that that could not be all the time that way, she knew that she had to learn English for being self-sufficient. 01:13:20 When one of her sons was in primary, he played saxophone and in the School orchestra each father accompanied children... After each presentation the teacher of music came up to congratulate parents and children and he gave them a hand, but a girl from Bangladesh was banned for its culture to do it, which was very respectable, and she apologized for it... Adelina says that she was knowing that cultural differences go that way, and she has learned so much from different cultures: good and bad things. 01:14:56 Hindu women are humanitarian and friendly and they cooked with spicy, as Mexicans. When there was meetings between them, each one took food from the own country and the Hindu made a very rich desserts. The food of every culture is very different in accordance with the spices that are used, said Adelina. Mexican used much spicy, Colombian likes beans, Peruvian chickens are delicious. Although she has not almost eaten much the food of others countries, but she loves Italian, Chinese and Korean (that carries many vegetables). 01:17:25 Adelina does not speak much about her husband. He is very quiet, reserved. If one asks him something, he responds what he wants, he does not answer what you have asked him... For his depressive problem he does not had any therapy: \"I am a person very believer, I'm Christian, very practitioner of the Bible. We have the gift of prophecy. When a person prays, the Lord can speak by the lips of that person. The Lord has made me many beautiful promises, one of which was that we did not worry for nothing of what has happened to my husband because the Lord was healing him. So he has changed a lot, now he is a very different person, but he did not need a psychologist or psychiatrist. I can say that that God is helping him.\" In her Church they are not fanatics, nobody prohibits them do things as they have free will: we can go to a party and take a drink if we are invited, the problem is to exceed in drinking because that is something contrary to their faith. She says that the free will is the liberty of expressing or do what you want. She is a believer and she admires God, respects and fears him, for that reason she will never criticize people for doing things that are not correct for her: \"now I am happy, I am doing what I always wanted to... I never thought to come to this wonderful country, but I'm here and here my children were born. They have raised and are boys of whom I feel very proud because are good children and citizens. I strange too much to my family in Mexico, but I am very happy in this country at this time. I do not have still arrived to the goal that I wanted to, but there I am…\" She know although that all could change, but so far her children are going well and she is happy.",
  "Paltooram_Odelmo_timecode.txt": "FDNY EMS worker, Odelmo Paltooram, was among the first rescue workers on the scene in the Rockaways the morning after the devastation and destruction of Hurricane Sandy on October 29th, 2012. Here, he gives us a candid recap of the first day after the storm and what it was like from a first responder�s point of view. 00:00:22 EMS/ Fire Department for NYC workers are contacted through 911 computer system, work along side Army National Guard during emergencies 00:01:16 there were still active fires in the morning hours 7:00am. Resources were pulled from other emergencies/citizens to work the fires. 00:02:00 Set up security detail near Crossbay Bridge. Streets still covered with sand and mud. Ordinary emergency vehicles unable to maneuver the streets needed Army Humvees. 00:03:15 Night of Sandy, there was no way for them to respond to the 911 calls because the major roads were flooded. The trucks were unable to get in to fight the fires at Breezy Point. There was a standing order to �just rescue� people. Goal was �Life over Property� 00:04:20 In vicinity of B102- B105. Boardwalk is gone. Water receded quickly but 6-12 inches of sand blanketing the neighborhoods. Sanitation came in to cart the sand away. Cars moved hundreds of feet, stacked on top of each other. Pieces of Boardwalk traveled 300 plus feet inland. Cars windows smashed from people trying to escape their vehicles, bus stop glass shattered. 00:07:27 After the storm, when there was the gas shortage in Queens, some people tried to siphon gas from their storm damaged vehicles. People were boarding up the houses because of wind damage. 00:07:51 Along Rockaway Beach Drive, near B116, Many store fronts burned down during the storm. If EMS workers had a reason to believe that a person was trapped inside they would�ve tried to get into the buildings. Buildings burnt so hot that the metal beams were bent and melted. This was a few entire blocks in each direction. Fire Marshalls responded after to survey damage. 00:08:59 There are many displaced residents with no place to go, who were placed into shelters on the mainland. Queens College became one of many temporary shelters. 00:10:01 There is still the smell of burnt wood and debris from the fires, and it is still smoldering in places. Drove up and down in the Military Humvee, to ensure no fires restarted. Small flare-ups were put out immediately. Complete devastation. 00:12:13 Water in the Rockaways was contaminated after the storm. Sewage spilt over into the water plants. Residents couldn�t drink the water from their pipes. 00:13:08 Going towards Breezy Point through Belle Harbor was still difficult the next day since there was 2-3 feet of water in the streets. Military Humvee (made for this type of driving) having difficulty. Breezy Point�s main road [Rockaway Point Blvd] still flooded, water pumps attempting to clear the water from the streets using the same lines that would have been used to bring water in to fight the fires, it took several days. Also did this for the residential homes in the area as sitting water can create an unsafe living environment. 00:14:07 Playground that was once fenced in near Atlantic Ocean, now surrounded by water and sand, on Devon Walk and Oceanside Drive. 00:15:52 In many homes sand washed away from underneath concrete foundations causing them to sink into the ground. 00:17:24 Lots of people stayed in their homes. Water caused more problems than the winds, and kept emergency vehicles from responding to calls. Once the water came in (between 3 and 8 feet in places) residents tried to leave but were stranded in stalled vehicles. 00:19:29 Breezy Point community is known because of the many firefighters that lived there that were lost on September 11th, 2001. 00:20:07 Breezy Point homes were originally vacation homes, converted to year round living. Streets are narrow, only 4- 5 feet wide, which does not allow for emergency vehicles to have access. Flood waters made it completely impossible. Blocks in flames looked like a giant bonfire, near Olive Walk and Devon Walk. The same lines used to try to put out fire the night before, now used to pump water out of Breezy Point. 00:21:58 Local residents have put up an American flag on the frame of a storage shed. Extremely close community - Neighbors helping neighbors. 00:25:04 Power wires down are on the ground, the poles not as strong as they should be. Propane tanks scattered everywhere. Most homes ran off propane, few gas lines installed. Fireplaces are what are left of most homes. Personal belongings are gone forever. Entire blocks are unrecognizable. 00:29:03 Homes that were 10 feet from fire had siding melt off but stayed intact. Fire Engines only got as close as Rockaway Point Blvd. 00:31:12 Life Alert for elderly, works off of electricity, unable to be used because of power outages. 911 was unable to get to anyone needing medical attention during the storm. Residents were unable to use telephones. Many people lost their lives because emergency responders were unable to get to them. 00:33:51 Water remained in the low-lying areas of Breezy Point the day after the storm. Homes pushed inland, sinkholes created from waters. 00:35:20 Help (Humvees) came from the Bronx National Guard that arrived to Fort Hamilton within 8-9 hours from as far as Buffalo, NY. 00:36:00 Hi-Rise buildings/ Apartment buildings with no power, needed EMS and National Guard to carry people out/perform patient care, rescue, carried supplies in. 00:39:24 Memorial Bench for firefighters that perished on 9/11 sustained no damage from the storm. 00:40:27 Emergency workers gave up their days off to assist in the efforts in the Rockaways, and helped out the local emergency workers who had lost everything. Everything had to come in from the mainland. 00:42:01 Because of massive power outage on the Rockaways, travelling at night was immensely difficult and dangerous. Army provided gasoline for First Responders throughout the gas shortage. 00:44:32 North of the Belt Parkway in Queens didn�t experience the destruction from Hurricane Sandy that the Rockaways did, sense of disconnect around the borough. Northern Queens went back to normal quickly while the Rockaways still devastated. 00:46:12 Flags are being put up all along the Rockaways. 00:46:24 In Riis Park, Sanitation was trying to cart all of the sand out of the way to help responders get to areas in need of help. Fire Engine Company 286 gets stuck in the sand. 00:47:58 First rows of homes facing the ocean seem to have sustained the worst damage from the storm. All along the coastline there is damage of varying degrees 00:53:11 Emergency response workers and the Army National Guard rescue victims of Hurricane Sandy and pick up supplies for FEMA and the American Red Cross to distribute to those in need. 00:53:38 The Rockaways showed no signs of being a modern day community. People were cooking over open fires in garbage cans, no recognizable signs of city living. Originally drove around in canopy Humvees, which had to be replaced with armored Humvees due to random gunfire. ",
  "Park_Pauline_timecode.txt": "00:00:03 This is a Queens Memory Program interview with Pauline Park, at 67-71 Yellowstone Blvd., Forest Hills, NY. It is March 12, 2018 at 6:25 PM. 00:00:51 Pauline was born October 24, 1960. She was born in Korea and adopted at seven and one-half months by European American parents. Her father is a second-generation Norwegian-American and her mother is a fourth-generation German American. Pauline grew up in Milwaukee and lived in the same house from the time she was adopted until she turned 18 years old. 00:01:35 Pauline attended South Clement Ave. School, Fritsche Jr. High School and Bay View High School, in Milwaukee. She graduated high school in 1978. She attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During her fourth year of college, Pauline studied abroad in London (1981-1982). She then completed her master’s degree in European Studies at the London School of Economics (1982-1983). She spent five years working and then went back for her Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. 00:03:02 Pauline spent 17 years in her childhood home in Milwaukee. She then lived in Madison, but always wanted to live abroad. She had an opportunity to study abroad in London. She studied in London from 1981 – 1983. London is a gigantic, world city and very different from Milwaukee and Madison. After studying in London, she came back to the U.S. and lived in Chicago (1983-1988). Pauline then lived in Champaign-Urbana for five years while working on her Ph.D. During this time, she spent two months in Berlin (1990) at the time of formal unification; she was in the crowd of two million people and strode through the Brandenburg Gate at midnight when reunification was celebrated in the Tiergarten. She returned to Champaign-Urbana. She then spent a dissertation year (1991-92) in Europe, living in Regensburg, Germany (summer 1991), Brussels (fall 1991) and Paris (spring 1992). She returned to Champaign-Urbana and finished her dissertation. She then taught for one-year at a college in Lake Forest, a suburb of Chicago. She then moved to NY, living on Staten Island for a year and one-half. Her final move was to Queens in 1997. She has lived in Jackson Heights since January 1997, in the same apartment. 00:07:37 When Pauline was living in Staten Island, she was looking at different neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Even in 1997, Brooklyn, was too expensive. She looked in Queens and found an apartment in Jackson Heights. She was attracted to Queens and Jackson Heights, in particular, because she was already organizing in Queens while living in Staten Island. She had been invited to help co-found Queens Pride House. Jackson Heights is the epicenter of the Queens LGBT community. Queens Pride House moved there in 2006. Queens is home now, and Jackson Heights is really home. 00:09:11 In the past 20 years, the neighborhood has gotten more diverse. Every year it is a little more LGBT. It has gotten more expensive because of gentrification, but it is still reasonable compared to other areas in NYC. Not only is it the most diverse neighborhood in Queens, but Queens is the most ethnically diverse county in the United States, and in the world. There are about 84 different languages spoken at home by students attending PS 69. There are 167 languages spoken in the borough. It is the only one of the five boroughs with a majority immigrant population. This makes the neighborhood so attractive and stimulating. There is wonderful food including the best Indian restaurants in the City. Pauline lives near the Little India Section (2 block stretch of 74th Street, between Roosevelt and 37th Ave.). There are Mexican and Columbian restaurants. There is a great health food store on 37th Avenue. There is a profusion of different things to see and do in Jackson Heights and Queens. 00:12:01 Pauline lives in a standard, six-floor, brick, coop building. It is well maintained. What she loves about her apartment is it has hardwood floors. The most noteworthy features are a piano, and many books (looks like the Stand bookstore). Pauline grew up with music but had not played the piano for 25 years. About 10-11 years ago she decided to play the piano again and bought an upright piano. She tries to play every day. When Pauline and her brother were seven years old, they were given the choice of a vacation or a piano and they chose a piano. They took piano lessons. Pauline’s mother was very musical. 00:15:02 Pauline owns her apartment. When she moved in, she was a sub-tenant. The landlord was a shareholder and a crook. The coop board foreclosed on the 12 apartments he owned. It was an unexpected opportunity to buy the apartment at a discount. 00:15:58 Pauline co-founded Queens Pride House in January 1997. There were preliminary meetings in the summer and fall of 1996. In January 1997, they met at Elmhurst Hospital and considered that meeting the founding board meeting. Pauline is one of two founding board members still involved in the organization. Seven to eight LGBT activists in Queens wanted to start a community center. Manhattan had one, none of the other boroughs had one. They felt it would be nice not to go to Manhattan and would be good to foster a sense of LGBT community in Queens. The City is very ‘Manhattan centric’ and this is particularly true in the LGBT community. Queens Pride House was the first effort to establish an LGBT Center in the outer boroughs. 00:17:43 In the fall of 1997, Pride House had an office in Queens Borough Hall. They then moved to a store front in 2001 on Woodside Avenue, between 67th and 68th Street. The storefront was across the street from a laundromat, and Chinese and Korean Christian churches. There were no issues from the neighborhood. There was only one incident of anti-gay graffiti during the entire time the Queens Pride House was there (in 2001). It was a storefront with glass windows right on the street, saying LGBT Center. 00:19:09 In 2006, the Center moved to their current location on 37th Ave. in Jackson Heights, 2nd floor (76-11 37th Avenue). Pauline was on the Board from 1997-1999, 2001 – 2004, and again since 2010. She was elected President of the Board in 2010 and served as Executive Director from May 2012 to July 2015. 00:20:24 The biggest change in 20 years is that Queens Pride House now has its own space and paid staff. When Pride House started, it was all volunteer. Their first grant was from New York State to start a referral program that is still operating today. It is Pride House’s oldest funded program. It refers clients to LGBT supportive health care, social service providers, lawyers, and other service providers. Pride House ensure that the referrals are LGBT friendly. If there are no appropriate referrals in Queens, clients are referred to Brooklyn and Manhattan. 00:21:40 The biggest program now is the condom distribution programs. Pride House distributes 50,000 condoms a month in western Queens, a crucial aspect of HIV prevention. 00:22:05 Pride House also runs support groups. Pauline has coordinated the transgender support group since February 2011. It is one of the most vital aspects of Pride House’s operations because it helps change lives. Every meeting, the group helps people across the gender spectrum come out and identify their gender. The group includes transgender people, transsexuals, cross dressers, and gender queers. Other support groups in the City say they are open to everyone, but Pride House’s is unique as it is really gender-queer friendly. Other Centers are more gender specific and more focused on medical interventions. The Pride House support group is non-directive and non-directional and provides a warm, supportive environment for people to explore their identity and find resources to help their gender journey. The group helps with many issues – families, partners, marriages, children, parenting, and reproductive issues. Other issues include coming out, coming out on the job, transitioning at the workplace, families, street harassment, discrimination, police harassment, and brutality. The group is very diverse, both demographically and in gender identity. It has a majority people of color which is also unusual. It is vital and life-saving work. 00:27:11 One member who transitioned through the group was suicidal. She went to the George Washington Bridge. With help from the group, she pulled back from the brink. The group saved her life. 00:27:58 People come from all over the borough to attend the group. They also come from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and NJ, because it is such an open group. 00:28:26 When Pauline was Executive Director, she organized a series of public forums. This helped bring people to Queens Pride House from within and outside of the LGBT community. They co-sponsored a forum on diversity with the Diversity Project. The forums covered expected and unexpected topics. After the Edie Windsor Supreme Court (same-sex marriage) victory, there was a forum on the future of LGBT rights. Other forums included HIV AIDS, and path-breaking topics such as police-community relations, human trafficking of Asian women in Queens, and the Israeli occupation, which drew the ire of the Queens Chronicle. Pauline thinks that LGBT community centers should engage in controversial political topics. Not many do so, denying the discussion of important issues. 00:33:30 The transgender community is unusually fragmented in terms of age, race, class, immigration status, needs, challenges, and languages spoken (non-English speaking). Some are sex workers (some by choice and others because of few economic options). Reaching all the elements of the community is a challenge. Pride House does it reasonably well but could do better. For example, they are located a few blocks from Little India but do not have a large number of South or East Asian clients. 00:36:35 One of the ways Pride House reached a lot of people in the past was through their mental health program, which they are considering reviving. They had a staff person who supervised social work students. They recruited students from social work schools, such as Hunter College, NYU, community colleges, private colleges, and Columbia. The students provided counseling for members of the community. It was one of best programs and a major service to the community. 00:38:08 Queens Pride House has provided public events and fun events (Valentine Day parties), open houses during the Queens Pride Parade, and an annual benefit event to celebrate anniversaries of Queens Pride House. 00:38:00 In 2002, Pauline founded the Guillermo Vazquez Independent Democratic Club of Queens. The Club operated until 2004. She thought there needed to be a political club in Queens that was independent of the Democratic Party organization. There was another LGBT Democratic Club connected to the party machine that Pauline did not think was speaking for the community. She brought together a number of people. They had a successful launch, covered by the NY Daily News and Newsday (Queens edition). Their events drew capacity crowds. (Pauline then described an event that she remembered was actually through Queens Pride House, 2001.) There was public forum on diversity, focused on women and people of color running for elective office in Queens. The event managed to bring together a number of interesting people, many of whom won races for office - Helen Marshall, former Queens Borough President, John Liu, the first Asian American to win office in 2001, and Hiram Monserrate, the first Latino elected to public office in Queens. 00:43:06 The goal of the Club was to bring together really interesting people, spark some good interactions between the LGBT community, candidates and incumbents, and make sure LGBT issues were on their agenda. There was a real commitment to progressive politics. There was internal conflict in the Club and it fell apart. It lasted two years but had an impact. 00:44:05 At the same time (2001), Pauline was involved in co-founding Out People of Color Political Action Club. This was the first political club by and for LGBT people of color in New York City. Doug Robinson (gay African American), who was a member of Stonewall Democratic Club, felt that Fernando Ferrer was not getting a true hearing from the LGBT Democratic Clubs (Stonewall, Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats GLID, Lambda Independent Democrats of Brooklyn) while running in the 2001 Mayor’s race. The three other candidates were white. The Club endorsed Ferrer and for a few years the group had an impact. Pauline became co-president. In 2001, they endorsed Julia Willebrand, the Green Party candidate, for mayor. This was controversial. In the beginning, they had to decide if the Club would be a Democratic club or independent and they narrowly voted to be an independent, non-partisan club. 00:46:54 Pauline has been involved within and outside Democratic Party politics. She thinks there are serious problems within the Democratic Party. According to Pauline, the Queens party machine dominates the politics of the borough. It is not always advantageous for the LGBT community or communities in color to be in lock step with the party. One of the issues is the structure of primary elections in NYC, requiring petitions. Petition gathering gives the county-based party machine an inordinate amount of power over candidate selection. Insurgent candidates rarely win. There is a very high rate of incumbency in New York for the State Legislature. 00:49:16 Pauline spoke at a forum in January 2018 with the Queens Anti-Gentrification Project. Gentrification is a serious LGBT issue, as LGBT people are getting priced out of their neighborhood. The forum occurred before the City Council speaker election. At the forum, it was discussed that the Chair of the Queens Democratic Party has named all but one Council speaker. It happened again in 2018. Even though there is an openly LGBT speaker of the City Council (Corey Johnson), Pauline does not believe that this guarantees progressive or independent leadership. Big money interests have a disproportionate influence on public policy. The existing party machines are plugged into and can co-opt various communities, such as LGBT people, women, and people of color. 00:51:54 Pauline is willing to work with Democrats. She did so when she led the campaign for the City Transgender Law in 2002 which she is best known for (discussed later in the interview). This effort involved working with city officials, mostly Democrats on the City Council. Political parties are viable only if they advance a progressive policy agenda. The Democratic Party has value only if it is working to address a progressive policy agenda. Sometimes it works against this. Pauline has the most affinity for the Green Party, but third parties do not win elections. It is always a balancing act between ideals and gritty reality. Principled people do not always deal with reality, and political operatives sometimes lose their principles. 00:55:36 In 2013, there was a lot of pressure in the LGBT community to support Christine Quinn, running as the first Lesbian mayor. Pauline did not support her. That type of identity politics can be limiting. Representation is important, but you also need structural/political change. 00:57:38 Pauline has friends and colleagues who are doing really good work. Her mentors are not necessarily based in Queens. She most admires Charlie Ober, another founding member of Queens Pride House, who has lived in Ridgewood, Queens for decades. He is involved with many organizations, including the Ridgewood Democratic Club, the Ridgewood Property Owners and Civic Association, and the Guillermo Vazquez Independent Democratic Club. She also admires Michael Synan, who works with the Queens Anti-Gentrification Project and Nancy Agabian, a bisexual writer of Armenian descent who lives in Jackson Heights. 01:00:33 Pauline stated that she is most associated with founding Queens Pride House and NYAGRA (New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy). Leading the campaign for the City Transgender Rights Law was the greatest honor and accomplishment of a lifetime. 01:01:22 In May 1998, Pauline went to Washington DC for a transgender lobby day with a friend from Brooklyn. On the drive back, her friend said we could do this in NY. At the time, there was no sustained transgender advocacy organization in NY. In June 1998, they called together seven activists and called the group NYAGRA (New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy). They met in David Valentine’s apartment. They decided to work on legislation. They focused on two areas – discrimination and hate crimes. SONDA (Sexual Orientation Non- Discrimination Act) and a state hate crimes bill were pending in the NYS legislature. NYAGRA met with the Empire State Pride Agenda (ESPA). They referred NYAGRA to the coordinator of the state hate crimes bill coalition in regard to transgender inclusion. This coalition ultimately decided not to include gender identity and expression in the legislation. That legislation finally moved in June 2010. 01:05:36 In regard to discrimination, NYAGRA told ESPA they wanted gender identity and expression added to SONDA. SONDA had been pending for 30 years, locked in the NYS Senate controlled by Republicans. When NYAGRA showed up, this became a fly in the ointment, as it had been hard enough to recruit Republicans to pass a gay rights bill. In 1998, transgender identity and expression was new and very cutting edge. The ESPA suggested an alternative - working together on a local, NYC bill. 01:07:11 They started work on what became the transgender rights bill. At the time, Pauline was a very private person and did not want to become a public figure. But as no one was stepping up, Pauline realized she had to lead, making her a public figure. In February 2000, they held a press conference on the steps of City Hall to announce the campaign. This was the beginning of her profile as a public figure. She would interact with the City Council and the media. It was a real education. 01:08:52 She did not learn how to do this through her Ph.D. in Political Science. Academic learning is not as relevant. This campaign was learning by doing, learning how politics really works. Pauline stated that elected officials are politicians and politicians are self-interested. Pauline got involved in major power struggles, including what order the six sponsors would be listed in the bill. She worked this out with Tim Sweeney, the Deputy Executive Director of Queens Pride House. Bill Perkins, African American (Harlem) was listed first then Margarita Lopez (first lesbian in City Council), then Christine Quinn, and three others. 01:12:58 A lot went on behind the scenes. There was a power struggle over who would run the campaign. Pauline and Tim Sweeney (ESPA) ran the campaign together. She also learned a lot from Tim (Sweeney) and Matt Foreman. There were disagreements. Peter Vallone, Sr. (Astoria), speaker of the City Council at the time, and Mayor Guiliani opposed the bill. What got the bill through was term limits for these two officials. Mike Bloomberg became Mayor, Gifford Miller became City Council Speaker, and Bill de Blasio became the new chair of the General Welfare Committee. Pauline worked closely with de Blasio and Miller to fast track the bill. When it came to the Mayor’s desk, it was said that Bloomberg hesitated. However, the bill had passed 45-5 and the Council would have over-ridden his veto, so he signed it. The bill passed on April 24, 2002 and on April 30 there was bill ceremony at City Hall. That was Pauline’s proudest accomplishment. 01:16:28 The outcome of the hate crimes bill coalition was different. They were not able to persuade the coalition to include gender identity and expression. Pauline worked with Ross Levi, Legislative Director at the Empire State Pride Agenda, to get the state Attorney General (Elliot Spitzer) to issue an opinion saying that transgendered people were covered under the state’s hate crime law that had recently been enacted. However, it was up to the local District Attorneys to decide to prosecute. 01:19:02 Pauline did this work through NYAGRA. The Transgender Rights Bill was the most successful accomplishment. NYAGRA was the first transgender advocacy organization in New York State. Pauline raised $175,000, enough to hire paid staff and build an infrastructure. In 2002, they had a major crisis when a staff person conspired with the fiscal sponsor to steal over $150,000 in grant funding. Loyal members of the Board prevailed, but this caused dissension and the organization imploded. Pauline was able to get more funding and re-established the organization. One learns from conflict and failure. Now NYAGRA is a much smaller organization which is not funded and serves primarily as a platform for Pauline to do her transgender advocacy work. The organization did not meet Pauline’s original vision but was the vehicle for the enactment of the Transgender Rights Law. Pauline also decided she did not want to do all the organizational fundraising by herself. From 1999-2002, it did put transgender on the map. None of the organizations in the City were talking about transgender inclusion at the time. 01:23:56 One of the offshoots of NYAGRA was a short-term project Pauline conducted with Sheila Lambert (bisexual activist) called the Coalition for Unity and Inclusion. The goal was to get all major organizations, to rename themselves LGBT. At the time in 2001, organizations were named ‘lesbian and gay’, or just ‘gay’. A number of organizations endorsed the campaign. The Center name was changed from the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, to the LGBT Community Center of NYC. It was a big deal. Name changes also included the New York LGBT Film Festival and the LGBT Pride March and Rally. The Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project is now the Anti-Violence Project. In 2018, every organization calls itself LGBT or some version of that. 01:28:11 In 2002, Pauline remembers Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Lt. Governor, say LGBT on the radio. Pauline realized they were succeeding. Now, even Republicans say LGBT; it is very mainstream. 01:29:33 Pauline continues to serve as the coordinator of the transgender support group at Queens Pride House. She is writing. Since 2011, she has been involved with Palestinian solidarity work. That is her most controversial work. This issue was not originally on her agenda. In February 2011, the LGBT Center in Manhattan banned Palestine organizing as well as any discussion of Israel/Palestine. The Siege Busters Working Group, advocating to lift the Gaza Strip siege, was meeting at Center. They wanted to do an event for ‘Israeli Apartheid Week’. They decided to rent space at the Center, strictly as a rental agreement. When Michael Lucas (Lucas Entertainment) found out about it, he wrote a letter to Glennda Testone, Executive Director, threatening to organize a boycott of donors. Testone consulted with the Center Board and decided to ban the group and cancel the event. The group was not asking the Center to endorse the event. 01:32:36 This was considered an act of censorship by many members of the community, even those that did not support the Palestinian issue. The Center held a community forum in March 2011. Pauline attended the forum. Pauline made a point about how the Center had not always been fully inclusive. 01:34:30 After the forum, Pauline ran into friends from the Siege Busters Working Group. They did not feel that what the Center leadership had said was credible. They decided to start NYC Queers Against Israeli Apartheid. (QAIA). This launched Pauline on a new trajectory, by happenstance. 01:35:36 Pauline never thought she would be an activist - she thinks of herself as an accidental activist and this work was the most accidental of all. The Center first rented QAIA a room for a business meeting, then 24 hours later, Michael Lucas said he would organize a boycott of city and state funding of the Center. The Center then banned the group. Pauline and the group started a two-year campaign to overturn the ban. They organized an occupation of the Center in March 2012. Two hundred people participated in the occupation and they received significant press coverage. There was an article in the Gay City News and the Village Voice (written by Tim Murphy). Pauline was ‘persona non grata’ at the Center. 01:37:36 Pauline then got involved in the 2013 mayoral campaign. Christine Quinn did not want the ban to be an issue in the campaign. Pauline thinks Christine Quinn pressured the Center to lift the ban which it did. Duncan Osborne, a reporter from Gay City News, called Pauline for a comment when the ban was lifted. That is how Pauline found out. People were absolutely stunned. Their campaign was only part of why the ban was lifted, it was also the politics of the mayoral election. 01:40:11 Pauline felt that it was important to have a forum on this topic at Queens Pride House. It was made clear that the Queens Pride House was not taking a position on the issue and that the forum was open to everyone. Pauline believes an LGBT Community Center should engage in the Israel/Palestine issue. According to Pauline, the backlash was extraordinary. This 2013 forum was the only forum on the issue from an LGBT perspective, sponsored by an LGBT Community Center, in the country. People are worried about losing funding if they do something this controversial. The forum was co-presented with Sarah Schulman. Jewish Voice for Peace, Jews Say No, and QAIA co-sponsored the event. No other groups have followed up. 01:43:02 As a result of Pauline’s involvement in QAIA, Pauline was part of the first LGBTQ delegation tour to Palestine, in 2012. They met with both Israeli and Palestinian groups and traveled throughout Israel and Palestine. The trip was co-sponsored by three queer Palestinian groups. Pauline met family members of Ahed Tamimi, who now, at age 17, is in an Israeli prison. 01:45:03 This involvement has been an education for Pauline related to both Israel/Palestine and politics here. It is the phenomena of being progressive for everything but Palestine. In 1998, transgender activism was cutting edge. But in 2018, although homophobia or transphobia have not been conquered, it is in the public discourse, and very few people in NYC or NYS won’t acknowledge the right to live free from discrimination and violence. Palestine is another issue – it is a third rail of American politics. Pauline was taking a risk getting involved in this issue. Pauline see herself as a human rights activist, LGBT rights are a component of that, and Palestine is an LGBT issue. 01:47:40 While growing up, Pauline never expected to be an LGBT activist. When she was a senior in high school (1977), she was looking through a book of careers, and ‘activist’ was never mentioned! 01:48:44 Pauline hopes that the LGBT community will grow and flourish. She hopes it will find more resources and have full access to health care services. It is still a long way from eliminating homophobia and transphobia. LGB people can live comfortably in most parts of Queens but there are still impediments for transgender people. Even with the transgender rights law which makes it illegal to discriminate, people still do so, and it is difficult to prove. Pauline wishes that that there would be full access to health care for everyone in the borough. If a transgender person goes to the doctor, they often have to educate their own doctors on transgender issues. Police-community relations are a huge issue for the LGBT community, and specifically for transgender people, people of color, immigrants, and undocumented immigrants. It can often be a life or death issue 01:51:15 On the ‘walk’ on Roosevelt Ave, there is known activity. If police read you as a transgender person, they will assume you are a sex worker. They go after transgender sex workers rather than non-transgender sex workers. This also happens in Queens Plaza. Pauline then told a story about a staff person from Queens Pride House who had condoms to distribute. Police checked his backpack at the Jackson Heights subway station. He looks visibly Latino. The Police asked him why he had all these condoms? When he pulled out his Queens Pride House staff ID and explained, the police did not believe him. They finally let him go. 01:53:05 The New York Police Department will often destroy condoms deliberately, including official NYC Department of Health condoms. The de Blasio administration says that they have instructed the NYPD not to do this, but there has not been much change. Police harassment and brutality are still an issue in the borough and more specifically in Jackson Heights. 01:54:34 Pauline’s hope for Queens is that it grows increasingly diverse and addresses its problems such as housing, discrimination and violence, gentrification, and political issues (the Queens Democratic machine). It is important to make the government of Queens more responsive. There is now a lot of discussion about Jose Peralta, (13th Senate District, Jackson Heights) who is a member of the IDC, working with the Republicans. There needs to be transparency in government at all levels. Representation in government is not sufficient. Any one elected to office can be corrupted and co-opted. 01:56:44 As a borough, Queens needs to overcome a lack of visibility and priority. It is the largest geographical area and the second largest population of the five boroughs, but it is a second thought for people in Manhattan. Queens should be seen as an integral part of the City, not just the airports. There is so much here, it is such a vital borough with places like Jackson Heights, Astoria, Woodside and Flushing. The diversity should be celebrated with a real recognition of the need to empower everyone in the borough, so everyone feels at home here. It should be viewed as vital, interesting and exciting as Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. 01:59:12 Pauline thinks she should write her autobiography. There are two or three autobiographical essays on her website. She wants to see more people involved and engaged. If not in electoral politics, people should get involved in community groups, beautification, the literary scene, artists, musicians, and the cultural life of the borough. The LGBT community needs more people who are willing to do the work. Mahatma Gandhi said, ‘one finds oneself through service to others’. This is the story of Pauline’s life in Queens. 02:01:09 Interview completed with Pauline Park at 67-71 Yellowstone Blvd. It is March 12, 2018 at 8:30 PM. ",

  "Paruz_Natalia_timecode.txt": "My name is Natalia Paruz, but everybody calls me The Saw Lady because I play the musical saw. The saw has a very angelic sound. A lot of people say that it reminds them of the sound of an opera singer. I like it because the sound is so ethereal and spiritual. And also I like the visual. Not only the fact it is a saw, which is kind of jarring because people don�t think that a saw would make such a beautiful sound, but also because when you play a saw the entire instrument moves in the air and makes a sort of wave shape. So visually it�s very interesting as well as audio-wise. My husband Scott composes and I play a lot of his music. I got into saw playing by chance. My parents and I were in Austria about 17 years ago. We went to see a show for tourists and in it there was a guy playing a saw. That was the first time I had encountered this instrument and I was mesmerized. I went backstage to ask if he would give me a lesson. And he said no. That was seventeen years ago. So I was forced to be self-taught. But it turned out to be a very good thing because I can say that I did it all on my own. What happened was I came back here to Astoria and I borrowed a store from somebody who had been using it for woodwork, and I was able to discover how to make a sound with it. But it could only make six notes because it was an old and rusty saw. So I went to the hardware store that used to be on Broadway and 44th Street, and I bought a new saw. And sure enough, the new saw had no rust on it so I was able to get a whole octave of notes. Throughout the years I have collected more and more saws in my quest for the ultimate sounding saw. Finally I got this one here behind me which was made in France. It�s quite long, its 32 inches long, which means it has about 3.5 octaves altogether. I moved to Astoria because my boyfriend at the time, who�s now my husband, lived in Astoria. So I moved in with him. My first time ever coming to Astoria was when I met him. I remember when I first moved here I didn�t know anybody beside Scott. At first I felt kind of lonesome because most of my friends were in Manhattan. I didn�t know anybody here or anything here. So I felt kind of isolated. But then what happened was I discovered a local newspaper that was given out for free in banks. I picked it up and all of a sudden I realized there were all these events taking place in Astoria. So I went to an event organized by the Greater Astoria Historical Society. All of a sudden I started meeting people and all of a sudden I had friends. Then I fell in love with Astoria because it feels so much like a small village where everybody knows everybody. When I went to a few different events back then, I saw the same people. Now, I have so many friends here that I hardly ever bother going into Manhattan any more. I tried busking in a subway station in Queens once. But I was approached by the police almost immediately and was told that I can�t do that. So the police are not as nice to buskers here as they are in Manhattan. Also, I know another busker who tried busking at the Steinway Street subway station, but it just so happened that at the same time there was a murder just there, that sort of put people off wanting to play there. It was just a coincidence. It�s not like people get killed here all the time. Busking on the New York subway? Oh, it�s so much fun that it�s addictive. The people, the proximity of the people is intoxicating. I get so much energy from all the people who come to talk to me. If I play on a stage, I�m up there in the lights and the audience is down there in the dark and I don�t really get to see their faces and their reactions. So it kind of feels isolated for me as a musician. On the subway I see the transformation on people�s faces as they are watching me, listening to me. And they come to talk to me, to ask me questions, or tell me about themselves. There�s this exchange of energy. It�s as if the music is the impetus for communication. It makes you feel as if New York City, which is a huge city with millions of people, is actually a small town. When I first came here, so many people warned me. You know, they said �don�t look people in the eye on the street because it�s like you�re going to ask for trouble.� And people said things like �oh in New York you can get murdered on the street and no-one�s going to come to your aid.� But playing in the subway taught me that all these things that people from outside think about New York are so erroneous. Because sometimes I might be playing the subway and someone who�s a little scary-looking might be approaching me. And I will think oh no, he might be trouble, perhaps he�s going to steal from me. And 99.9% of the time the scariest looking people end up being the nicest, kindest people with a heart of gold. Playing in the subway really taught me not to judge people by first appearances. I was born in Israel, though as a child we did travel a lot. My mother was a concert pianist so she gave a lot of concerts in Europe. And so she had to be there a lot. My father was a research scientist so he had to do research in different universities around the world. So that�s why we travelled a lot while I was a kid. We lived in different countries for a year here, two years there. That�s how I came to England one time. At first my mother kind of frowned upon playing a saw; especially she frowned upon me teaching myself, she thought that you can�t just learn by yourself. You have to go to a proper school. But what changed her mind was, she had an agent. One day the agent was coming over to our house to work with her. And I asked her if she would mind if I played for the agent. She reluctantly said oh ok, because she was so sure that he wasn�t going to like it. I played for him, and he LOVED it! Right away he said �oh, we must incorporate you into your mother�s concert. And he was so enthusiastic about my playing and that changed her approach. I was a part of her concert, and the audience just went wild. I started the Saw Festival nine years ago. When I started there were four other saw players beside myself and three people in the audience. Those players, one of them came from California. The others were from New York. The festival grew over the years to include 55 saw players and more than 400 people in the audience. So it really grew. And huge part of the growing factor is the community. The community here is so supportive. All the neighbors come. And when the time comes in July you�ll see my flyers everywhere. And all the store owners around 30All the neighbors come. And when the time comes in July you�ll see my flyers everywhere. And all the store owners around 30All the neighbors come. And when the time comes in July you�ll see my flyers everywhere. And all the store owners around 30 Places I like along 30th Ave�SAI Organics, the butchers store on the corner of 31st, and Mediterranean Foods, I go there all the time they have the best olives ever. And the fruit stand. Oh yeah, for sure, I can see myself staying in Astoria. We�re not going anywhere. We love it here. There are so many encounters every day on the subway - I put them on my blog, subwaymusicblog.com. If I was to tell one really striking encounter: I was playing at Times Square Subway Station, and there were a bunch of people around me. On one side of me was a blind man, with a cane, and you could you know see on his face that he couldn�t see anything. He was listening to the music and his face transformed into a big smile and you could really see that he was enjoying himself. On the other side there was a lady, who had nothing to do with the blind man. She noticed how he was enjoying the music. She came to me. She bought my CD. She went over to the blind man and she put the CD in his hand and she said to him, �This is the music that you�re listening to right now.� I think that was so incredible. Also this lady didn�t know him or owe him anything, and did this act of kindness to a total stranger. The saw is my main instrument. My side instrument is the bells. They�re a lot more difficult to carry! I play a set of 65 pitched cow bells. I lay them on an eight-foot long table and there�s a special foam that goes on top of the table. I play mostly ragtime music on those bells. They have a very happy sound that lends itself very nicely to ragtime music. I also play a set of English hand-bells. Those belong to Old Trinity Lutheran Church here in Astoria. I play as a soloist and also with their group. ",
  "Perrin_Keith_timecode.txt": "In the second part of his interview with Queens Memory, Keith Perrin focuses on the development of FUBU, the clothing company he founded with three of his friends in the early 1990s. He describes how the founders built the brand by exhibiting at apparel trade shows and forging relationships with up and coming hip-hop artists. FUBU helped define the �urban clothing� market, and the company�s success led to marketing agreements with celebrities such as Muhammad Ali and Bill Cosby, and even a brief venture into music production. Keith notes that the Internet and social media have greatly changed the way marketing and promotion are done, and FUBU has had to change with the times. The company�s plans for the near future include the FUBU TV channel and FUBU Radio. 00:00:43 Getting a deal from Samsung propelled the FUBU founders to move into an office on the 48th floor of the Empire State Building. They had a small space to fit the four members, two partners and four employees. After a successful first season they moved their office to the 66th floor of the building. 00:02:13 The FUBU founders credit their success to exhibiting at Black Expos. The Black Expo was held in the Jacob Javits Center in New York, but was also hosted in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. Attendees of the expo loved FUBU�s clothing and would look for them the following years. 00:03:08 Keith explains how anyone could sell at the Black Expo and the buyers could be anyone. But after FUBU�s move to the Empire State Building, they started attending a men�s apparel convention in Las Vegas called MAGIC. Everyone at this convention had a store and was buying for their stores. Many of them were interested in the FUBU line. 00:05:10 Keith started by doing sales for FUBU, which he did for about a year. As time went on he couldn't do both sales and traveling. He was traveling to promote the company�s products at events and places like the NBA All-Star Game, Cancun, and the Superbowl. He was able to do product placement on the road as well, and this became his main job at FUBU. 00:07:04 With the backing of Samsung, FUBU was able to provide samples for different people like celebrities. Smaller companies would have had difficulty doing that. People at the time loved seeing these four young businessmen making it. They loved seeing people who looked like them. 00:08:27 FUBU had many clothing contemporaries such as Mecca, Enyce, 1020 Blues, Cross Colours, and Russell Simmons' Phat Farm. The founders knew their biggest challenge was to get their clothing in department stores. If they did, it would take their company to the next level. The problem was that department stores were only looking at FUBU and not other companies. But the consumers buying Ralph Lauren wouldn�t be the same consumers buying FUBU. So department store representatives would ask them who should be next to their clothing line. That�s how the �urban� term came in for clothing. FUBU told the representatives who to surround their clothing with and created a new department. 00:10:57 In the early days of FUBU the members would ask people for help and they would say, �it�s a waste of time.� Then when the company started to become well-known, people would come and ask them for money or jobs. 00:12:17 Keith would make sales to the specialty stores. He would sell them the clothing he knew would sell, so the storeowners would come back asking for more. It built a great reputation for him. He talks about how every year they would think of new ways to make their booth for the MAGIC convention. They came up with a lot of different strategies to market the booth. One year the fire department had to shut them down due to overcrowding. 00:15:48 Since the MAGIC convention was in Las Vegas, celebrities would often be in attendance. At the FUBU booth, they always had an abundance of extra goodies to give away. They would give out clothes as well as business cards. 00:17:17 A newly released film called �Fresh Dressed� examines the urban clothing movement. It follows how the gangs of New York made their clothing through to urban clothing companies like FUBU. Keith mentions his regret for not keeping some of FUBU�s original clothing. 00:19:36 FUBU came out at the same time when a lot of famous artists were starting out. They were part of the same generation. Every year FUBU would host an event at the Dady�O nightclub in Cancun. Artists like Nelly would reminisce about how FUBU threw the best parties at Dady�O. 00:22:34 The old ways of self-promotion and marketing have changed. The Internet, along with social media, has changed public relations, and FUBU has had to evolve and adapt to these changes. In the past, FUBU would be able to make relationships with developing artists, who would do advertisements for them cheaply. These relationships were made by talking, hanging out and partying with the artists. Other brands have had to pay artists a large amount of cash to represent their clothing. 00:28:12 In 1999 Keith traveled to Japan to promote the opening of a new FUBU store. It was a surprise to see how everyone in Japan dressed like he did and how huge hip-hop was there. It was a feeling of �arriving.� By 1998, FUBU wanted to thank those who supported them, so they started giving back to colleges, boys/girls clubs, etc. They hosted a huge concert in St. Martin to thank the celebrities and press that were supporting them, featuring artists such as LL Cool J, Run-DMC, Mary J. Blige, The Gap Band and more. 00:32:14 The company created another line called Platinum FUBU, featuring better fabrics and more details. The founders wanted Muhammad Ali, Bill Cosby and the Harlem Globetrotters to represent the new line. All three promotions were successful, but Platinum ended up competing with the original FUBU line. It was still a great way to make new relationships. Keith reminisces about visiting with Muhammad Ali in Miami. 00:35:35 Keith and the rest of the FUBU founders were invited to come to South Africa to open a FUBU store in a mall in Johannesburg. Visiting South Africa was a surreal experience; they even received a call to meet Nelson Mandela. Unfortunately the meeting was canceled, but two days later they received another opportunity to meet with him. It was an unforgettable moment for Keith. 00:42:29 FUBU first got its clothing into a small store on Jamaica Avenue called Montego Bay. It was their first introduction to having their clothes in stores. They were then able to get their clothing line into Macy's department store. It was a huge success; at one point Macy�s featured the four FUBU founders in a live, interactive window display [in Manhattan]. 00:49:25 FUBU had a lot of momentum. The company helped Macy�s make its urban department, and it brought in a lot of sales. There was criticism and resistance about FUBU not being �real designers,� but they were still the talk of the town. 00:52:24 For the Platinum FUBU Fat Albert line, they first got the approval from Bill Cosby. That line was a great success, and was followed with the Muhammad Ali line. The Harlem Globetrotter line did well, but not as well as the first two. Since Platinum FUBU was competing with the regular FUBU line, they had to cut back on it and went back to basics with FUBU. 00:55:33 Decisions were made between the FUBU founders and their employees. They would do a majority vote to see which decision to follow. Keith felt blessed that many of their decisions were the correct ones. At times they had great ideas such as the FUBU/NBA clothing license, but it was too early for the times. 00:59:25 FUBU went into a lot of different markets. Their tuxedo line was the most popular for years. When they went into cologne it didn't pan out. Keith was able to see what lines would be able to do well. He knew designers like Puff and Jay Z would do well because they were into fashion, while he felt Eminem�s line wouldn�t sell well. The FUBU founders figured out early that they needed to surround themselves with the right people. 01:06:00 In 2001 FUBU started a record company called FB Records. They had opportunities to sign Ashanti, 50 Cent and Chris Brown but ended up passing on them. In retrospect, they weren�t ready to promote them. They realized that the record company wasn�t going to work because they couldn�t give it 100 percent of their time. It wasn�t their lane and they realized it and moved on. Before wrapping it up, though, the company sold hundreds of thousands of copies of the album, The Good Life. 01:11:32 In 2008 the founders felt the timing was right to put something new out. They looked into other brands and developing them. In 2013 there was a resurgence of FUBU popping up in social media. After researching and analyzing the market, the company is starting FUBU TV, FUBU Radio and various other ventures. 1:16:10 Keith talks about Queens Memory and how his coworkers are excited about it and his mother reacted so positively. He�s proud of how far they all made it. He talks about how Daymond John keeps a crazy schedule � he is now a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. 1:20:05 Keith wants to bring in quality content for FUBU TV. For FUBU Radio he wants to focus on music from 1990 to 2003. He�s excited about these new ventures. He had moved upstate to a beautiful house to be at peace, but it was too far from his workplace to travel every day. He had lived in some places on Long Island and in the Palisades area before moving further upstate. He lived in the upstate area for 11 years and while he loved it, his social life suffered. It took too long to travel. He has now moved back into Queens and is loving it. ",

  "Phillips_George_timecode.txt": "My name is George Phillips. We�re in Astoria Music. The address is 35-19 30th Avenue, Astoria, New York, 11103. The store has been here since 1922. As a music store, just the way you see it. I did very, very, very, very few changes. It is the third oldest business in Astoria. As original, location and everything. The second one is Ronzoni Corporation up on Northern Boulevard [no longer functioning as a factory at that location]. And the number one is Steinway pianos, down by Steinway Street. I started working here in 1982. I�ve been here 30 years. We sell the full line of instruments, full-line music store actually; guitars, everything, saxophones, flutes, brass, woodwind, mandolins, bouzoukis (which is a Greek instrument), violins, cellos, accessories, accordions, harmonicas, everything. Yes, yes, yes! I average anywhere between six to seven bouzoukis a month. I always have orders coming in from Greece. I order them from Greece. They�re all handmade. I�m the only music store in America that sells bouzoukis like this � well, the real thing. There are lots of imitations and stuff but this is the real thing. A bouzouki is in the guitar family�well no the guitar is in the bouzouki family�but a bouzouki is tuned like a guitar except it is one step lower. The open strings on a bouzouki are D-A-F-C, from high to low. And on a guitar it�s E-B-G-D. So the scales and formations are all the same just one step lower. And they are double strings on a bouzouki. The last two are octaves. I have played professionally for about 45 years now. I perform professionally. I�m Greek American, yes. Well there are a lot of different musicians over here so I service everybody. There are a lot of violin players, guitar players, there�s always something to do. But in general the music business as far as professional playing is has gone�live music, as far as professional playing goes, has gone down a little bit. There aren�t as many venues available in general. Throughout the whole US that is. But over here in Astoria in New York maybe it�s a little bit less pronounced but it�s still happening. It�s like slowly, slowly fading out. A lot of the clubs that are opening don�t feature bands like they used to do back in the �80s and �90s and �70s and in the �60s. You would have a band and people would come. A lot of the stuff now is artificial. It�s like the guy DJ playing music. It�s not the same thing. A lot of the music is un-reproducible. There�s a lot of junk out there. And bands don�t play that type of music. I mean there�s like 50 rhythm tracks going on, electronic, and stuff like that. And a lot of times that type of music, musicians don�t actually play, because it�s just junk. You know like two-chord songs. The quality of music, the writing has gone down tremendously. There�s not really good songs�for example, about 20 years ago even that recently let�s say, 30 years ago, in one year you would have 200 songs, brand new songs that were written by different artists. Out of those 200 songs, about 180 of them are still being played today, as standard; I mean they are still being played today - Beautiful songs. Some Sinatra songs, Billy Joel songs, Beatles tunes back from the 60s; they are still being played today. Today, you would have 200 new songs that are out right now. Big hit, whatever, they�re considered a big hit. You will never hear that song again in six months. They are dead. The quality of music has gone down. So to go back to your original question about why aren�t there bands playing, because this stuff is un-reproducible. And musicians would rather not play that type of music. There�s no quality to the music anymore. Country music is still good, let�s say, because you�re going to say �oh what a beautiful melody line�. I have yet to see in the past five, six, ten years let�s say, a song that has a beautiful melody line, to say �hey, that�s really a nice song, I�ll learn it. And I�ll give it to my band to play.� There�s nothing. All you hear is �shooka shooka shooka, booka booka booka� whatever the hell they�re doing. A lot of percussion a lot of noise and everything like that. So that�s why they opt better for DJs to do that kind of thing, a lot of house, DJ, rap isn�t even music, it�s that type of thing. What I perform is basically Greek and American music, that�s our forte. We do corporate events, we do shows, we do festivals, stuff like that. We do weddings or private affairs�we do traditional Greek music and also top 40 American, oldies, stuff like that. Changes? [To the neighborhood]�there are still a lot of Greeks around here - still a lot of Greeks. The old world�Italians, Yugoslavians, stuff like that, they kept their homes here. And that�s what�s keeping the neighborhood halfway decent around here. You know they clean their front yards, they care about their homes. They�re homeowners. People who live over here stay over here. I mean this is the greatest country in the world, in the history of mankind, this country here. Why would anybody want to go back to Greece and suffer�to go through what the hell�they are a bunch of lazy bums over there. You know. Socialism doesn�t work, end of story. That�s why they are in the pickle that they are in right now. Today is Thursday, December 1st. The euro is on the verge of collapse. It just doesn�t work. Thatcher, the Prime Minister of England said it the best�she says, �Yeah, sure, socialism, that�s the best system in the world,� it is, it truly is, and I agree with her, �Until you run out of the other people�s money.� And that�s what�s going on right there. [The US is the greatest country because of] Everything! I mean we have helped millions�I mean first of all we have liberated millions of people. If it wasn�t for this country during World War 1 or even more so during World War II, the swastika would be all over Europe. After that if you had let the Russians go if it wasn�t for this country, the other half would be Communist. So you would have three quarters of the World run by communists and fascists if it wasn�t for this country. Not only that, we have helped every country on this planet during natural disasters. They had that tsunami down in Indonesia when was it, about two years ago or something like that, we were the first country over there, we sent the USS Hope, it�s a naval hospital. We had Katrina over here. Not one country sent one penny to us. Selfish pigs. Not one country helped us. To say �hey you know what America you helped us�, you know. Not even that did they give us. And that�s why this is the greatest country on earth, because of our big heart that we have over here, and the freedoms that we have. Our founding fathers were geniuses. They couldn�t anticipate everything and that�s why they left the amendments, for it to be modified, it�s a living document. Why do people try to bust our doors to come in, why? Because of what we�ve got. If you were to say things over here and the freedoms that we have over here you�d either be in jail, your family would be disappeared or you would be tortured to death. [Bringing it back to the neighborhood, so have there been any changes?] Not really. The houses are the same. There�s a little bit more restaurants. Stores have changed a bit, a few more eateries around here. But the character is the same because of the European influence around here. It�s clean and stuff, that type of thing. Oh I love it [my work here]. Music in any form, music only makes life better. I love what I do. I used to be a NASA engineer. I was with the government for about eight years. I was being shipped all over the world. Some of the stuff was top secret; some of the stuff was design, research design, celestial mechanics, quantum stuff, mechanics of vehicles. I have two degrees in physics. But I left the government. And this was an opportunity and I was always playing music, so I bought this to be my own boss. ",

Father Piasta about the turbulent transition he felt coming from Douglaston to South Jamaica. Until the 1960s Jamaica was populated by immigrants from Poland, Germany, and Italy. In the last ten years since then influx from other areas has increased. He feels that Jamaica is under appreciated and has a rich history. ",

And yeah, I would say he's my father too. My father was very creative. So that's what at some point I was like you know I'm doing this for a living. But you know my involvement is in the arts. Melissa: Do you have any famous artists that you look up to or aspire? Christian: It Changed it changed over time and that's a good question. I think it happens it happens to everyone. I'm a big fan of Francis Bacon. But um yeah, I would say Bacon. Melissa: Ok And ummmm Was anybody involved in the military? Christian: No. No. I had to go to military service back in Argentina because it was mandatory at the time. They changed the law and somewhere in the 90s but when I was 18 everybody had to go to military service and it wasn't a dictatorship. So, I had to serve for a year. Melissa: Ok ..And what was it like in your school system was growing up. What was that like? Christian: The school system back home. I went to private schools. So, it was pretty much contained. It was mind blowing when I started teaching in the New York public high school system in NY that kept me going because it was so fascinating to me. The dichotomy from what I was used to and yeah that was a big big shock but a good one. Melissa: What were your hobbies when you first came here and now. What are your hobbies. Have they changed? Christian: I mean I don't have I don't have specific hobbies. No, I do sports I run, and I paint, and I take out the garbage. (laughs) and I recycle. Melissa: Is there anything that you do here like like when you're not working. Is there any spy you like to go to within the neighborhood? Christian: I lived in Manhattan for many years of course Central Park. And since I'm been to Queens, I like to go to the east river to look at the river yea Melissa: Do you have any fun facts about yourself or you know or the neighborhood? Christian: The neighborhood um I don't think I have fun facts as an as an entertainer but, Long Island City when I got there was still Light Industry. Uhm I found it to be fascinating. It was great for artists. There were a lot of empty places so it giving to artist for us as free space to paint. Christian: You could walk your dog without a leash. You knew everybody in the neighborhood. And it changed rapidly in the last few years and not for good. If you ask me, I don't think it was well planned. All these high buildings by the water. I think there was a lack of planning in terms of mass transit in terms of the sewage system. It's all over the news and they have been writing about this for many many years. The government local government got involved with this with developers and I think they overlook the local community to be honest with you. I've been here for like 20 years and I'm not happy about it. I'm not happy about what they did to the neighborhood. I think there are different ways to develop a neighborhood like they did in some areas in Brooklyn for example that they put a cap on the building heights of five six story buildings not the monstrosities are doing in the city so I'm totally against that and it's not fun it's not fun anymore. I also you know I know it's not very popular to say that I think it's great that young families are moving in but they're too much giving to the kids and I don't see enough for seniors in the community and there were people here that lived here for years when this was rough when you had cracks and you had the prostitutes in the corner and they're still here and I feel that the government and the community in general is forgetting about them and it's is all about you know the newcomers. Which is a whole different social economic level. Melissa: Where do you see the neighbor in five to ten years from now? Christian: Overpopulated as it is now. I think it's going to it's going to be transformed. I mean I don't have a magic ball but it's going to be it's already transformed. But a lot of people you can't find parking happened to you today the subway system is not prepared. I mean you go through rush hour wait for the 7 train and courts square where you must let go of like… two trains maybe Because of it. So, I have a problem with the overdevelopment of long and the city. I think it could have done differently with more. planning involved. But I think they all got greedy. Government and developers got very greedy. Melissa: How long have you been here overall? Christian: I settled in New York in 92. And in Long Island City I've been here since 1998. So, that would be twenty years yea. Melissa: Let’s talk more about more about your shows and your art. What is the most memorable show that you’ve had or what is your biggest accomplishment. Christian: Oh, I don’t I don't want to go back. I mean with all the list of shows and you know that's why I have my website. But we didn't put together a quite interesting show now in September of this year at the Plaxo gallery which is a great art space that the artist community have. I don't know for how long but it's really well. And we put together an exhibit about climate change. I don't know if it's an accomplishment or achievement but I'm pretty much in into this climate change problem and that many people deny. So, um yeah, I was very turned on by that because we had good artists participating it was a group exhibit. We had good artists participating and we had good work and very good feedback from the public and the press and climate change organizations. Melissa: And what do you specifically specialize in art? Christian: I do painting and drawing visual arts. [00:15:12] And where do you get your inspiration from? Christian: Usually life for the last year. It's been a change I've been intervening pages of The New York Times. To be honest with you. So, what inspires me is more in politics Not specifically politics about partisanship and all that. But in terms of you know where the world is going in terms of again overpopulation is a big topic for me. Consumerism is a huge topic for me. Climate change those things that I think will affect generations to come. Corruption is another one. Melissa: Is there.. Do you have like a certain spot that you go to go ahead you know perform your art work when you are painting? Christian: No, you know I get I get the newspaper and I sit right here looking through these windows to these trees and I do my work here. Melissa: What is your most. I know you've traveled a lot. So, what is your most memorable travel experience ? Christian: That would not be fair because every single travel experience has been Unique whether it was because of the place or the person that I was with. I would have to refer like the other question to the latest one. I mean it's it's with a friend of mine. We crossed the Andi's on horseback. That was rough. It was long. And it was magnificent. Melissa: Are you involved in equestrian? Christian: I grew up in Argentina I would go to people friend’s countryside and ride horses. Am I a professional horseback rider? Absolutely not. Uhm well you know you manage. Melissa: How many languages do you speak? Christian: Spanish as my main one the only one that I can say I control almost absolutely. Uhhhh English and then Italian and a little bit of French. Melissa: How were you able to speak all those languages? Was it hard learning? Christian: I have to give credit to my mother. She always like into languages and she forced me when I was a kid even though I didn't want to, so I have to be thankful to her. Melissa: Does your family? What was the main language in your household growing up? Christian: It was Spanish. It was all spanish Spanish. I mean my grandparents would speak Italian amongst themselves. My parents understood it, but they didn't teach it to me. But I would listen to it. They would basically speak Italian when they didn't want me to know what was going on Melissa: And there there wasn't any traditions passed from the Italian family I guess you know I guess it will be the typical thing you know Sunday pasta. But I don't I can't think of…. You’re digging into my memory now. My grandfather the painter. I only met my grandparents from my mother's side because from my father's side they were they were dead by the time I was born. Umm And my grandfather was his tradition was to make this of as a kind of stew. Once a year it was a big deal. It's called búseca. And I remember that. Melissa: Are there any food places that you go in Queens today that kind of remind you of? Christian: No but I love I love I love the Court's Square Diner. And that's I always say to the owners to Steve and Nick that if I had a lot of money, I would like rent permanently a booth there, so I can go there and do my work and have coffee and see all the people from the neighborhood. I love Court Square Diner….. And I find it inspiring because you still see there's another one. It used to be a place where you'd see all the people from the neighborhood and we're losing that Because you see a lot of new faces now. And I don't want to seem like an asshole, but they don't seem very friendly. It's it's different a different vibe. It's a different vibe. We would go to the diner and you would always like spend like you know before you order you like 10 minutes talking to your friends or neighbors. And now it's different… it's different. Melissa: What do you think is the cause of that? Why is there so many changes? Christian: Rapid development. It was very abrupt. So, I think there was not enough time to absorb all the new comers. I think another factor is that a lot of the development in Long Island City is still rentals. That's why I was talking about greed before they don’t up apartments for people to buy and settle and invest in the neighborhood. There’ll all rentals. So, you have new people coming in living there for like three four years and then your company transfer you somewhere else and you leave so there's no investment in the in the neighborhood and the community. And I guess that's what I've been trying to say complaining about all this development that you see a lot of people coming and leaving. As if it were some I don't know. Sometimes it seems like you know midtown Manhattan. And that's a big change that long island city suffered in my opinion. Melissa: What you say is very diverse inspires people. Christian: Well Queens it's out their Queens is the most diverse borough in the entire country. You know I'm there. You can google it. I don't know how many languages are spoken in Queens in terms of long island city…. It wasn't very populated like other places in Queens. Now it is whose moving in? I don't know. I don't know. I think yeah, I don't know. I see more young white families and Asian Melissa: And then um…. So again, besides the café. the diner is there any other spots you like to go to? Christian: I just love that diner…. uhm Melissa: How often do you go? Christian: I go like ... we eat there like sometimes two ...three times a week if you don’t want to cook that’s the place to go. Christian: I go to LIC bar because you know you can still smoke on the patio. I'm a smoker. You can go to LIC market which is a magnificent restaurant. The owners are great people in the neighborhood. Mandu Cutty's by Giana. They've been here in the neighborhood for a long time. That's what that's the thing also. My partner and myself were involved with the arts and I think for eight years I've been organizing the LIC Arts Open which is a festival of a whole weekend for artists to open their studios and you have exhibits and all that and organized by Richard Masta and other old-time artists in the area. And so, we were always involved with that. We offer the house as a fundraiser. That's why we have to interview Arusty. Ummm So what I'm trying to say is we've been involved with the community with the artist community in Long Island City for quite some time and that's where you can see the change. With all this development. But places where we hang out. I would say still is the diner or now at Plaxo. I mean Plaxo is a great place not only for exhibits and plays but it's also a place for artists to get together and hang out. That's good. Melissa: I know you mentioned you like to run, play sports. What type of… where do you run around here? Christian: That's a good one. We don't have new parks to run I don't run here. I used to run when I was living in Manhattan. What I do here is yoga. And I have a great instructor in Long Island City. Alicia Bustamante and I do yoga, I got into yoga thanks to her. Melissa: And then umm I am just trying to think… oh and the music I hear…classical music. Does this help you also to with your art work? Christian: Classical music calms me down its my volume (laughs) uhm yea I like Since you got here. You asked me these very good questions and I feel that. Because I feel old by answering honestly, I'm totally honest because I used to you know listen to all you know, and Peter Gabriel and you know Sting and all that. And lately and I am trying to listen to more classical music because there are no lyrics, I don't want to hear them. Yappy yappy yappy yappy. Which is age I believe. Melissa: Does this… does this help you with your painting and your art? [00:25:43] It helps me with… Yeah. Obviously, I mean… I always have music when I when I paint. But even when I don't paint I do I like the music because you can’t listen to the birds here unfortunate because you feel the pumps. I mean with all the construction around you. So, in the past you used to listen to little birdies and the trees and now it’s all like construction work and sirens, so you know that’s also a change in the neighborhood. Melissa: Did you always know you wanted to be an artist… a painter? Christian: I was always since I have memory. I always had like a pencil or a crayon in my hand. I remember my mother you know… getting mad at me because I would like do it on the walls. I didn't study formal art because in those days and at that time I think it was a generational thing. My parents were like well you're going to study art you've got to starve. So, you might as well you know find something more practical to do. And that's when I got into communication and but then. The bug was inside me and I was hanging out with artists at the time and the inspiration of my grandfather that I told you. So I started painting and I started hanging out with people down in Argentina and I continue doing that here. I wouldn't be able to tell if I wanted to be an artist from many years I didn’t know even what the fuck I wanted. So, you know it wasn't about a profession or an activity. But I always knew that there was something different. Ah different because I ended up being gay or I was always gay. I don’t know …I had a bisexual life for many years and it was different in the way I saw things. It was emotionally within my family my parents were divorced for 10 years and then they got back together. So, I don't come from a stable nicely like family although I love my parents and I'm very appreciative from what I got from them. Honestly, I really appreciate everything. No I didn't know that but I knew there was something different. From my perspective that was clear really early on how it was going to take shape I have no clue. Melissa: And did you always.. was art always an outlet for you from everything that was going on? [Christian:] I was a very shy kid and I was very timid. Thanks to therapy again I'm from one side and you know go into psychotherapy is almost like a national sport down there. Not like here but they still have the stigma that psychotherapy. There's something wrong with you or you're nuts or something. Uhhhh Buenos Aires has a very people who are into that they know that they have a very specific school of psychotherapy. So uhm Because of that I think I got more outgoing social, but I was very timid and very shy I still am. It's just that I forced myself you know to break out of that shell Melissa: Were you shy coming to New York when you first were here? Was it overwhelming? Christian: uhhhhh. It's a good question because nobody forced me to come so I came here because I had a very good life down there. I didn't come here because I was looking for a particular, I had a good job. Down there. I had. Nobody understood because I really had a really good life. I think I left the country because of my sexual orientation to be honest with you. Ummm I was there with my girlfriend and blah blah blah. And I needed to find out more about me and I thought that it was moving from one neighborhood to the other wasn't enough. And I always wanted to experiment and challenge myself in a different culture in a different country. So, for all those reasons I left Argentina. Uhh but I have to be clear on that because I did not come here because I wanted to get more money. That was not my story. My story was more like a personal journey. More than coming here and getting a better job and getting a car and the American Dream. That’s not in my spectrum at all. It was never in my spectrum Melissa: How did you know you were ready to make that move? Christian: To leave the country? Melissa: Yea Good Question. Ummm I grew up around … my father was always back and forth. So that sense of like longing and separation and anxiety was always there which is not comfortable. Ummm I knew that I was ready when I realized that again I had a really good job I was making good money. Uhhhh I was not that happy. And my best friends at the time left the country to go study abroad to go and try their luck abroad. And that ignited and that triggered, and I was going to do it for a year. And as a matter of fact, I had a job down there and they said ok go do your thing we will wait for you. And I resigned. I think from Paris a year later. I sent them a fax we had fax in those days there was no internet. And and I never went back formally. Melissa: What job was that in? Christian: Advertising. I was a creative copywriter for advertising for many years. Uh interesting enough not into the visuals. I was doing all the conceptual, campaigns and tv spots and all that as a copywriter. I never mixed the visuals with that. They were both very creative. Honestly. Umm that’s what I was doing and then I did that for a while here and I was doing it in Spanish down there so it was very hard to fit into Madison Avenue which is the cradle of advertising internationally having Spanish as your first language cause there were a lot of double antinode in English I was missing so I realized that it was not going to be for me. And by that time, I was already into the arts. I knew that it was going to be through art and I would have to make a living somewhere and that’s where the indication fell on my lap. uhh and maybe it doesn’t sound very good I really enjoyed it all the years I did it. I was totally into it. And then I realized it was almost like a fantasy that I had before my mother and my father were both into education. I grew up with that and I always wanted to give it a shot. I don’t know, I think I am like going off topic. Melissa: And Uhh what keeps you motivated to stay within the arts ... and I, I know you mentioned earlier umm you were warned it was going to be tough... starving artist but what keeps you motivated and striving to keep going? Christian: It’s a good question. I think we all go through that umm what keeps me going is that’s who I am even though you go through periods where you do not produce well. That point of view I mentioning before is always there, that’s who I am. I think I will like keep doing this until I drop dead. And it has nothing to do with success. I mean if success comes great welcome and if nothing happens, I will still be painting and drawing and doing my creative shit. Uhhh because that’s who I am .. as a matter of fact, when I go through periods for some reason, I didn’t do it, it feels weird, it feels that I am not attending this part of me of who I am. What motivates me I have no idea. I think life itself. And all the things that we have to do and say. And what advice would you give to young artists that want to pursue art as a career? That you need to have a very thick skin uhhh I think it boils down to economics. Same like with acting or anything. Yes, pursue it and do it like the typical cliché follow your dreams all that bullshit but ummm do it but you need to have a very thick skin because it’s a matter of economics and market. Uhhh the market cannot absorb all the artists that want to be artists out there. The market cannot absorb all the wannabe actors. So, there are going to be casualties. And that’s life that’s what I that’s what I was saying I mean I could be a casualty or not. I don’t know. But it doesn’t matter I will still do what I do. Not out of being capricious or stubborn I will do it because that is who I am and what I need to do but in terms of advice I don’t like to give advice. But it would be that it would be like you know you have to toughen up and you have to have a thick skin and you have to get used to rejections and that’s good because it will make you think of what you are doing and maybe people will get rejected so much that they will say ok I’ll do something else. And maybe with others before all that rejection they will like really to self-evaluate their work. And take it to a different direction or turn around. I don’t know Was there ever umm a pivotal moment in your career that you know changed you and and and told you this is where you need to be? Uhhhhh Ummm when I was doing my quote on quote successful advertising work in Argentina, that wasn’t quite satisfying internally but it was satisfying in terms of my wallet and bank account. Uhh I was lucky enough to have people int the arts that supported me early on with my painting. As they saw something there uhh my grandfather also was very supportive of that you know before than he died. Ummm a pivotal moment I think it happened yea when I came to New York I already knew that I was going to be doing that more like full time. Ummm it no I think it happened in the 80s when I was in Buenos Aires and I was in advertising and I was like sick and tired of the fucking client and his mood for the day and all that uhhh. And seeing that there you know were like you know the budgets were like very high to sell coke instead of Pepsi really there is like you need hospitals schools and all this money going into this marketing bullshit to sell a brand ummm and then I started to go to more to museums and looking at art differently and it hit me in the face it was like this is it, this is it, it’s like this is how I want to look at life uhhh through besides the typically terms of light and shadow and texture and academia in the arts. I wanna look at art a life through art because that is enriching to me. Uhhh that’s why I guess I walked away from advertising. Melissa: Are there any quotes or mottos that you live by? I know it can be hard to think of. Christian: I read a lot laughs I hmmmm quotes I have a million… I I love quotes that’s why I am blanking. I love quotes I use them a lot sometimes for my work uhhh, but I have very bad memory I have no idea. I can’t recall any one. But I do read a lot of philosophy. I do like that. I am not into the novels. I was never into that, but I do read poetry. I do read philosophy and I am always underling passages and I am like oh I think this is brilliant. This is great, so I don’t know Christian: Let’s see what we have here. Uuuhhhhh what do we have here duhhhh duhhhhh Christian: It’s just that I don’t know who said this because I have. Christian: I can’t think of who said it but I have this little book here where I write quotes and this one says the question is what to do with the time that is given to us and I go over this everyday and not I am not into religion but this one was from the buddha that says we are burning with greed ignorance and anger and I think it reflects times that we are living in and I could apply that to everything. Our everyday life art politics friends ",
  "Pili_Rosendo_timecode.txt": "Rosendo Pili, a Filipino American immigrant, was born in Manila, Philippines. He has four sisters and four brothers and they were all born in the Philippines. The family moved to Queens, New York when he was four years old; because of political reasons. He talks about growing up in Queens in the 90’s and what sort of activities he was part of as a child. Moreover, he talks about his exploration of the hip hop genre, becoming an MC, and being a member of an all Filipino group band called “ Deep Foundation”. 00:01:02 he was born in Manila, Philippines and spent four years of his life there. 00:01:19 his life began to take shape as a Filipino immigrant when the family moved to Queens in 1989. 00:02:31 lived in a basement at 64th and Broadway of Woodside, Queens for sixteen or seventeen years. 00:03:30 New York in the 90’s was the worst time to live in because the area he grew up in was not a place to raise a child. For instance, He remembers being four or five years old; playing with rocks in the backyard when he noticed two boys jumping his neighbor’s fence and stealing the neighbor’s television set. This particular memory stood out to him because it was the first time something illegal happened in front of him. 00:05:53 his parents were really protective of him and his siblings because Woodside, Queens was very different from what they were used to back home. Therefore, the kids were not allowed to venture outside of their home on their own. 00:06:39 Attended P.s 152 (33-52 62nd Street, Queens, NY 11377). 00:07:45 was part of an all Pilipino Choir. They would go house to house for caroling and they would sing at St. Sebastian (58-02 Roosevelt Avenue Woodside, NY 11377) and Queen of Angel (44-04 Skillman Ave, Sunnyside NY 11104). 00:08:09 Maria Declare was the person who organized all of the events. Unfortunately, she passed away because of cancer, when he was in seventh grade. 00:09:20 His family was the only Asian family in the block. This caused them to have some altercation with their neighbors. 00:12:11 the choir had children from all different age groups. For instance, he joined it when he was five years old. His older sister on the other hand, joined the Choir when she was seventeen years old. 00:12:49 His school had a couple of kids that were Filipinos, but they were over shadowed by the demographic, which were mostly Indian and Dominicans children at that time. 00:13:20 the family attended St. Sabastian Church (58-02 Roosevelt Avenue Woodside, NY 11377). 00:13:27 the choir he was part of was not organized at St. Sebastian. However, they would practice at the church and sing for the mass. 00:13:51 the church had a lot of Filipino members. 00:14:41 Most of the Pilipino stores would be in 69th and 5th. 00:15:11 the family would go to Crystals once in a while and go to Phil-Am because there were certain things that you could only find at that particular grocery store. 00:16:31 a lot of the things they would do as a family would be at the church because he came from a big family. 00:17:18 they would rent movies sometimes, on Sunday from Jafelly’s video store in Roosevelt. 00:19:48 the family would go to the 65th street Park, which was right across from the house they lived in. 00:22:15 His father used to work as an office admin for the government and was a speech writer as well. However, the family had to move due to political reasons and not feeling safe anymore in the Philippines. 00:23:48 His uncle, got them the visa and they were all able to move to America as a family. 00:24:00 his father had to completely relocate the family to a place where he had very little family, friends, and no job prospect due to his age. There was also a lot of xenophobia directed toward Asians because they were the next immigrant that were coming in in the 90’s and taking space in areas that was predominately black and Latino. 00:25:20 his father worked as a security guard in Alexander’s in Queens BLVD after moving to New York. Alexander similar to Sears. 00:26:29 In the beginning, his mother did not work at all because she had to stay at home to take care of the kids. 00:27:41 the children would get sick all the time because they were not used to or prepared for the cold weather. 00:27:49 they used to get clothes from the Salvation Army or his cousins would give them the clothes they grew out of. 00:28:50 His first memory of Queens was going to school for the first time. He was really scared and cried a lot. 00:30:25 Remembers kindergarten being a confusing time for him. 00:30:31 People would also think that he did not know how to speak English. However, his parents taught him how to speak English even before moving to the United States. Still, he was placed into special Ed class because he colored both side of his paper red when he was supposed to only draw something in red. 00:35:32 as a child, he caught on to things really quickly. Therefore, he was a trouble maker by the time he was in second or third grade. 00:40:42 Attended middle school at P.s 122 (21-21 Ditmars Blvd, Queens, NY 11105). Most of the friends he has made are from junior high school because it was a small program and there were about sixty kids in his grade. 00:41:19 the school was about forty minute train ride from his home. Therefore, it provided him with a level of independence when he started junior high school. 00:42:45 The School provided the students with metro card; it was a white and green card and the students were given three swipes a day so they had to be really carful as to how they used them. 00:48:44 Attended Bronx Science High School. He took a specialized test in junior high school for it and he took that test twice because the proctor messed up. 00:54:51 his experience in Bronx Science was eye opening for him because he got to see how the rest of the city lived. For him, high school was about making friends so he did not take it seriously. 00:59:36 Clinton High School (10 East 15th Street, New York, NY 10003) used to share the same block as Bronx Science. Since they were not in the same league academically; they would always compete against each other in track. 01:02:25 Gangs were a big thing at Harlem and Bronx during that time, so he remembers guys wearing red bandana and green bandanna during 1998 to 2002. 01:03:51 music was a huge part of his life because everyone in his family knew how to sing. Two of his sister knew how to play the piano and guitar and one of his brothers also knew how to play the guitar. 01:05:17 started writing poetry in third or Fourth grade. 01:06:27 He remembers people freestyling in the train and rapping during his junior high school years. However, he still did not make the connection because hip hop is considered a joke to older Filipino. Therefore, he thought of it as a joke as well. 01:08:35 that part of his personality started to expand during high school, because he was exposed to people who supported hip hop. It was during his freshmen year of high school; after writing his first rhyme and reciting it to everyone that he started to see himself as an MC. 01:09:48 he would go to friend Greg Tubales house in Queens to break dance in the basement with Ryan Punsalon, Richard Neylis, and Suitcase (Michael Capito). 01:11:25 MC-ing, for him was like creating an identity in high school. 01:12:16 His earliest influencer was DMX, Ruff Riders. Yonkers was really important to him. He went to school nearby and his girlfriend was from Yonkers, but also Yonkers and the Bronx had a huge and flourishing Hip-Hop scene. 01:13:55 He met one of the other members of Deep Foundation; an all Filipino group band, Poetic when he was fifteen years old; at a mutual friends sweet sixteen party. They were both part of the cotillion and had to practice for it, so they became friends and kept in touch. Many cotillions were held in Astoria, but this one was by Elmhurst. 01:15:33 it was a year or two later, that he and Mark became part of the Deep Foundation group. All the other members were already part of the group. Mainly were guys from New Jersey plus Rosendo and Mark. Members names: verbal teck, words arise, proceeds (CJ), and poetic. 01:18:06 Most of the groups music were lyrical. The internet had a huge presence during that time and people would rap battle each other through instant messenger. Internet rap was a huge thing. People would battle on IM. The best would flourish out of this and actually make it big. 01:22:15 One of the first song concept; the group’s first content based song was called Pain and Loss, which was about September 11th in 2002. 01:24:18 the group’s first album was called “First Draft” and it was released around 2007. 01:26:20 some of the highlights that stands out to him are: making the album, traveling, and touring. 01:33:29 recalls going to the wonder bread Factory with his sister in 37th to get bread and have a party in their home.

  "Plasencia_Merida_timecode.txt": "Merida Plasencia relates changes in her life since the small town where she was born to New York, where she lives now. Many are the vicissitudes which she lived, many are the shocking contrasts of different experiences that she went through. She speaks with clarity but very passionately. We see in detail some of her experiences, the desire to continue contributing even more to that life that she looked to develop turbulently in front of her. Merida knows that she has contributed much with her family and friends, but she would like to continue to be doing more... However, she accepts the limitations that age cause on her, as well as her vision problem, problem against which she fights harshly and tries to follow along without being overcome. 00:00:20 Merida was born in a small town from the Peruvian coast, being the oldest of her parent’s children. Her family had many difficulties, but Merida points out that she had \"excellent parents… within all the needs that we all passed\", since they strove to give them the maximum that they could offer to their children. She says that her father and her mother were never as usual people of the village, who did with their children what their parents did to them, \"my father was not so… I knew everything he spent when he was a child and nothing to do with the way how he treated us because he gave us all the affection that was able and covered all our needs... \"I was one of the girls... I'm talking about when I remember… I was six or seven years old... I was a girl a little spoiled, haughty... than normal for a girl of that age\", but the people who treated her had a different idea of how she was considering herself, of how Mérida was gone. Merida says that \"I don't know if my parents gave me the chance for being the way I was or is it that I wanted to be that way.\" 00: 01:50 Once upon a time arrived the day that Merida and her family had to move to another house. Her father was a fisherman and this work gave him the opportunity to make lots of money in a very short time, and he loved the good things such as jewels. The father knew a family in a nearby town named Chimbote, that family was devoted to jewelry and almost all fishermen went there for buying their jewelry. That family came to love their parents, it was clear that they also did it because they were their customers, it should not be forgotten that the fishermen gave them to earn enough money. The truth is that this family came to have so much fondness with them that they suggested to Merida’s parents to send her to study in Chimbote. 00:03:18 Merida was a girl of about nine or ten years when she went to live to Chimbote, to those friend’s family house. The jewelers were people affluent and, therefore, they had a good house, and received her as if she were part of their own family, \"with its limits, of course.\" Merida was a little girl who had no manners and those jewelers were educated people, \"I tried to accommodate me with the mores of them\" and behaved with her in a \"good\" way that until now, after so many years, Merida still appreciates them and she follows \"remembering all the things I lived when I was in their house.\" 00:04:18 Merida left her home in her village on Monday with destination to Chimbote and returned to her town on Friday afternoon. \"When I arrived back to Samanco (my people) my mother... everyone received me with love.\" By that time her mother possibly had a baby or had much work with her children she already had. Merida says that \"I was a child... I do not know if it was something natural in me, but I protected her so much, I didn't like the people that was around her and so many of them said that I was a brat child.\" Neighbors came to her home, and she told to her mother’s friends that they should go somewhere else to meet with any other ladies of the neighborhood but not with her mother, \"I said to them: no, my mom is not here\", and she did not want his mother to be at those meetings because I had seen those ladies group and they were disliked people, they \"just don't like me\" either, and “I wouldn't let that my mom was... in some way I prevented my mother consort with those people.\" Thus Merida grew up until the complete family moved to Chimbote, which brought a series of changes to the lives of all the family members, but for reasons that I don't remember, the family ended up returning back to Samanco, however later returned to go to Chimbote again, where her younger brothers were studying and they wanted something more than what the home town could give them. \"I was the largest and had to be there for my brothers, for my parents.\" 00:06:28 Merida studied art and sewing in Chimbote. She was a young girl from about fourteen or fifteen years old, and the people admired much to her because \"they said that I was beautiful... I do not know to what extent.\" The issue is that her uncles and all the like thought she did not want to mingle with people surrounding her, but \"I don't think that it was the case because I was a very simple, even shy, very shy girl.\" 00:07:15 Time spent and the family had to move to Lima by her brothers who wanted to study there. In Lima Merida grew up, and \"came the time when I was ready for working, I was like seventeen or eighteen years old...\" She had to work because “my dad did as much as he could, but sometimes that that couldn't be enough because we were many children and all were studying. When I wanted to work, I had no preparation (...) for a good job, for example, of a Secretary, but I had the desire to do so (...) I sought it so persistently that I found a person who helped me, and that was my first job, in a pharmacy, in Lima.\" She learned the work in the pharmacy and she went to another pharmacy after that, another one where she met people who loved her. \"I have had that luck: the people loved me, they came to have me affection.\" So Mérida met someone who knew someone else at a cosmetics company and this person saw in Merida a potential to be representative of that company and thought that she could do that job. That person, a girl, led her to where she past a series of tests and that company finally gave her the job. Sidney Ross was the laboratory’s name that represented the cosmetics company. \"I worked there and it was a nice job… I loved it because all the girls were pretty well and they were always well dressed.\" She felt well there, they gave her everything, and she wore very nice. \"I was lucky that I made me my own clothes myself.\" Merida stayed in that company for a long time, until her friends of the group began to emigrate, to come to the United States. They did all the good-byes and Merida was always in those farewells, and \"for some reason I was encouraged also to come here.\" 00:10:35 Merida said that she had to come, but she had nothing here and she really did not think that someone could help her, but in those times came to Lima a person who lived in New York, and who was a friend of her brother. She and a friend of the family they were together to see and to ask him what possibilities were they and if they could come to his country. That person responded that \"I guess that yes because there is work for everybody.\" It was the year of 1971 and that person told them how they could come and get ahead. Merida came, and \"I was so lucky that I was received for a lovely, a very nice family,\" perhaps, she thinks, she never made to know that family the appreciation which she keeps to them because \"they tended me the hand without any interest in anything: I arrived and they gave me home, food, everything.\" 00: 12:03 When Merida arrived to New York, it occurred (with her surprise) that, at the beginning there is no how to work here, but that one has to be helped by someone to find a job. People who received her here \"gave me everything and without any interest.\" Merida worked in one or another thingy. Those friends, where she lived, presented her to a Peruvian friend and even \"planned my wedding\" because Merida did not know him at all. \"They told me: If you marry with so and so, you will do the wedding here...\" That lady planned her wedding as if she were seeing it, and Merida did not know the person with which the lady were planning the wedding. 00:13:08 Merida was married to the person appointed to be her spouse after four months of having known him. \"I was a pretty girl, he was impressed and offered me marriage… We got married. He had ready all their papers to make the residence.\" Merida got pregnant almost immediately. When she was with one or two months of pregnancy, he had to go to the Peru for the residence, but once there things did not go as he had thought, the American consulate put him a sentence of two years and could not do their roles. When her spouse was in Lima, her child was born here, in New York, and she \"didn't spend it very well because a single woman with a girl\" it was very difficult to move forward, but Merida was a woman, \"I had no qualms about fighting for my girl. I was lucky to have the help of my aunt Olga (sister of my mother)\" who helped her much with her child because she took care of her while Mérida was going to work… That was a very tough stage for her... The family that helped her from the beginning, continued helping her… Then became her cousin Martha, from Lima, who lived with her. Together with her cousin life was better because they shared expenses and so the thing was easier to Merida. 00:15:44 Time passed and Mérida’s spouse did not arrive. Irma, the girl, already had two years when the spouse might just come. Soon get him Mérida was again pregnant of her son Robert. The child was born, but it was somewhat more difficult for Merida because the spouse arrived from Peru with sexist ideas and she had to be very strong in order to keep their marriage. Mérida continued to work. She was a very enterprising person, \"I liked to do things well and where I was going to work, that people liked so much of me, they appreciated me so much that they gave me opportunities...\" She got to work with people of Haute Couture in Fashion Ave. \"and I always had the confidence and appreciation of those people.\" 00:17:34 Merida worked some years, but she had a big problem with her vision and that prevented her from continue to work, so she decided to leave it. But she needed a job, however she did not know what to do. In those times, recently, they had bought the house in which they now live, and her spouse needed all the help, and that required that she works. That was a very hard stage. She stopped working because the company moved and all employees lost work. Run out of work was something very terrible for Mérida. Of course she did not told her spouse, but \"I went out every day, well dressed, as if I was going to work\", but in reality she was going to look for a job. She toured different companies who saw her true potential, but her English was not good, she could not hold a conversation. 00:19:02 Merida had been very lucky in her previous jobs because there were many Latin people and the bosses made all the possible for understanding workers. Later, when she had to change jobs, the thing was not easy because she wanted a good job, a better job, but she could not have it because of the language problem. She could not work in a shop or go to an interview for that same reason. Merida was desperately looking for job until one day she meets a friend who advised her to go to a company of trucks carrying children to school (school buses). Thanks to her friend she got work in that company. It was a job a bit bad because the majority of the drivers treated to the ladies as if they were anything (abused them). \"And I, since I came to this job, my sights were something else... I didn't want to stay there.\" 00:21:01 Mérida began to go to school for studying English in the times in which she worked on school buses, and also began to study the GED, which successfully completed in a short time. She quite improved their language skills. 00:21:36 When Mérida was working three months on the school bus, seeing how women were treated, she did not want to be treated that way, but she couldn't do anything else because the need of working was so great and she had to work there... In that work she had much free time because she only worked a few hours. And one day decided to take the risk and asked a girl, from the school where the bus to leave children, \"do you think if I can do volunteer working here? The girl looked at me in a well-derogatory way, because I was wearing the uniform of the bus and told me: I don't know, but I do not think that they accept you” Merida was so but so discouraged and depressed… Mérida did not know what happened at that moment, but she lifted her mood and said herself that she was going to try anyway. A couple of weeks spent and she asked to another girl the same thing to the previous one, and that girl was so good that she said that she did not know but she advised her to go to speak with the supervisor. Merida went immediately to speak with the supervisor. She acknowledges that her English was bad enough, but \"this supervisor… I don't know what she saw in me... She saw in me the desire that I had, is what I think, and she said to me: well, but you know that this is a work in which... you could get a job where you could make money, here you will not earn money. I replied: I don't care, I like children, I want to work with children, I want to help children, and I can work for free because I have long time, I have always worked full time and now I don't know what to do with my time. And she replied: Ok, well, we will\", and she took her to a classroom and told one lady that was very nice, she would help there. The lady was very nice, very simple and taught the class, showed children that Merida had to take care and gave all the orders. 00:24:22 Merida stayed as a volunteer at that school for a month and when holidays approached the teacher asks her if she wanted to work there, and Mérida responded that yes, that she wanted to work there. Then the teacher told her that that was the very moment. She took her where the supervisor was and told her: \"Merida wants to work here\", the supervisor looked at her and said: \"oh yes? OK.\" She gave her the application and Merida filled it, she needed only letters from people who knew her and certificate of High School (which she already had it). At the end, she took everything and the supervisor gave her the job immediately because the teacher had advocated for her, the teacher had said: \"this is a lady who gives everything and deserves this job\", and Mérida knew it because the supervisor said it to her. 00:25:30 Merida exclaims when she arrives at this point: \"what an incredible! That work was something that I had never thought that I could have because I never had experience of working with children! That was something that God put in my way.\" She was working there little more than 13 years, until she retired. 00:25:48 At this point, Merida said that she has not spoken of her children because she was excited talking about his own accomplishments, which make her feels very proud... She had two cute boys: Irma, his eldest daughter and Robert. Irma has now two daughters and she is teacher... For Merida it was not easy to raise them and give them education because her spouse had a strong character and also the girl, but she says that she was always in the middle, \"trying to help them, always giving them as much as I could, and I always wanted my boys to do what I could not do when I was young.\" 00:26:40 Merida said that Irma grew up, and after finishing her High School, she joined FIT because she wanted to be Interior Designer. She was actually on partial time at FIT, but two years later she already had the opportunity of making full time… In the second year of being studying Interior Design, Irma decided that she didn't want to do that for her life and said to her mother: \"Mommy, I don't want to do that, I've changed idea and I think that that is not for me.\" Merida and Alfonso (her spouse) were surprised because they had already spent enough money to pay school and expensive design books. Merida told Irma: \"daughter, no matter\", she understood her. Alfonso was upset… Irma registered at Queens College where she studied for teacher. She did it very well and finished his Bachelor's degree. Irma was a very enterprising girl, from young girl she always worked in some big places and while she decided to do her master's degree and she graduated with honors. \"This time my daughter gave us a tremendous pride (...) she paid us all the sacrifice that we had made.\" 00:29:25 Robert went to Orlando to study at the University. He is three years younger than Irma. His trip to Orlando was the cause of \"a very large pain for me... maybe for my spouse too.\" Merida said that Robert was young and that he had many setbacks, because he was away from the house and that was the cause of that he committed many errors... one of the mistakes that nearly ends his studies was that he told his mother that in a given year he would not study because he had many debts and wanted to pay them. Merida said that \"I don't know where came from me the power to say to my son: you do not ever say that, I don't want to hear it again, you tell me if you need help, but please I don't want to hear you're not going to study...\" He was frightened. “He said: Mommy, but do not do so, is only for one year, I'm going to return to school. I told him: no, I don't want to hear that... Unfortunately he had already lost that cycle.\" When Robert said all of that, says Merida, \"how could I have the energy that I gave him? How it is that he listened to me? And he wrote a letter… I don't know what he did, I don't know how he regained the scholarship... regained the scholarship which had already being removed from him and then he graduated in finance (...) which I am so, so proud... because that was the greatest thing that I could receive: that my kids succeed in something.” 00:32:00 Merida recognizes that her spouse \"helped me a lot, but he has a very different character\", but she can however say that everything in what their children succeeded, they did so because he worked hard, but she knows that in those achievements \"much had to see my strength, my fortress.\" Irma is now married, she has two young girls \"to whom I love\" and she get a son-in-law that \"I love as if it were my son.\" And \"well, my son is working, he is making things... maybe soon he may also have a home, a spouse... thing that I would like to see.\" 00:33:16 Merida says emphatically: \"I am happy because I am doing great things and I think that they are appreciated (...) I don't want to mention what, because here is the person to whom am I pushing a little bit, but also giving much encouragement to go ahead which is my brother Walter... I hope that he can achieve everything I want for him someday.\" 00:34:25 When Merida arrived to this country that was for her a big change: \"In Peru I was a girl who had everything, I had it all... My mother was a great mother: I came at home from work and my mother had me all ready, so her daughter eat, so her daughter can make the nap (...) to me… I was treated like a queen at work also because... my job was a job where I had to be there very nice... the people admired the girls that were working on that company (...), people went to watch us... At that time I worked at the SEARS store in Jirón de la Unión... and people would look at us: seeing how we were makeup, shape how we dressed, i.e. we were the attraction.\" Mérida does not know now if coming was the best decision for her, then she thinks and says: \"I think yes, it was a good decision because... After all here... It was a very terrible change, because I came... being a girl always flattered, always respected, I came here and what I had to do? I got to a factory, for working with people well rude... because unfortunately there are people who come from our countries and they have nothing, they have no education, have no principles... It was something horrible that I had... I couldn't stop talking about... If I didn't speak they told me that why I do not talk and said horrible things that I won't repeat... My appearance changed in a horrific manner that if someone came from Peru and they saw me, they could say: this is Merida? This is not her, she cannot be... I spent many things... at first it was very hard, very hard working (…) I was who put me in there, and as I was... at that time I was alone because my spouse was in the Peru, I had to work there, I didn't have another choice.\" 00:37:19 Merida says that helping her children at school was very hard for her: \"first by language: I had no English, but it was so lucky that teachers... they knew that I did not speak English, but took me appreciation and they were doing everything for helping me... When Irma was small, I wanted that she was in a bilingual class because the girl didn't know the language... we spoke pure Spanish at home, the girl did not know English. When I decided to put her into the school, I was lucky to find a very nice Colombian Lady, who had been Irma’s teacher in nursery, and she said: no Mrs. Plasencia, do not put her in bilingual class... bilingual classroom teachers do not speak well the Spanish and also they do not speak very well English, the child will not learn Spanish and she also will not learn English. Let her go to a regular classroom... I thank so much to lady Montoya, because she was the one that gave me that advice... Irma was in regular class and in the middle year she was already speaking English well... With Robert there was no problem because he was talking to her sister and learned fast.\" Merida adds that she also learned a little English, but she could not have a conversation with the teachers, who were fond of what she was doing and they made all the possible for helping her. She says: \"I remember that I once went to a class that teachers gave for helping the children in the house... I had learned different math and here... I did not know… they explained it in English.\" So Merida says that she was not capable of helping her children, although she had the desire to help them. When Irma grew up she needed help in math and Merida sought him a College person, a girl that could help her at home because she could not do so since she did not know the language. And the same thing happened with the other courses. That was a \"terrible experience\" for her, but she came out in front so that her children appreciate everything she did for them because she cared and really had the desire to help: that was what made the children appreciate and strive what she did for them. 00:40:55 Climatic difference between Lima and New York was also terrible for Merida. She arrived in October and there was a radiant sun in the street, so she was coming out only with a blouse, blouse that she was wearing inside the house, but the boys warned that she cannot come out because it was cold outside. She answered that if sun was shining it could not be cold outside, so Merida went out without the right clothes and that is something that she always remembers. 00:41:49 Merida had never suffered from allergies in her country, but after her son Robert was birth she had a very severe change in her system and she began to have a terrible allergy to pollen. She had to go to the doctor that put her a shot, which did not like her, but that was the only way that she could feel good. 00:42:37 Merida’s mother came to this country because her sister, Carmen Rosa, came in... Initially Merida did not want her sister Carmen Rosa came... Once, when Mérida was in Peru, her sister told her that she wanted to come, Merida asked her not to do it because it was very hard, Carmen was good in Lima, she had her work, for what reason did she want to come? Merida talked about the experience that she had herself throughout the process that followed her transfer from Lima to New York. She also left a job in Peru, she resigned and \"I didn't spend bad things because I had... that family that helped me so much, but I didn't want that she came to start with a work that had nothing to do with what she was doing in the Peru. But my sister said to me: no, I'm going to go. And Carmen came in against the odds, and we could help her, received her... She came by Mexico, across the border, through terrible things. Poor girl... but she managed to get to New York and we received her, and we gave her everything she needed to (...) until Carmen was able to find a job (…) and then she wanted to bring her children.\" When Carmen Rosa brought her children, “my mom and my dad also came with the children, who were like their own children...” At that time Mérida became citizen and asked their parents as residents, and then they brought all his other children because they also became citizens, that is why the whole family is already here. 00:45:13 Merida says that she has not had many friends because she has always had care of persons with which she wanted to have a close relationship. She had good friends and also others that she thought they were good but they weren't: \"I've had people good, very noble that I appreciate so far\" and they do still remain friends. But \"I have not always had very close friends, always there has been a limit\", and perhaps for this reason she has obtained what she has achieved. She thinks that friendships can exert a positive or negative influence on what one wants to achieve. Mérida has been someone who has proposed something and she has succeeded, that is the reason by what she is always saying that \"if you wish it, you are able of doing it.\" 00:47:38 Merida says that \"my father always told me: It has to be you who gives the example to your brothers. If you're good, your brothers will go out good. And it seems that it is true (...) because they are all great people (...) My father is no longer with us, but my mother always have thought that I, her eldest daughter, have the last word. She tells me: daughter what you say, that's going to be.\" But Merida knows that everyone has their own criteria and everyone makes their own decisions. 00:48:53 Merida considers that her family is very nice, although not very united, since in each family there is always something, even though they try to keep always united despite the discords that always exist in all family. 00:49:42 Merida says that \"I see me as a fighter woman (...), an entrepreneur who has tried and has accomplished things (...), first at all with my children, with my spouse (because he was very different when I met him)\" She considers that she has achieved things that others could not. She came, as most, with nothing, and managed the appreciation and affection of many people... \"I knew a lady who was my boss, and she hugged me, cried with me, said to me her story. I said: from where? What I have (...) how people see me? (…) I know that they were seeing me as something simple, sincere... It must be that that made that that people had me that love.\" In the school where she worked with children, bosses did not give anyone two or three days off, but to her they did, because at that time she went to Virginia to see her dad who was very ill, \"they gave me days off because I've always been punctual.\" 00:51:56 Merida said that it was a very difficult time for her when Robert wanted to drop out of School. That was a very hard day for her. It was also very difficult to leave her job. The day that she withdrew, when she retired from job, it was very tough because she knew that he could give more, but problems with her vision made her to leave School. \"I'm 74 years old and until now I think I can give much yet... That's what I think, but I don't know if I can, because the body ages but the mind is young.\" 00:53:14 Merida speaks a little of his brother, who is doing the interview, when they lived in Peru. 00:56:25 Merida says that, when she was young, she was buying for her siblings clothes, trying always to that they were presentable, that was what she did until she came in here, she was always helping in one way or another, and \"that is from what I'm proud and my boys are also.\" 00:57:02 Merida says that here, in East Elmhurst, she has lovely neighbors, \"I don't know if someday I can pay them all the favors which these people have made us.\" Four families are those that she has more gratitude because they have done amazing things, they are always united: those neighbors take them to the doctor when they need it, no matter where it is, and they are always in constant communication. When one of them travels out, the others are pending to help them. The district has not changed for them, while ever comes different people, but the three families that are the closest neighbors, are kept here. Merida lives here more than 30 years, as well as her neighbors. She also acknowledges that they \"have helped us incredibly\", and all of them \"take care of the neighborhood, we are always outstanding of anything that happens\" and are always united. 00:58:42 Merida says that she has now an Ecuadorian doctor who is very good, but she always prefers a physician that is alien and not one Hispanic. She says that she has had bad experiences with Hispanics at a young age, since when her children were small and the pediatrician was a doctor who almost did not speak… if one asked him something, he answered with a yes, a no or he said nothing. \"I said to myself: and what is this...? I said to him: the child has fever, and reluctantly he was wondering since when, what medications you are taking, and there was... Doctor can give you such a thing? The doctor responded Ok. That was all.\" Merida had another bad experience with a doctor who was not Hispanic, but was used to treat many Hispanic people and \"it seems that because of that, he thought that all Hispanics were the same, he does not mind to answer\" or staying without saying anything because \"Hispanics, unfortunately, are people who do not speak English, do not questions, they do not delve more into their state of health and doctors believe that they can do whatever they want with them.\" Once Merida went to a neurologist with her spouse Alfonso and she began to say that his family had a story of Parkinson, and the doctor responded dismissively with an \"Ok doctor.\" She was amazed: \"Doctor you don't want to know my spouse’s medical record?\" \"And then he changed a little bit and said: Ok, already, yes of course, but he had answered badly before, as if he didn't need the information that I was given.\" 01:00:59 Merida speaks now of the lawyers. She says that here there are many poor people, when they have a problem they will see the lawyer and the lawyer treats like trash all those people: \"I've been through that, but no more! (…) I never seek lawyers who are Latino because they have done incredible things to me: once we had to do a refinancing and we had not even need lawyers, but Alfonso, by language, he wanted someone who was with us, who represent us. The lawyer, what did he do? Nothing, he wanted to obtain loans (...) in which he had a commission or something. When I told him: no, we are not going for any loan, he said to me: why? Lady, you have to take advantage, they are giving you a loan (...) you can do what you want with that money... I said: doctor, we do not need that money. He said: then I won't be able to do the work. So I said: Ok then we will not do that... My spouse was annoying because he wanted to take the money (...) I said: no, we do not need that money. What will happen with that? We are going to borrow more and how many years will we have to be paying the House...? I called the Bank (...) directly and tell it: we want to do a rollover, but I need to know what I have to do. The bank already knew it because the lawyer had already applied to that same bank... it told me: yes, but you have to make the loan, and I told it: Ok, then I will not make any loan or any refinancing. It said: but wait one moment madam, there is a way in which you can do it... It was that we did not had to make any loan or had to pay six or seven thousand dollars for closing (…) I paid, I do not know if one or two percent of what we had and that was what I did. And when we went to do the procedure, lawyer arose because he wanted that we do the check what was supposed that he had won by a very few roles… The lawyer was not that day, but was his father representing him, and he made to sign us a few papers... The lawyer wanted us to give $500 to his father, and I told him: you know what? I do not have any contract with your dad. We have one with you, but not with your dad... and he claimed US $1200, and I did a check for $1200 but I did not another one for $500. Do you know what the lawyer did? He broke the check there, in front of us and in front of everyone who was there.\" Her spouse and her son were present there. \"I said to Alfonso: you don't pay anything, not send him any check...\" Alfonso sent him a check for $900. After what the lawyer had done, we don't have to have done anything. He could go to anywhere. If he had broken the check, and that would have been the evidence... Since that time Latino lawyers do not give me confidence... \" 01:05:31 Merida says Hispanics try to take advantage of the Hispanic people. When she calls somewhere and it is asked which language she wants to use, she doesn't choose Spanish, she asks someone to speak English, \"even if my English is not perfect,\" and she prefer it because Hispanic people does not help... \"That happened to me.\" She does not know if she is wrong or not, but there is a tremendous disunity and that should change: \"Hispanics are people who should unite, unite more and help each other.\" 01:06:30 Merida is proud because it has achieved things that people with more education than her have failed and all that because of her effort, by dig, by wanting to do things, \"that's what I always say to people: you can do it, just have to plan big and going to achieve.\" She says that she may be wrong but she believes that that is very important: \"having in your mind what you want to do, and it won't be today or tomorrow, but perhaps you can eventually achieve it.\" 01:07:32 Merida says that she talked about Hispanics in a negative way because of the experience that has she has had, but she acknowledges that there are very good people that has known among them... She knows a family, Saldarriaga, where one of the children is a lawyer, the other has a good job, and they are meeting since she married Alfonso. Saldarriaga family was at her wedding and it is a very good and very humble people and they have accomplished good things with effort, \"they are one of the few friends that we can tell that they are really friends.\" And she can also say the same thing about some people she met when she worked, they are few but she still manages to maintain that friendship \"and people that I estimated.\" That first and foremost, \"you see the sincerity, you see that people appreciate you\" and \"that's important, that is great.\" 01:08:50 Merida is now concerned about a professor that worked as her supervisor: \"my work was appreciated by people because I made my work with dedication. It was not the same way as did many who sought how not to do the work (...) I made a mistake once, I know that I made a mistake... The teacher came out because there was a child to whom I had taken him out of school and I didn't have to do it... The laws had changed at the school and I had not paid attention to that (...) the supervisor came to give me the reach and she spoke to me very badly, yelled at me and all that caused grace to me... I said to myself: this lady, is she speaking that way to me? And I smiled. Of course, she bothered much for that cause and made a change in my status, in which I was working. I was soon to retire, but usually people who was going to remove they did not want to put them on a stable class because it was the year... and then I had to be put back to others. I did not like this change, and I went to tell her why he had made that change with me. She told me: you laughed when I called you care. And I said: yes, actually I laughed... It was as if I was passing through a surreal moment because nobody, nobody, has spoken to me that way, especially at work, never anyone... And she was quiet, she did not tell me anything... because I knew... I knew that I was being sincere. And so it happened that (...) when I greeted her she sometimes answered me back and sometimes not… But one day I saw her in a store (...) and (…) she told me: Mérida, and I said Ok. (…) And that was all that happened just there.” 01:11:53 Merida says that she was lucky for working in sewing and she was a person that had been appreciated, esteemed because “I had a talent (...) and was working with designers, and got to work in Haute Couture, and I came to achieve very good things in that branch. One of the things that I did was dress for models, samples were for the models, and arrived to work with designers of fame (...) all that ended. Anita Pagliaro was a designer for rich people, they sent her to make their costumes and I was one of whom made those dresses, and I made up the pattern and all, and developed their dresses (...) Anyone could not make it (...) Those are good achievements, achievements that I got starting from below, from the factory, but I managed to get out of the factory (...) by my effort, because... seriously, I was well into… and what I wanted to achieve it. Walter, I started working in a factory... when immigration was going… we had to hide. All those things I have gone! And, however, I gradually got things that many people failed to (...) I think that the effort, the desire to do things, is very important.\" 01:14:21 Merida points out that \"I am a person who has accomplished a lot (...), I feel loved by my family, my children, my grandchildren, my brothers, my mother... and perhaps I can still continue, keep making things, but clearly I know it won't be easy because I am older... but yes, yes I'd do things to my family (...) And thank God I have come to live in Queens (because we lived in Brooklyn), and in Queens is where we have achieved all that, in Queens I was lucky to reach a site that my children went to a school that was very good, the 669 PS, I love it so far. My children learned there (...) and after they went to a school that was not very good at that time (and I think it is not good now), but, as they say: love is power. The boys managed to get out... They could have done much more, but sometimes things are not given... But Robert was always in the kind of honor from that school (...) He went to Brooklyn Tech, but he was very young and was disoriented because there it was the very best (...) One day he said: mom, I need a scholarship to study in this school and here I'm not going to have it (...) He knew that he was good, but he also knew that he was not the best... In part, he did well (...) Cost me working him out of Brooklyn Tech (...) because they didn't want to let it go. What an incredible! (…) But he was determined to and they had to get him out (...), he wanted to go to school here, where, at that time, Irma was still studying (...) He did it in a smart way because there he was in kind of honor and there he had the opportunity to take the scholarship because there were many boys who did not finish high school and scholarships were there (...) He got to the Hispanic Group and the Hispanic Group helped him to attain a scholarship to study in Florida.\" The Hispanic Group helps schools boys for getting anything they need. They gave Robert three-quarters of a scholarship and he studied that way, but his parents always had to collaborate with their education in different ways. 01:19:40 Merida is happy because she achieved many things, above all for her boys, her family, \"which for me they are all here, virtually... could it be more joy? (...)\" There are still things I want to achieve, for example in you, I desire that you can achieve what you want, what you expect, what you need...\" Those \"are achievements that I'm living, that I am feeling, and I know them because my family let me know\", they are Beto, Carmen, Pablito, you... What more could I ask for? 01:21:23 Merida points out that \"life is full of pleasant and unpleasant things, but we have to know them (...) You have to see the beginning of things (...) I perhaps would not have to do so, but I have had help... people who liked me, people who fought for helping me... For I wanted to come to school, there was a lady that helped me to get into that. She told me: Mérida, what do you want to do? And I said: well, I want to work with children, that is what I want to, and she told me: but have you worked on something like it once? I responded to her that I have not.\" Then, she added that \"everywhere where it can be they ask for experience. But that's what I got in my head, and that was: children... When I worked with this great lady, Susan Gille, an excellent person... with her it was that I started to realize my problems with the eyes, because I worked with her on a very delicate thing. And she told me: Mérida, you are not going to be able to work on this for a long time (...) that's the reason why I began to see the reality and I started to seek new horizons.\" 01:23:13 Somehow, Merida could tell that her way of being is more American than Peruvian, because she has learned a lot, and she knows that Peruvians, perhaps Latin Americans, do not express what they think, what they feel. \"I am who I am, I like to say what I feel... I do not always have words for that (...), but somehow I let it know... The change that has occurred in me about how I was in Peru long time ago... I was a very shy child (…) my friends saw something in me since I was a child.\" Merida recalls her friends Luz and Alejandro... He was an engineer, and she was a girl who worked with her in her first work in Lima. \"I was not at the height of them, to be honest, but they saw in me something... I was treated as a sister. I was the godmother of her first child, and he wanted a spouse for me to their level, unfortunately I was a little girl and I was not thinking about that... They always tried to help me... They saw me as if I was a sister (…) I was not a person that was higher than them and, however, they saw me... maybe that desire, perhaps this kindness, perhaps that simplicity... can be.\" 01:25:48 Merida says that in her house \"I was the Princess (...) everyone was around me... revolved around me. Everyone admired me, and I sometimes had to fear that the girls could not achieve... by imitating, by watching... they looked at me. (...) My dad always told me (...) He was like my friend (...), he never criticized me or said: you can't do this, you can't do that (…) I was a simple girl, without malice, I had no malice in my head and saw things through different eyes (...) I spent tremendous ingenuity by things, because... With Luz and Nelly… we went to La Molina University because we had friends that... to the feast of La Molina because we had friends engineers and we were going to (…) and then we did not know who could bring to us and we had to come anyway, trying to of... It was dangerous at that time, because all that was dark, La Molina (where the University were placed) was dark.\" 01:28:30 Merida says that \"when I came I, you know, that was huge because it was well painful for me and I know that for all of you too.\" 01:28:47 Merida states that \"when Irma was a little child, Irma could wear the dress that I gave her, at times she said: no, I don't like, or something... and as we didn't have much, we could not give her many choices (as it is said now), she used what I gave her. Also Robert... They grew up in a humble house because we didn't have the means to give them what they perhaps wanted to. But, yes, I always thought that my daughter is going to be this, I mean, my daughter will be able to go walking, my daughter will be able to enjoy, enjoy... that was what I wanted for her... And of course, it's different now, everything is different, because Irma for example... they can… they are professional… they can give the daughters what they could not have, something that I don't like much sometimes because it is a little far-fetched, because they... for example, giving choices to the boys... Comes David in the morning with three dresses for Victoria: Victoria what do you like? Victoria says: not, not, nor... And that does not... What I did before with Irma? What was that I said? This is the garment you're going to get and that was the cloth that she worn... Sometimes my daughter came out crying from the house because... as she was small and she was something capricious... And I told her: no honey, we have to go fast, now, now, now... and she came out crying. I left her crying at school and then I had to call the teacher for asking her how it was my daughter and she answered me that well... and the soul came back to my body again, and I already felt fine... But that was my life: running. But that was not only my life, it was the life of many people, especially working people, requiring wages in order to survive (…) Many people happened worse things than I've lived… I've had enough luck Walter, because, first of all, I had my aunt, who helped me with Irma, then I had people to whom I loved to very much and that helped me, for example, once I knew... met a Cuban lady who came to my house to stay with Robert while I went to school to pick up Irma. Robert was sick and she came and stayed with Robert, and she did it with love, not for money... She did it by helping me, as friendship... And yes, I have had people that have helped me a lot (...) and then I've also helped them, I have also given to people, I have given... what do you say…? Maybe I've not been able to help much because sometimes there was no how... but I've done some things that I am proud to have been able to make them.\" ",
  "Podd_Valentina_timecode.txt": "This is a Queens Memory Program interview with Rich Taylor. In the span of twelve years Valentina has lived in various neighborhoods in Queens including Elmhurst and Richmond Hill. ",
  "Post_Richard_timecode.txt": "Richard Post is a World�s Fair historian and an ardent advocate for Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. He first visited the 1964-65 World�s Fair at age 10, which he describes as the �perfect age� to be inspired by its grandeur and optimism about the future. When he returned to the park as an adult in the 1970s and �80s, he was shocked and dismayed to see remnants of the fair lying in ruins. Richard has worked tirelessly to preserve and rehabilitate both the surviving elements of the fair and the park itself, and believes things are finally headed in the right direction. 00:00:20 Richard visited the fair when he was 10 and 11 years old. He remembers the positive techno future it represented and felt he was the perfect age to really appreciate the fair. He has spoken to others who were the same age for the 1939-40 World�s Fair who had a similar reaction. Those who were 16-18 were more interested in dating and getting into trouble at the fair. 00:02:23 He was in the 4th or 5th grade living in East New York around the Brooklyn/Queens border in 1964, then moved to Williston Park in Nassau County in 1965. So he was experiencing a lot of new, exciting things, including the fair. 00:03:20 Richard remembers driving with his father and grandfather, seeing the fair being built along the Long Island Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway. It was exciting watching it all being built � towers, dinosaurs, rockets, etc. � and then seeing the finished product. He remembers, though, hearing his father bad-mouthing Robert Moses and all the congestion the construction caused. The contrast between how a child viewed the fair versus an adult was striking. 00:06:07 He remembers visiting the fair maybe three times, but it�s hard for him to remember exactly because he visited the fairgrounds several times after the fair had been taken down. Richard had convinced himself and his peers that he had jumped the turnstile and got into the fair for free but explains why he believes that this could not have been true. Finding ways to sneak into the fair was really popular, and there are many online communities that share such stories still today. 00:08:20 In Richard�s visits � one with his parents, one with a school group, and one with his grandfather � he remembers seeing everything on �the checklist� and covering a lot of the fairgrounds. He interviewed his mother once to see if she could help clear the line between memories he had when he was a child and memories he got from films, stories, etc. of the fair but she wasn�t a lot of help. His father had an old-fashioned J66 Polaroid camera that he used to take numerous photos, but he did not take any photos when they were at the fair because the camera was large and required a lot of materials and work to take successful photos. 00:11:17 He stresses that the NY World�s Fair had a huge influence on himself and his entire generation. Many people decided to take on a career related to a field, art, technology, etc., which they were first exposed to at the fair. Richard always wanted to be a photographer and began doing work for a shoe company (which is no longer in business) that tried to recreate that �corporate exhibit pizzazz� from the fair. Without even realizing it, he found that he moved on to do audio/visual work for most of the key players who provided multimedia for the World�s Fair. 00:14:50 The fair�s influence on Queens was incredible because of all the different cultures it brought to the area. Richard explains that the title �World�s Fair� was an arrogant American title and that it was actually just an International Exposition. Calling it a �world�s fair� is deceptive because most of the attendance was American. Many of the people from other countries who staffed the fair pavilions remained in Queens. He does not think that there will be another World�s Fair in New York City but he really does believe that we are now living in a �world�s fair.� [Queens Borough President] Melinda Katz has given Queens the title of �The World�s Borough� and Flushing Meadows Park, �The World�s Park,� which is the legacy of the fair. 00:19:34 Richard, not yet 18, had moved to Jackson Heights from Long Island when he first revisited the park. In the early 1980s, historians, including David Oats, worked with the Queens Council on the Arts (which was created by Melinda Katz�s mother) to create exhibits on the World Fair. The Queens Museum also had relics of the fair, which rekindled his interest in the fair. Queens Museum was selling the maps and guidebooks from the fair, which Richard was able to buy for almost nothing, and he would use them when walking through the park. In the �70s and �80s, when he visited, there were still deserted remains of the fair. Revisiting the rundown, deteriorating space exhibit seemed the most heartbreaking to him; pieces of the rockets and space vehicles were left to ruin. 00:25:15 Richard talks about the mystery that still puzzles many people: What happened to the fair? Why was it left to become a �graveyard�? When he began using the Internet, he found that there were a lot of communities still excited about the fair; he was shocked, too, to find a lot of misinformation and xenophobia about the park. But, he feels that the park now belongs to all of the ethnicities who live in the area. He marched with a large number of undocumented Americans in order to save the park from being destroyed, and as a result it�s been given back to the locals. He believes we are back to a place where we are working towards �living the dream� of the fair again. He is really at home with being an advocate for the park. 00:31:06 He explains that everyone talks about Robert Moses and the fair, but no one talks about David Oats. He was a personal friend of Robert Moses and would be 65-66 years old now (he died at 58). Oats lived in the Flushing Projects when construction began for the fair and frequently snuck inside. One day he was caught and brought to Robert Moses, and they became great friends. Oats became a civil planner, a journalist, and an advocate for Queens and Flushing Meadows. There is a small patch of land � �David�s Garden� � dedicated to Oats in the shadow of the New York State Pavilion; Richard regrets that his role has not been more widely celebrated. ",

  "Radu_Dimitru_timecode.txt": "Dumitru Radu has lived in Woodside since coming to the United States with his wife and son in the mid-1950s. Born in Romania, Radu spent most of his career as a commercial airline pilot. After living here more than 50 years, he maintains his enthusiasm for the freedom he has found in this country. 00:00:57 Dumitru Radu reflects on the political climate of Europe after World War II, especially the influence of the Soviet Union on Eastern Europe. In addition to having physical control, the Russians sought to control education to make people �real Communists.� 00:03:10 Soviets wanted to make certain that the better educated classes were in line with political system, not just in Radu�s native Romania but all over Eastern Europe. 00:05:00 The climate of Soviet persecution led Radu, along with his wife and son, to join the waves of refugees seeking to leave Eastern Europe. After leaving Romania, they first lived in France, and then received a visa to enter Colombia, where they lived for five years. Radu found employment in Colombia as a pilot for Avianca airlines; his wife taught Romanian. 00:05:48 In 1955, Radu and his wife decided to vacation in New York for one month. His wife was so taken with the freedom she witnessed that she insisted they relocate here permanently. The immigration office said his wife could get a visa to stay here if she could find a teaching job. Since she was not certified to teach in U.S. public schools, they contacted the Episcopalian Bishop [James] Pike to see if she could be hired in an Episcopalian private school, and he found her a position. She then received a visa, and Dumitru and their son were allowed to emigrate here as well. 00:09:33 On settling in the U.S., Dumitru�s wife taught at the school of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. He worked as an airline pilot but could not get a job in the U.S. He received an offer from Air Liban, a subsidiary of Air France based in Lebanon. 00:11:06 He notes that in Romania, all educated people learned to speak French. He also learned Spanish during his time in Colombia; his Romanian accent sounded very similar to a Spanish accent to his friends in Colombia. 00:12:25 Radu accepted a position with Air Liban and relocated to Lebanon; his wife finished out the school year in New York and then joined him there, though they were both considered American residents at that point. His wife got a teaching position in the American school of Beirut, but they returned to live in the U.S. for a period of time each year to maintain their American residency. There were many American businesspeople in Beirut at that time. 00:15:40 Around 1958, the Radu's purchased their house on 57th Street in Woodside, Queens, although they were still living primarily in Beirut. He says it is important to Romanians to own the house in which they live. 00:16:39 When the Radu's first bought their house, the neighborhood was primarily German and Italian. Now, he says it is probably about 50 percent immigrants from South America. He has a chance to use his Spanish again when shopping in the neighborhood. 00:19:13 He went to Queens College for adult education classes in order to increase his understanding of American culture. At age 60, he was forced to retire from his pilot�s job according to aviation age limitations. Since he was not yet eligible for Social Security, he worked for five years as a translator with the New York State Department of Labor, helping to translate between parties in labor disputes. Many immigrants, he noticed, did not learn English despite living in the U.S. for many years. 00:25:18 Radu loved his career as a pilot, describing it as �the most beautiful occupation.� He enjoyed traveling around the world and being paid to do it. 00:26:41 The Romanian community in Queens: He feels he�s �not an authority� on that, mostly a private person and not really involved in political organizations. He has friends of many different ethnicities. 00:29:31 He wrote a book (in Romanian) and is giving a copy to the Queens Memory Project. It has photos of Radu and his wife on pp. 56-57. 00:30:25 Radu was a pilot in Romania during World War II. He gives a brief history of Romania and its location near the Black Sea and Carpathian Mountains; many invading forces passed through the region over the centuries. He stresses the �Latinity� of Romania and its language, as distinct from its Slavic neighbors. Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion. 00:36:13 He was a civilian pilot in Romania, but since all pilots worked for the state, they were automatically militarized during WWII. His duties included flying fuel to battlefield locations and transporting wounded soldiers. During one such flight he was shot down by a Russian fighter plane; he feels it was a miracle that he survived since there were 114 bullet holes in his plane! 00:40:43 In the photo with his wife, they are in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The photo (in the book) from 1988 was taken in Cleveland, Ohio. He refers to the famous Romanian poet Eminescu and composer Enescu. The suffix �escu� indicates a family name. 00:43:03 Radu remembers the film �The Golden Door� [1941, also known as �Hold Back the Dawn�] starring Charles Boyer as a Romanian seeking to immigrate to the United States. 00:44:22 After living in the U.S. for many years, Radu remains convinced that the American concept of freedom is the �perfect organization of a civilized society.� He returns to the subject of �The Golden Door,� noting that the name of Boyer�s character ended in �-escu.� Romanians have the option of adding �escu to their family names or keeping them shorter, as Radu has. 00:50:15 Radu currently has tenants in his house in Woodside; there are six apartments in the half of the building he owns. The other half of the building is owned by a Filipino man, with whom he gets along. He has found when he rents to Romanian tenants they expect special treatment because of their shared heritage. 00:53:17 Radu recommends a book by another Romanian immigrant that deals humorously with differences between the Romanian and American way of doing things: �The Pleasure Is Mine,� by Mircea Vasiliu.

She recalls a normal childhood, although her parents, especially father was politically active; grew up with lots of relatives, cousins and neighbors in a “tight knit community within a large city.” 00:02:19 A scholarship brought her to Grinnell University, Iowa, which was “the opposite end of the globe” in every way; first semester was tough - “speaking English everyday”, since English was not first language; plus individualistic culture and food, everything was a “big shock to my system.” Finding food she could eat was hard since she was a vegetarian and “Food didn't taste like food.” So all she ate was “salad for lunch and dinner.” First semester was hard but being in the “middle of nowhere” created strong friendships; in touch with friends and faculty to this day. 00:05:33 Came to Washington D.C looking for work in international development. Started working for Ford Foundation Fellowship program-providing support to social justice organizations—it was “eye opening work”. For two years she supported “some really cutting edge work” that was happening in supporting international development. Became aware of racial injustice, income disparity, gender inequality also in USA--shifted her own framework. Was in DC from 2000-2002---9/11 attack and backlash against brown communities situated her differently-went from being an international student to a brown immigrant, “regardless of how I saw myself the world around me saw me as an immigrant.” This shift also affected her thinking and her identity and made her want to work with immigrants, especially South Asians and that brought her to New York city after grad school. 00:07:58 Worked at a small non-profit organizing workers---met Nepalis went she went to restaurants and got into cabs, but realized no one knew that the community was growing, “under the radar.” Many conversations with friends on how to offer help, connect the community to resources led to Adhikaar in 2005. Started with 3 friends and ended up running until “three weeks ago.” 00:9:55 New York for her: Came here for undergrad, but thought she would go back. But things were bad at home in Nepal. Practically a Civil war. Family didn't want her to come back to a volatile setting. Father's political connections would have put her in harm's way. So decided to stay-continue working with immigrants because immigrants and opportunity to connect to community. Once she decided to stay longer , she wanted to find a place where she could “have more roots.” Didn't want to sit in fancy office and “parachute in” but wanted to be part of community.” Coming to New York felt at home in America for the first time—diversity, vibrance, pace—especially since coming to Jackson Heights which feels like home. 13:05 Beginnings of Adhikaar: not the big organization it has become. Nepalis not recognized in government studies, interviewed but dropped from the final study. Didn't want the community to become statistically insignificant. Talking to Nepali people in Jackson Heights realized people not being paid their wages, people afraid to go to the doctor, not gone back home for a decade. Decided to do something about it. Couldn't find an organization to partner with. Started in 2005. No money. It meant going to Jackson Heights with backpack “portable office” and talking to “anyone” who would talk to her. Listening to people is how it started. Then finding leaders in the community. First donation was $500 dollars. They thought their first year budget would be $5K and they would grow by “1K” a year. Things really took off, instead. But org. arrived at a time of unmet need, when people were ready to “take action.” Now 11 and half years. Always thought she would leave when the organization was strong. Now the organization is in a very strong position, so she's leaving. Ready for the “next generation of leaders.” 20:05 Talks about having interviewer and family leaving close by has made a difference, creating a “cocoon” of support system like back at home in Katmandu. 23:24 Queens for her is Jackson Heights---used to be Indian, “Indian restaurants, indian clothing stores, Indian jewelry stores.” Slowly changing-fascinating to see evolution, with Bhutanese, Nepali, Bangladeshi communities coming up. First only Indian restaurants, now 4 momo trucks, wealth of Nepali restaurants to choose from. Census doesn't capture Nepalis—thinks there are 6K Nepalis in NYC. But 20 Nepali restaurants are a better indicator of Nepali population and numbers. Nepali community also beginning to move out-jackson heights is the “landing place.” The community was in Woodside, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights but is creeping East. 27:02 Community is changing. Used to be people who came for higher studies, but now older, middle-aged people also coming—leaving families behind. Experience “downward mobility” in NYC. Used to be single immigrants, but now families, starting to see chain migration, multi-generational, seniors coming. That leads to problems- for instance now Adhikaar has to provide childcare during programming. Community is now beginning to think of America as home—not a temporary place. Now Nepalis outside New York beginning to be politically involved, run for office and so on. 31:28 Talks about personal change as a leader and growing more comfortable in her role and “occupying this visible space.” As an introvert it hasn't been easy because she lives and works in Jackson Heights. But eventually got used to being “in the public eye.” Biggest change is “acknowledging” her leadership role. Over the years, understood different types of leadership required and nuances of leading. Challenging because of patriarchal society—started out as the only vocal woman in many rooms, youngest woman in many rooms---but have gained respect from men and women in the community. 35:06 talks about changing relationship to Nepal. Officially a US Citizen after 20 years. Doesn't believe in nation-states, but for her working with a group that is “loosely defined as coming from a particular country or region” has always been about representation for marginalized communities. Relationship to homeland is complicated. Have strong ties but homeland is also a place where as a woman, someone in an intercaste marriage, she was made to feel “subpar” all her life. Also official Nepali constitution doesn't give women, marginalized communities equal rights. Makes “no sense in 2015.” And that was a “breaking point with Nepal as a state.” That's when she sought American citizenship. Still, when earthquake hit, she threw herself into fundraising and so feelings about Nepal complicated, “depends on the day you ask.” 39: 56: What's next is “no obligations.” Trying to make sense of last eleven and half years of her life. Trying to understand what is “Luna Ranjit without Adhikaar.” Prepared for “Adhikaar without Luna Ranjit” for so long, but now time to understand “where I stand, what excites me, and where I can add most value.” ",

  "Reinhold_Lotte-EviIglaur_timecode.txt": "In this interview, sisters Lotte Reinhold and Evi Igaluer spoke about their similar experiences growing up in Briarwood, Queens and what kinds of hardship and prosperity they had. They talked about their experience living in Germany at a young age and how the war affected their lives and they had to migrate to other countries. 00:00:57 Lotte Reinhold was born in June 21, 1928 in small town in Germany called Bambarj in a hospital. Evi Igaluer was born in May 5, 1932 was born somewhere near Bambarj, but born in a home. 00:01:52 their father is Steven Igaluer and he lived in Bambarj where they were born in. He owned a shoe factory, which their grandfather had started before him. In 1938, when Hitler had power, they were forced to leave and they had to stay in a small apartment. However, their father had to stay because he still had some unfinished job to do at the shoe factory and someone else bought the shoe factory around that time. 00:03:13 On Kristallnacht, which was in November 30, their father was arrested and was kept in prison for a couple of weeks when Lotte was 10 years old and Evi was 6 years old. They had to let people go that fought in WW1, which their father fought in WW1. They let their father go, but, in exchange, they wanted their family to leave Germany as soon as possible. 00:04:00 they went to Jewish School in Munich for a while, because it was destroyed during the Kristallnacht. They stayed in London for a year to wait for the quota and they needed to borrow money from people who their father knew about in Cincinnati because they couldn’t take any German money. 00:05:29 their mother was in another small town. Her parents were part of Orthodox Jewish family. Her father was cattle dealer. She had 3 brothers: one of them died in WW1, and the other two both came to United States. She usually visited relatives in Munich there with her father. 00:06:24 their father and mother got married in June 27, 1927. 00:07:54 they started school in London, they both had a difficult time speaking English. The school where they used to go to together, closed due to the war. Evi and Lotte didn’t really have any educational experience until they went to United States. 00:08:49 when they went to United States, they went to Middletown NY. They moved there because their uncle was brought up in Germany in a Cattle business, so he started a farm in upstate. So, in order for them to make some money, they needed to take some guests in their summer boarding house. They came to the States in the beginning of June in 1940 to help their uncle with their parents. 00:10:03 their parents weren’t city people because they grew up in a small town. Their parents got factory jobs. Their mother was a sewing machine operator and their father worked in a laundry factory. 00:10:52 around that time, their grandparents passed away before they left Germany. In the beginning in moving to the states, it was difficult for them because they were foreigners/refugee. They were getting bullied because of their race and it caused a conflict with them going to school. 00:13:30 after Lotte graduated high school; she went to New York and stayed with her aunt and uncle. She didn’t know anything about college back then. She got an office job later in Manhattan in 1946. Unfortunately, her mother got sick in 1948 and she had to go back help her at home. When she came back home, she got a temporary job as a type writer for the State Department (Department of Health). 00:14:46 Lotte met her husband at a group called the New World Club, where people for Germany and Austria meet up and have fun. They got married in 1950 and they moved in New York and they moved in an apartment through their cousin. 00:16:30 Lotte got a job from Social Security Administration and she worked there for about 30 years, until when she retired in 1985. 00:17:00 her mother insisted Evi to go to college. Back then, there was free tuition in the State University, which she was able to go to college. She was the valedictorian from her high school so she got a scholarship. She went to Albany State University. She joined a Jewish sorority where she made a lot of friends. 00:18:14 Albany State University was Teacher College and when it came to student teaching, Evi hated it. Evi got her masters in Library Science because she didn’t want to become a teacher. She, then, got a job in a high school, Sowanic High School in Floral Park and she wanted to live in the city, so she got a room in Jamaica. 00:19:55 their neighborhood back then was Jewish/American neighborhood, where it had people who were in middle class. Now, Asian people are starting to move in to the neighborhood. 00:23:21 their neighborhood now changed like the stores have changed depending on the majority of the race that lives there. There have been a lot of religious Jewish people that live there. 00:24:07 they don’t have any long-term friends that live there anymore. They believe that their stage of their lives, they are losing more and more friends. However, they currently still have some friends in their lives that they talk to. 00:25:03 Lotte always wanted to live in Manhattan; however, her husband liked living in Queens. So Lotte usually goes to Manhattan sometimes and she wishes to stay there longer if she wanted to. 00:28:12 Evi started as high school librarian in Nasser County then her colleague tried to convince her that she is better off in New York City School System. So she took the test and started to work in the New York City School System. But she realized that she made a very big mistake because she going to get less money than she did before when she worked in the Nasser County. 00:29:15 Evi decided to go to Law School. In 1980, she went to St. Johns University and she worked in high school. She graduated St. Johns University in 1984. However, she had difficulties finding a job due to her old age, so she stayed in the school system till her 50th birthday. Then she retired in her 55th birthday. 00:30:02 her brother-in-law got her a job in Port Washington and Evi didn’t really liked practicing law for her career. She, then, got a job as a law firm in Forest Hill, NY. All of her friends, at that time, retired already, and she was still working very hard. 00:32:29 Lotte was working for Social Security Administration in Jackson Heights, Queens. She worked in a clerical job. She took a test to get a better position and she became Claims Representative. She, then, got promoted at the central office, where she became a supervisor for the Reconsideration Department in Lefrak City. 00:33:40 Lotte wanted to get another job but she had no time. 00:33:54 Evi and Lotte went back to Germany recently 5 to 6 years ago and she went back to the small town that was their home. Since there were so young back then when they lived in Bambarj, they didn’t have any happy memories that they remember. Everything was still intact in the town. 00:39:00 Evi and Lotte still knows how to speak German, but not that often. They only speak it when they really need to like when they go to Germany and they want to talk to people who only know how to speak in German. 00:45:14 Evi and Lotte believes these days neighborhoods have been breaking down houses and replacing them with luxury apartments is a problem because the neighborhood will become congested, even the roads have become congested with traffic, which is unsafe for the bikers in the area because cars sometimes go in that lane in order for them to skip the traffic and cars park on the service roads. 00:48:15 Evi and Lotte hear that Charter schools and Public Schools aren’t being paid enough and not pay any attention to the kids, which is also another problem for the neighborhood. But they also think that some of schools are doing pretty well even with the conflict that public education is facing. 00:49:00 Evi and Lotte has always been happy living in Queens, even though the subway system is getting worse. They both worked in Queens in Social Security Administration and they don’t regret it. 00:50:00 Evi and Lotte worked in the movie theater in high school, and then one of them worked as a baby sitter and one of them worked in the factory, which was a bad experience.

Reuder also served as head of the American Psychological Association, has won numerous awards, authored articles and books and is named in Who’s Who. Though she stopped driving in 2012, she is still reading and living in Shohola, PA. Reuder_02261986_A [Reuder_Mary_by_Weidman_Bette_02261986_Pt1] 00:00:00 Tape test 00:00:22 Coming to Queens was serendipity. Husband had gotten job and Adelphi and decided to get out of government. He had been working for military and she was doing lots of things. 00:00:54 Started job hunting and he got job at Adelphi so started looking in New York. 00:01:01 At APA meeting met Greg Razran who was seeking substitute because Dr. Winnick was on maternity leave. 00:01:23 Dr. Winnick (Wilma) was in same masters program at Brown University even though she was a native to New York and Reuder was a native of Minnesota. 00:01:33 Delighted to take job but was only for one semester. 00:01:41 Dr. Razran found night teaching for her for spring semester but it didn’t pay as well and could not carry as much. 00:01:57 Job hunting like mad at same time in ’54, ’55. 00:02:08 In between was substitute for Emma Spaney for a year along with full time night teaching and summer school. 00:02:28 Greg went to talk to Dean Garvey and found out about Ford Foundation grant about university self evaluation vs. external evaluations. Queens College was to do a study of non-academic functions for this. 00:02:59 He was looking for faculty person to be research director for grant so worked for Tom Garvey. 00:03:11 Got to know all about plant and grounds and how it worked, bylaws, who did what, hierarchy at a university, payroll, purchasing, registrar functions – everything except academics. 00:03:55 Made trip to Philadelphia to Bryn Mawr because they had one of the best buildings and grounds setups in the area. Hoping to make Queens College look pretty like Bryn Mawr but it wasn’t exactly successful. 00:04:23 There was a committee but was running day to day procedures. There were various faculty members on the beginning which allowed interaction with people from so many departments. 00:04:44 Original lawyer George Schwartz from the Accounting Department was on the committee. Donald Kirkpatrick, Ed Thorndike from Physics. 00:04:58 Found out about college rule concerning Psychology orders of electrical equipment that it had to be approved by Physics department because they didn’t trust psychologists. 00:05:12 Startled when they found out could troubleshoot cathode ray oscilloscope and offered job 00:05:32 Lasted a semester and a summer. Money ran out September 1 but stayed on and finished getting report out. 00:05:45 Working on finishing report, Cal Gorian had just been hired. Were working in Jefferson Hall and printing equipment was in attic. Roof was leaking because hurricane had started. 00:06:04 Cal would go up to the attic to get the report which was about 300 pages. Every once in a while he would say Oops! Have to do it again and would drop stencil in the trap door from the attic and would go and type it again because the water from the roof would have ruined the stencil or master. 00:06:38 Memory of day: when walked off campus through the back gate on Melbourne, the water was up to my waist. It was a hurricane. 00:06:54 Was September of 1955. 00:06:59 Knows of one locked up copy of report: in her file cabinet. All copies were numbered and kept under tight security. They contained a lot of sensitive recommendations. A lot of people gave up confidential information on how things did and didn’t work. Sometimes it was personality but often it was procedure would be effective only if you had the right personality. 00:07:40 Not good administration. Procedure should be effective no matter who is involved. Many of these nuances in the report. There were many suggestions that if put into effect all at once would have started a rebellion. 00:08:00 Queens was still a four year college at the time. Kirkpatrick came along and recommended buying stock in a duplicating process - the one of the future. The company was Xerox. 00:08:36 The College used a thing called Ozlet. There was one of those giant rollers in Jefferson Hall and it could make direct copies very laboriously and tediously. It was restricted for music department use to make multiple copies for the chorus and bands and things. They didn’t want it going haywire. 00:09:05 The rest of us dependent on photocopy or thermal copies which faded after two weeks in the light. Thought Ozlet machine was going to be vast improvement. But registrar had it under lock and key and only allowed Music Department to use it. 00:09:35 Minored in Secretarial Studies in college. One requirement was Business Administration. Indexing and Filing concentrated on classification of material. Combined with work done for Navy – got PhD there were no jobs. The Navy said you have all the requirements but we don’t hire women. 00:10:21 You might have to go to sea, on submarine. How many have? Well, never but that’s besides the point. Have to be able to. 00:10:32 Took Civil Service Test with the GSA for a typist job at Naval Ammunition Depot. Asked for one month employee for task completed in about four days. In 1951, year of PhD. 00:11:01 Finished everything so read Navy manuals on personnel, budget, guns, ammunition. Lieutenant asked if had done job analysis. Knew what it was because required course in Industrial Psychology when doing doctorate. Asked if she would do analysis of depot. Said analysis was no good if couldn’t make changes. He said he would renew job appointment every month and allow to go job hunting. In interest of Navy to have on board. Would provide chauffer and car in needed to get to interview. 00:12:13 Right outside Philadelphia. Fort Mifflin Naval Ammunition Depot. Don’t think it exists anymore. 00:12:23 Did job analysis of depot and conducted training program for employees to train them for new jobs they were better qualified for. Got upgraded. Civil Service Commission very unhappy because read the footnotes in manual to uncover criteria used to classify jobs. Once you know criteria, can write job description to fit criteria. 00:12:51 Went to APA meeting on Navy time. Had own little car and chauffer when visiting Civil Service Commission. Quite fun. 00:13:12 Wrote duty officers manual on depot on what Navy lieutenant should have to do if something happened on the base. Had temporary building with men’s room with urinals and wash basins on one side of partition and storage for nuclear ammo on other side. Ammo was the product. Had a machinist who was injured in military service. Had panic attack and pulled washbasins off the wall and slamming them against wall dividing them from nuclear ammunition. 00:14:31 Then had to get him into car and to hospital. Jumped out of car, smashed in hoods of cars. Had to write procedures for things like that. 00:15:01 Had done a lot of analysis of administrative processes and procedures. First job was hired as editor for Army because PhD males couldn’t write. Would walk around with shorthand book and ask what wanted to say and then copied down for report. 00:15:34 Civil Service said anybody with PhD should be able to write own reports. Don’t need editors. So turned editors into other things. Became analytical statistician. Wrote up instructions for data analysis combining use of IBM machine and calculators and operators. 00:16:02 Colonel asked for help. Put to work as administrative assistant for plans for response to military attack. How to operate without power. Had cave in North Carolina for equipment. 00:16:40 Were part of army that created diagnostic tests for personnel, officer selection. Had to determine which sample copies of these tests would be saved. Couldn’t store all but wanted samples to re-duplicate if needed. 00:17:11 Had to think of manual typewriters, manual mimeograph machines, manual everything - much of which was already going off the market – and work out plan for emergency quarters underground. 00:17:38 Finished that and at end was reviewing grant completions to see if they had met requirements. Then quit and came to Queens. 00:17:56 These skills were used in that very first Queens job. 00:18:02 After that – hard to remember – full time substitute and full time adjunct. One semester carried 23 credits teaching, combining day and night. No that was on first full time. 00:18:39 Then Gregory Razran, chairman of Psychology Department – was a mentor – called. Was simultaneously looking for something permanent. 00:18:58 Razran said Board of Trustees thinking of full time night jobs. If we get any, would you like one? Sure. Never said no. Got three calls same day. One from Gregory telling me he’d been over to Herb Schuler and Psychology Department had job and could have it. Next came from Cornell Medical downtown. Had job supervising clinical interns and teaching in that school. 00:19:44 Hunter College called and offered second staff assistant professorship. The job at night at Queens was instructor. 00:19:57 Took it because she and Marvin (husband) had one child and didn’t want t be dependent on babysitters. Not from this region, had no informal contacts. Didn’t know how to even go about finding housekeeper or cleaning person. This is kind of thing in own hometown that aunt, cousin, lady across street feeds you information on. 00:20:37 Could work nights while Marvin worked days and take care of kids and still get ahead on careers. That’s why took job. School of General Studies at Queens was a nothing. Consisted of handful of courses that contributed to two-year degree. A student who wanted four-year degree had to transfer to City College after two years. 00:21:!1 In department, practically nothing other than education courses, Psych 1 was terrible. Gregory said School of General Studies is yours. Do what you want with it. Meant Psychology Department, not school although at one point felt like whole school. 00:21:43 Was the start. Discovered students had need for four-year degree. Wanted to know what to do. She pointed out that had to accept credits from one city college to another though not yet university. 00:22:12 Suggested take all requirements for two-year degree and then take required courses for major for electives. Would be well along when they got into four-year program without wasting time. Some took numbers in courses beyond two-year degree and never went to City College. Were already lower seniors in some cases, ready to roll. 00:22:54 Got bachelor’s degree in one September and had kids graduating in January because had planned ahead and worked with them on schedules. 00:23:21 Was plan of day Psychology Department but had to think of minimum essentials, no fancy courses that other schools had. Evening program was second-class citizen in eyes of world and seems to be characteristic nationwide. 00:24:10 Because labor market in New York is unlimited, required PhD for anyone teaching night program and might take masters if desperate but only for one term and they would be first to go if enrollment dropped. 00:24:30 Even though PhD is no guarantee of teaching ability, it is guarantee of exposure to discipline. The fact that all professors were doctors made evening students feel good about their situation. They could be proud of their degree. 00:25:02 It was a case of acquiring power, too. After the program had been built, she discovered there were problems running labs and the department didn’t want to share apparatus so began demanding share of budget to buy equipment. Got hunk of money to buy psychological tests and cabinets for storage. Was harder to get lab equipment but did ultimately. Figured it would be cheaper if only one set of equipment needed. 00:25:52 But then couldn’t have syllabus requiring everyone do same all at same time. Redesigned course in experimental psych and other things and volunteered to be on department curriculum committee. Dean had asked her to represent him on college curriculum committee. He didn’t have time to go to meetings. Dean of School of General Studies. He had five full time faculty. 00:26:32 Schuler left six months after to become president of Staten Island she thinks or one of those schools. She got along famously with Glen Howard who gave her everything she wanted. 00:27:00 Experimental Psych course was completely different. Accomplished same goals in different manner. Put anything that didn’t need special equipment into lecture prerequisite course. Divided lab course into sections. One was on sensation and perception and one was on learning, thinking and so on. 00:27:31 Kids were told that they worked in groups and had to done one experiment in each area and an original experiment. Had all this equipment. Gave them science fair night so they could see what they had and how it worked. You can do what you want. Dream one up, go to library. Look at what somebody else did and copy it. Can go to day session and ask kids what they did for their lab reports. Repeat that. She didn’t care. Had to do one in each of the fields. 00:28:04 It worked fantastically well because they studied what they dreamed up and wanted to study. 00:28:17 Example: Day session had syllabi which said something like: Reaction Time. There will be experimenter, observer and subject. Take reaction time equipment. Do thus and such, record milliseconds, told what statistics to use, answer following questions. 00:28:56 If her students chose to study reaction time, they decided what equipment, visual verbal or what kind of reaction time. No questions, no guide to request statistics to use. Collected data and figured out how to analyze it, analyzed it and interpreted it. Didn’t write nearly as many reports as the day program because the day had a different syllabus, each week following directions. 00:29:33 She doesn’t think you get far teaching people to follow directions. Supposed to be able to do that when they get to college. Really creating own directions. It was very stressful, requires masochistic reading of the reports because you have to give students feedback. 00:29:52 For first reports, it would take as much as six or seven hours per report to grade them. It failed when she couldn’t find people willing to put that much time in. 00:30:10 Six hours of reading reports is a lot. Faculty are well meaning BUT. Can require this commitment from full time faculty but for part time faculty this was getting into masochistic teaching. Depends on faculty member. 00:30:43 Course was in place until 1975 crunch, about eight or ten years. Started in 1958 or 1959 and ran until 1975. 00:31:27 Her main contribution was that they set up a solid bachelor’s major of quality so that Queens students got scholarships, fellowships – sometimes more – than the day students. Was reaching a point where day students were transferring into the evening presenting a diplomatic problem. It got recognized to the point that she got phone calls from other universities asking what the model was and what it was like. Students went off into the world. 00:32:16 They were good. Had problems outside department. Honors committee never met in evening when students who were working full time could get there. One instance applying for Danforth fellowship. The committee in the day had set rules. Students were supposed to be reviewed by them and they approved applicants. She knew nothing since they didn’t overlap. But submitted papers for fellowship and her student won. 00:32:59 When it came through, committee was shocked because they didn’t know it had been applied for. 00:33:20 Requirement of original experiment was not unique to evening program. Day also required it. Found that when sat down with students and said to forget copying what someone else did, isn’t there something about people or behavior that’s kind of puzzled you? One student said noticed that when it comes to intelligence tests that she’s better on numerical than verbal. 00:33:59 Tell you to do the kind your best at first so I zip through and then get lower score on numerical so I get lower score on numerical because I do verbal first. Wonder if works for people in general. She said you have an idea! 00:34:17 Now need more variables. One is numerical versus verbal. Another is are they embedded – one verbal problem and then a numerical then verbal then numerical or do you separate into two kinds. But need another variable. 00:34:45 Student couldn’t think of any. She said three variables interested in: anxiety, locus of control – which is personality dimension – and one known as field dependency which is perceptual dimension. If interested in any one, free to use it. She would give her questionnaire to use for it. Will not add or subtract from grade if use her variables. If used, she was interested in it. 00:35:!9 Research got organized around variables. After kids turned them in, proceeded to reanalyze data herself. Kids would get special letters in middle of summer saying if you’re willing to do x, y, z, she was willing to work with them and sponsor as paper for EPA. Became famous. EPA papers are read blind for acceptance. Bulk come from doctorate level people on east coast. 00:35:58 Became famous. Every EPA they would have four or five papers on the program. Twice her students won papers for best paper where principle was undergraduate student. After that they changed prize because hers kept winning all the time and it became known as the Mary Reuder prize. This was not such a good idea. 00:36:29 Then she would write the articles and submit for publication making student first author. In fact for most of her publications she is not first author for simple reason that these were undergraduates whom she felt had done bulk of work. She was entitled because she provided sophistication, did writing, submitted, resubmitted, re-wrote it. 00:37:05 Solved one problem of relating teaching to research by combining the two all the while doing administration. 00:37:16 Yes, running program. Would start department meetings at 11pm. One night was terrible. Program grew. At end she had five full time faculty in department. Would have full time faculty meetings regularly and one or two a semester of the adjunct faculty. 00:37:49 They were remarkable. That was before union would have said they had to be paid for it. They could come in on holidays, any time to have meeting and get information, to get organized. Key to running department with adjuncts is to make adjuncts feel they are part of the department. Adamantly insisted that they have a vote on required textbooks in courses that was going to be crossing day and night. Adamantly insisted that if content of statistics course was going to be modified that people have as much vote as day staff people. 00:38:26 When department killed off in 1975, had arithmetic mean of 9.8 years of service. Some of them had eighteen years of service. Regularly, year after year with no breaks. Those people in many ways were integrated part of department as full time faculty. 00:38:57 That was a sore point. Kept insisting that day people acknowledged night adjuncts. They didn’t want to. 00:39:06 Do you know anyone else who has had that kind of a career that’s combined teaching, research and administration from the moment of from the inception of a teaching career? 00:39:22 Mmm-mmm. I don’t and part of it is because beginners are very rarely given the opportunity to administer anything. At once point I had been promoted. I had been an assistant professor. I had been working quite a while and Greg Razran called and said ‘How are your publications coming?’ I told him. He said, ‘We better put your up for promotion because you built something there. Someone’s going to come along and say a man should be running this. And they won’t dare say it so they’ll say your rank is too low. An assistant professor shouldn’t be running empires like you’ve got.’ 00:40:04 So then he got her promoted. Which was never a problem. 00:40:09 How long an assistant professor until promoted? 00:40:13 Terminally, it seemed. About five to seven years. Thought it was long. In each rank. Except associate was longer than that. 00:40:40 Had publications. Came in as instructor but at same time qualified for second step assistant professor. Had publications and kept turning them out. 00:40:58 Liked the evening schedule so she could be at home. Also a night owl. One who is awake at night. Not functionally very literate in the morning. 00:41:18 At lunch we were talking. Phone rang. Was in middle of pointing out the lack of faculty development. One of the things faculty development consists of is taking new people and short-cutting orientation to school. Not in form of orienting sessions. Not meetings of faculty and telling them what all the rules are. Nonsense. Tell them how to go about. Informal power structure. 00:41:56 How to handle better. Had new faculty who came in just as took over as chairman last year. Keeps commenting, ‘You know the practical answer to everything, everywhere to turn.’ Had been struggling to get lab organized. Had gotten her the money. Norm Goldman was very helpful there. 00:42:27 Had terrible problem with air conditioning and heating system. Overheating or freezing. She had managed to get local buildings and grounds guys over to help. Very clear that the problem was beyond their ability to handle, beyond their authority to handle. Didn’t know where to go next. 00:42:51 Called up Jack Telfer, told him story, told him problem and asked him who to go to. He said ‘let instructions come from me.’ 00:43:03 She’s standing there listening. She found out who does it, how you do it and little subtle political nuance. 00:43:15 You found out when you first came from doing that report? 00:43:19 Yes. Part through that report. Even though school changed and moved from four year college to a branch of a university and organizational pattern shifted. Different people in different titles did different things. Functions remained. 00:43:38 Theobald was president when did that report. Theobald was followed by Tom Garvey for a while as acting president. Tyling was acting (president) very briefly. Then came Joe McMurray and Murphy. All those people read private copies of report and implemented different parts. Could watch implementation. 00:44:15 Recommendations on locks and keys for instance were inserted. Personally got legal permission to charge fees for parking. Initially could do nothing about parking with no money. City flatly refused to contribute money for parking. Problem was it wasn’t in writing anywhere. Couldn’t legally charge fees. 00:44:44 Had to get statement from City’s attorneys downtown – this was still four year college – so board of higher ed’s attorneys. Famous for being unwilling to commit themselves to anything on paper. Will tell you over phone. Won’t put on paper. 00:45:05 ‘Oh, am sure you will have no problem!’ ‘would you put that in writing please?’ ‘Oh yeah, I’ll get it out tomorrow.’ It reached point – had already been told about this “tomorrow” stuff – finally had secretary alert her every single morning at 9:15 – between 9:15 and 11 – made a call to these guys asking for permission to charge for parking. Took three months. 00:45:45 At end of three months, letter arrived. They didn’t want to hear from her again. 00:45:50 Sounds as if when you took teaching job at Queens, you took sense of whole institution? The classroom wasn’t a separate place. Connected to everything. 00:46:09 If you want to make most out of institution, have to master whole institution and place in it. Then you can be as powerful as you want. Not enough. Also have to go beyond institution. Not famous psychologist but every person in Eastern Psych Association knows who she is. 00:46:35 Have been active, giving papers, having students give papers, serving committees, chairing sessions for past thirty years. American Psych Association, very active in two divisions. Reuder_02261986_B [Reuder_Mary_by_Weidman_Bette_02261986_Pt2] 00:00:00 We were developing an area no one else has in the impact on behavior of toxic chemicals. This can range from fear, anxiety and stress reaction to nuclear waste. Can include things like this Tylenol business. Can include Agent Orange. He (?) was involved in agent orange as an expert witness. Yet doesn’t know anyone he can call on in sponsors because he’s worked this out with the aides in non-psychology fields. 00:00:48 Told him to go to APA and go to business meetings. Nobody goes to business meetings except visible people and only handful. They’re the only ones who give a darn whether budget gets approved. 00:01:04 By going tot hem, maybe he’ll find that he’s appreciated because they need bodies. They will talk to them and he will get to know these people and become a more active member of the association. Told a number of her own faculty this last year. 00:01:24 Haven’t had new faculty in eons except the one person because of the budget and all that and most of these people should have known this for years. Didn’t. Don’t know anything. How did you get to know all this? It was natural. 00:01:49 Any models from your past? 00:01:58 Thing there are a number of things. One: went to small college. All faculty knew each other, interacted, administrative decisions jointly involved entire college. Therefore role model of institution was partly shaped. 00:02:28 The College of Saint Catherine. Catholic school for women, college for women. In Minnesota? 00:02:35 Yep. New York times had an article where they noted its incredible proportion of professional women who have gone on to – I never got one – Fulbrights and fellowships. She was first PhD Psychologists. 00:03:02 Since those days, dozens and dozens. Philosophy was you want broad base, secure center not to Catholic Universities but to universities of the world that had outstanding women in their disciplines. If you wanted to study French, sent to Sarbonne. English, literature, were sent to Oxford. And similarly. 00:03:49 When it came to psychology, the University of Minnesota was as good as any, was next door, cheaper, so why not? Was it in college that you decided on psychology? 00:03:58 That was funny. Was accident. Was poli-sci major. Came in as wide-eyed naïve green freshman. Didn’t know how to think. Required to take five hours a week course. One hour every day in social science survey, in some ways analogous to what Queens used to call Survey of Western Civilization. 00:04:29 Three quarters required five hours a week. Was integrated combination of economics, history, and political science, taught by woman who had degree in poli-sci from Duke and had been Brookings Fellow and had minor in economics. 00:04:46 Don’t know how she did it. She couldn’t. She taught class of close to 80 students using Socratic method. Did in way. She had never been stimulated before like that to go out and study related material on own. She would lecture and it would dawn on her that it would be helpful if knew something about sequence of all these kings and queens and rest. 00:05:42 Went home and got out high school history books, outlined and memorized them so that she could be more proficient. Same with governments in Russia and all rest. Edna Flagel. Magnificent teacher. 00:06:03 Couldn’t say she was role model in sense that couldn’t use that method. Not gifted enough in handling of discussion. Found psychology in her course? No didn’t find psychology at all. 00:06:20 Found political science – first time in life. Didn’t know what it was until then. Ended up taking twenty-one credits a quarter because sneaking in courses for seniors only when freshmen. Had major done when sophomore. By end of sophomore year had all the courses required for major done in political science. 00:06:47 She let her in to senior seminars, all these required things that you weren’t even supposed to be able to get in to. Began looking for things to take. Word was out that there was new teacher in psychology. Had had one required course in psych. Ghastly. Most awful teacher there ever was. Lovely woman but couldn’t teach. 00:07:14 Had decided to end psychology. No need in life. Along came new teacher, just finished PhD at University of Minnesota, Sr. Annette. Was beautiful woman. Born counselor. Word was out. Small school. She was offering course called experimental psychology. Sounded interesting. 00:07:54 Had several prerequisites, none of which she met, which was challenge. Went and talked way into course, not realizing they were desperate for ten students and she was tenth. Hindsight tells you many things about your childhood history. 00:08:17 Took course. Neat. She was model for what became E19 course at Queens many years later. She had lab, new lab, not much equipment. Had whole term of lab manuals, had to do about ten experiments in different lab manuals. Had to pick out and do, work with what you’ve got. 00:08:58 Had been interesting, 5 hour – yes, five credit course, including lab. Decided to take other one that goes with it, Clinical Psych. Then figured that if took Stat and took a couple of other courses, could have major in psych. So collected major in Psych. 00:09:28 One required course – interestingly enough – you would never have gotten out of a secular institution. Was called Thomistic Psychology. Basically was philosophy of Aqunias applied largely to behavior. Concept of habit. For example, to what extent is person morally responsible for behavior that takes place as a habit. 00:09:59 Before habit starts, control over whether you get habit. These kinds of questions, basic core questions of philosophy. It was there that she learned what the basic core questions of philosophy were. Fellow (unintelligible) taught by priests, got nowhere. Course was fantastic. 00:10:25 Author of book was famous Robert Brennan. Turned out to be bigwhig at Providence College in Providence Rhode Island. Went to Brown and looked him up and he invited her over. Another experience. 00:10:44 He tried to talk her into becoming a psychiatrist. Offered tuition free – facilities at Providence College to pay for pre-med requirements. Had arrangement worked out. Said Catholic Church had been missing not sponsoring enough among laity. Worked out deal where group of physicians were willing to sponsor, one on one, full fellowships to medical school. 00:11:21 You in turn agreed, when got practice going, would sponsor another person through medical school in similar fashion. He would line that up for her if she wanted to become psychiatrist. Could finish masters at Brown at same time. 00:11:40 Gave it careful thought and decided too late. Gotta stay, gotta make a decision somewhere. Had already shifted majors. Couldn’t have been more than 24? 00:11:58 Was twenty-one by the time she left St. Catherine’s. Twenty-one in March because I’d loaned it before I left home to go to grad school. When it came to becoming psychologist, talk about mature decision-making. Was graduating with a major in Poli-sci and another one in Psych and a minor in Secretarial Studies and another one in English. All Philosophy courses in the college she had taken, except Philosophy of Ed. Wouldn’t let her in because wasn’t Ed major. 00:12:37 Friend Carol Pasendack who has degree and is out in Minnesota was a class behind. Finished all requirements for BA in three years but didn’t have senior Philosophy and that was requirement for graduation. Would not allow philosophy from heathen place like University. No substitute for their great philosophy course which was taught by Ed Farriss. 00:13:10 Carol figured out that a famous philosopher had come to St. Cate’s to do a speech. Went and talked with him and he said he’d let her in to his philosophy course. No problem. Then she want to officials of St. Catherine’s and they had special meeting of faculty. Agreed that in this instance, this bigwhig’s philosophy course would satisfy requirement. 00:13:36 Got herself assistantship at Fordham. Said didn’t want to go East by herself. Gotta find somewhere for her to go to grad school and she said, what’s grad school? Was first college graduate in her family. Didn’t know about these things. Went to look a bulletin board. Only two things listed. 00:13:59 One was Brown University and the other was Catholic University. Providence looked right near New York on the map. Carol’s gonna be at Fordham and Washington wasn’t really that far away. Rode off with materials to schools. 00:14:15 Only one that replied was Brown. Sent all these forms. They wanted them in ten days. Was then February. Friend told her they’d get them all filled out. First to registrar because takes time to get transcripts out. That college went all gung ho for its graduates. 00:14:45 Had letters of recommendation, had transcripts had everything out by deadline and then some. Was very tight going. Kind of forgot about it. Busy. In college, there was quite a crew. About fifteen of them were scholarship students. College gave scholarship to valedictorian of any high school in the Twin Cities. 00:15:14 She and Carol found those were kids they were most interested in so formed a group. Joined every club on campus so each of them was president of something. Presidents of clubs were leaders of student government so that meant they ran student government too. 00:15:38 So they were very busy in the spring. One Saturday, mother called and said “you’ve got a terribly fat letter here from Brown University. Can I open it?” Said no. My letter. But her parents were going out for dinner. So she told her she’d call her mom and tell her what it said. 00:16:10 It had three things. I can’t remember what it said. One was she could be secretary of department on full salary and also carry same courses teaching assistant would with full tuition exemption. That was because she had the Steno. 00:16:33 Could be teaching assistant for fifty dollars a month and tuition remission. There was a third thing. Forgot what it was. Chose the TA, sent it off and called mother and told her. 00:16:59 When filling out forms for Brown, Carol asked which she was going to go for. Poli-sci, English or Psych? Had to think about it. Talked to herself. Could pick up a low-level magazine for articles she had written to catch eye and be interesting like Reader’s Digest, which do you read first? 00:17:30 Invariably read the psychological ones first, not ones in government or politics. Was pretty sure that Poli-Sci major was major in Edna Flagel and not in Political Science. Was terrific teacher. Just like minor in English was heavily a minor in Agnes Keenan. One of these who had degrees from several places, masters in history from somewhere. English from Oxford. PhD in English from Minnesota. 00:18:05 She had taken a great deal in art and music appreciation somewhere else. When you studied Dante, you had lecture on Giberti doors, on about Giberti and what the doors symbolize in art, their place in history. That kind of thing. 00:18:25 But your major in Psychology was not a major in Sister Annette? 00:18:35 No. The independent part of it, that she would read on her own more readily in the field. 00:18:48 Was there already a set of research interests that she had? When she went to Brown, went fresh? 00:18:58 No. Wrote forty term papers in college, full length, eighteen to twenty page papers with exhaustive bibliographies. Could write them like paper-writing machine. Would take file boxes down to public library with outlines for each paper. Would dredge information out onto file cards and sit down and bat out the final copy on typewriter at once. You write enough of them, it becomes mechanical. 00:19:31 Could do it in any subject. Which was the trouble. Biggest talent was in field of law. Turned down law in part because of guidance from father who said women would get nowhere except in law clerk jobs in back room doing support research. 00:19:58 Law was only subject she didn’t have to study. Could read it once and know it. Could read legal cases, read through and come to exam, fill it in, no problem. Turned down English because too easy. Didn’t have to work very hard to master anything anybody required of her in English courses. Whether poetry or writing or literature analysis. Was too easy. Sorry but this was the perspective of a college senior. 00:20:48 When it came to that blank on the Brown application, she filled in Psychology, not even knowing different universities emphasize different aspects of the discipline. Wanted to be clinical psychologist and finds herself in hotbed of behavioristic research psychology, which had no time for clinical anything. 00:21:15 They scorned it. They were so desperate for students, it being World War II, and women were being sought after by schools that had been very negative toward their existence prior to those days. Very glad to get them. 00:21:35 Five girls in her masters degree class and one man. Although a number of other guys who were ahead of them. 1944. Some guys ahead of them on military exemptions because working on clinical research projects. Deferred. 00:22:01 That’s where she met some of today’s famous psychologists. Many members of that group around that time. The professors they had up there are the ones whose names are on all the major books. 00:22:15 Wanted to be a clinician and they pointed out that even if you wanted to be a clinician, you have to take about the same course pattern anyway for a masters degree. It’s at the third year level and you can always transfer. Unlike present, desirable pattern was to take your three degrees in three different locations. 00:22:47 A masters from Brown was a good base from which to move elsewhere and it was not looked askance, what was the matter, like they wanted to get rid of you. When she left, Walter Hunter told her to always come back. 00:23:00 What was main influence from Brown? 00:23:08 Several. Walter Hunter was the chairman, when he was there -e spent most of the time in Washington working for the military – believed in liberal arts with a capital L. Took one look at her college transcript and said it was one of the most excellent humanities and social sciences he had seen. For free elective, take Math 1 with the freshmen. 00:23:38 For graduate credit. Friend Marie was in same program. Came running in gleeful because she had undergraduate bio-chem major and major in math and all the rest. He said it was an excellent record in the sciences and that she needed to take American History and Philosophy. 00:24:11 Each of them had pre-electives elected for every semester they were there. He left nothing to choice. He was the chairman, officially, of the Psychology Department. Psych was still a baby science in those days. Still very young. He was called upon by federal government to give them guidance on many problems. 00:24:47 One of them, for example, was the problem of merchant marine shipping that was going down as fast as it was leaving the ports. Not many people know that we nearly lost the war in the first six months. Our merchant marine was going out of the harbor and down to the bottom of the ocean. There was something making those ships terribly visible. Had big meeting in Washington and they called Walter, among other experts in. 00:25:21 So he said to look at the ships and see how they’re blacked out. They had little cups, all the lights so that they wouldn’t be seen, Just little lights poking down this way. Said these ships are visible for fifty miles. What’s the problem? Well under low lamination blue has highest visibility and they’re blacked out with blue lights. Change the light bulbs and put in red ones. 00:25:58 Red ones. Everyone knows red’s most visible, beware of the bull, color of danger. It took a command from the President of the United States to make them change the light bulbs. When they did, the shipping lost its route. Isn’t that interesting. 00:26:23 That’s why Walter wasn’t around much of the time. The Old Doc, as they used to call him. When he was around, no question he was senior person and chairman. The real day-to-day acting chairman who carried the title I guess was Harold Schlossberg. He was also a famous psychologist, one of the classic books on experimental. 00:25:53 What did you take away from Brown to the University of Pennsylvania? 00:26:59 He was the one that recognized that she was devoid in the sciences and she not only took math but comparative anatomy in vertebrates, physics one and two. In fact, after she got masters mid-year, he said to stay on and take additional courses. May or may not transfer. They were desperate. Can still remember one administrator commenting that it was at point that schools were competing for graduate assistance. 00:27:36 Really had a market for your talents. Didn’t even realize it. Stayed on a year after. Got masters in – September graduation and stayed on for a year. Went on down to Penn afterwards. 00:27:56 Took rest, took second semester of Math, second semester in Physics, took the seminars in Psychology that were being offered. Was just a TA (teaching assistant). Assisting. Grading papers. Was just nine hours a week. Walter would call you in a intervals to make sure you weren’t being exploited by a professor. He was very good. 00:28:28 Tuition was paid for and you had a stipend? Room and board so you could support yourself. 00:28:32 Oh yes. She was sixty dollars a month before taxes. You didn’t support yourself in very great style. I worked part-time at the state mental hospital giving psychological tests to kind of round out the income a little bit. 00:28:52 You were 23 years old when you went to University of Pennsylvania? How did you pick the University of Pennsylvania? 00:28:57 Yeah. Walter called her in one day and asked where she was going, what she wanted to do and if she still wanted to be a clinician. At that point, yes. Asked where she wanted to go, where she would like to end up. If in Catholic circles than do degree at Catholic University. That’s the feeder. That is one of the finest programs in clinical psych in the United States. 00:29:25 At that time they had Verner Moore there who was PhD in Psychology, had MD in neurology and was a Jesuit. One of them. He was the one who focused the department and when they build the department, you came out of there trained. 00:29:52 If she wanted to go to the far west, she could look into the California colleges. Didn’t want to go to Midwest. In that case, on East coast, Pennsylvania has the best clinical program. So applied to Penn and applied to Catholic U and knew someone at Catholic U. Had board, room, and tuition fellowship. Just one. It was allocated to her but director went off to Europe before he signed papers. 00:30:26 Meantime, Penn came through and offered TA and decent salary, of course, with tuition remission. Had applied to Michigan, too. Had to make decision and director wasn’t coming back. View was a bird in the hand so accepted Penn. 00:30:51 Got down there to find letter followed her and University of Michigan was offering more and a clinical fellowship. Went and saw chairperson and pointed out little tidbit. Penn paid on a ten-month basis. Brown paid on nine-month. Meant lump sum was divided differently. Didn’t realize she wasn’t getting as much money at Penn. Said she made a mistake and couldn’t afford it. 00:31:32 In meantime, Michigan has offered this so going to go to Michigan. Asked her to give him a day or two to think about it. Called her in and said if they gave her assistant instructorship, with a higher salary, of course, would she stay? If they matched Michigan. Said sure, save the move if nothing else. So they matched Michigan. So she stayed. 00:32:07 Most but not all credits transferred from Brown. Had to take some of their required courses. In the course of going through clinical program - which she did complete - found that she had been contaminated with research. Well the Brown program really had. 00:32:31 As she began working – Walter was very much in favor of well-trained clinicians. He tried to get many of the research guys to take some clinical training. Said if people like her didn’t do the clinical research on the problems, who was going to do it? 00:32:48 Not a practitioner trying to make lots of money. At Penn, took whole VA required program for the Veterans Administration which was only criteria that existed at that time for clinical – courses in the Rorschach, working in practicums over in the hospital, all of that stuff. Also took the entire program in the experimental because it wasn’t that hard, just strategically selected free electives. 00:33:22 Did a doctoral presentation in physiological on a problem having to do with normal people. When she got to end, chairman called her in and asked what she was majoring in and if she wanted an internship. She said she didn’t because by then had discovered that working n the clinical situation she felt like she was doing surgery with a butcher knife. 00:33:51 The tools were so crude and there was little in way of solid, research data to get at the clinical art. No question that clinical practice is an art. Also no question that when you have an art, part of the art is the personality of that clinician and part of it is an unacknowledged base of information. 00:34:20 There was no literature to help guide as to which was which. By that point she decided that she wanted to get a job where she could do research on clinical problems and problems of the normal person coming into psychological difficulties, not necessarily pathology. There’s nothing like a job in a big mental institution to curb your morbid curiosity about pathology. 00:34:52 How long were you at Penn? Five years. 00:35:00 She got her degree in 1951. Went there in ’46. Part of that was her own fault. Started doing dissertation on topic which really didn’t interest her all that much. The topic that interested her was muscle action potentials, the tension in your arm when you work on a problem. There had been literature and she’d done a term paper on the topic showing there is a direct relationship between the amount of work you do and the amount of tension in your dominant forearm. And it’s on a gradient. 00:35:43 The non-dominant forearm shows the same picture but not as much, not as intensely. Your dominant leg and non-dominant leg, they go in that sequence. Thought it would be interesting to tie it into a theoretical viewpoint about psychological tension, this being muscular, to see if there was any relationship. 00:38:06 However, she didn’t have money to pay for fim and the technology was so crude. In those days you had to set up a camera and photograph the cathode ray oscilloscope -that jiggles and jaggles - moved and then get the film developed and then measure the film by hand. It’s like your approach on the information. You go the long way around where if it was all on computer – voom! 00:36:39 Today nobody in their right mind would approach a problem on muscle potential in that fashion. But in those days you did. Professor who saw here struggling away with this problem that she wasn’t gung ho on asked her what ever happened to her idea on muscle potential. 00:37:00 She said she gave it up because she didn’t think she could afford to do it. He said he would see if the department could afford to pay for it. It could and did. That’s how she did her dissertation. She wasted about a year struggling with how to formulate a problem in this other area and not getting anywhere. 00:37:29 Did you make correlation between muscular tension and the psychological. 00:37:33 Yeah! Yes, what was interesting was that if you took what was pretty well-established, the muscle tension represents mental work, mental effort. What they found is that when they used egal-threatening instructions – you know, your work on this is going to be put on your record and the dean is going to see it, and your psych professor is going to see it and it’s related to final grades in psychology, and all of this bologna – you could use things like that in those days but you can’t anymore. 00:38:09 Under that kind of a threatening instruction, they used as a problem some number progressions. Two-two-four-four. What comes next? On easy problems, the egal-threatening subjects works far harder than is necessary to solve the problem. The task-oriented subject works as hard as they need to. 00:38:42 When it comes to the extremely difficult problems - and they define difficult as the three professors could solve them using pencil and paper within five minutes, and these subjects have to solve them without pencil and paper. That was their definition of difficulty. When it came to difficult problems, the easy people exhibited almost no mental work. 00:39:17 The task-oriented people worked as hard – much harder – appropriate for the difficulty level of the problem. Was as though the people who had been egal-threatened just gave up. That fit the theory on what happens with psychological tension. That was her dissertation. 00:39:44 Interestingly enough both groups got the same number rights and wrong. Time spent on them probably would have shown a difference but she had to curtail the time on the difficult problems to five minutes on the click because of the fact that they were running very expensive movie film. 00:40:06 Have to remember they were using a thing that was called a decade resistance box. It was a controlled amount of resistance so that you could use it as a standard on the screen. You knew -you ran the electricity through a screen and the line jiggled this much – what its equivalent would be if there weren’t the box there. It was the people they were recording off of. It gave you a norm. 00:40:35 Well, this was in the ’40 and in the ’40 that box cost $1000 dollars. Today you can pick up a decade resistance box for five bucks. 00:40:50 From that work that you did for your dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania and the other studies you had there, from there you went to army job, right? What was the chief intellectual carryover? When you went to the Army job, what had you really learned at Pennsylvania that you thought you’d carried along? 00:41:19 What she thought she’d carried along that really worked, first of all, was her course in industrial psychology. Worked for Navy for a year first. That carried over in terms of the job analysis and all that stuff. 00:41:36 When she got down to the Army, there was no carryover in terms of content. There was carryover in that she knew of statistics, having taught it at Penn. That was another one. She was the world’s worst statistician and had not done that well in the courses. She came in one day to find out that it was Friday and effective Monday morning she would teach statistics. 00:42:01 She learned statistics the hard way. Why didn’t you go directly into college teaching? Why did you go to the Navy first? 00:42:15 There were no jobs. She was job-hunting and found herself competing with people like Stuart Cook who was chairman at NYU. She’d go to the interview table and there’s Stuart Cook interviewing on behalf of his graduate students for the few jobs there were. 00:42:34 There was also an incredible amount of chauvinism. They did not hire women and they would tell you because there was no law that they didn’t have to. It was extraordinarily difficult. There were jobs aplenty down at Lackland Airforce Base. Carol Straussberg used to call that the sinkhole for psychologists. 00:43:04 She didn’t want to go to Texas. She wasn’t married. She and Marvin went together for five years because if they had gotten married, one of them would not have had a degree. You know which it would have been. There was a nepotism rule at Penn and it went all the way down to graduate students and if you got married – well they wouldn’t have thrown you out, but she would not have had an assistantship. Is that where you met Marvin, at Penn? 00:43:33 Yep. He was a graduate student at the same time? He came in after she was there. He had two masters degrees. He got one at Minnesota in public personnel administration. Then he got a second one in industrial and social psychology along with his doctorate at Penn. 00:43:54 Even though you both came from Minnesota? They didn’t meet until they were at Penn. 00:44:00 They didn’t get married until they were both out and she was down in Washington. He was down there by that time, too. Married in Saint Matthew’s Cathedral. That’s the great big Roman Catholic cathedral. It was my parish church. Monstrous place. It’s huge. One thing they had that was lovely was that the side altar where they were married – Marv loved it because it was done in such perfect taste. 00:44:36 Frequently in cathedrals it’s all this gold and bleeding hearts and stuff. But this particular altar was a grotto-like effect and the entire back wall was a mosaic in cerulean blue and gold. And it had a plain, white marble altar. And up above was a statue of the Virgin done in white marble. All white. 00:45:02 Nothing else. Just stunning from the point of view of art as well as religion. That had quite a history. She used to stop off and see the chapel whenever she was in Washington or nearby. One year she was a consultant for the National Science Foundation on some program and they had them at the Mayflower (Hotel). So she walked over to see the church. 00:45:29 She was stunned. The statue was gone. There was a basket of flowers up there. Very simple white basket and pretty flowers. The mosaic was still there and she wondered. A year later the National Science Foundation called her in so she was down. This overlapped Sunday so she went over to church. 00:45:53 While she was there she ran into a priest who was out on the steps welcoming the congregation. She asked him what happened to the statue. He said it was a tragedy. A few years ago, someone hid in the church after it was locked up and climbed up and knocked the statue to the ground and broke it into a million pieces on the marble flooring. 00:46:22 He said fortunately, the sculptor who did the original is still alive and they had taken up a subscription and they had just reached the amount of money they needed to have it re-done. It will be back in a few years. Reuder_02261986_Tape2_A [Reuder_Mary_by_Weidman_Bette_02261986_Pt3] 00:00:16 What were early influences, influences from childhood, family and place where she grew up. 00:00:44 Parents. They’re self-made people. Father went to St. Paul College of Law for a few courses but never really went to law school. He read law in another lawyer’s office and passed the state bar. He had a job in a title insurance company as well as private practice on side for a while. His movement upward at his company came in part because he was the only man who could take shorthand. The chairman of the board there was a real chauvinist. He didn’t want women at the board meeting, including secretaries. So the secretary of the company had to be someone who could tae shorthand. Her father was the only professional in the place. That’s what initially got him launched on the corporate ladder. 00:01:55 That story was told around the house and part of the moral was that all the skills you can get, the better off you are. You move up by seizing opportunities and also by doing your best at things even if they don’t seem very important at the time, such as taking minutes at a board meeting. 00:02:25 Her mother was a dynamo of an Irish woman. She flunked geometry in high school and had to go to summer school to finish. Got an A but flunked during the year. Finished high school in three years because she took extra credit and extra courses. 00:02:57 Mother was oldest of nine children. Not sure of family history but grandpa was sometimes a big fish in a little puddle and sometimes a little fish in a big puddle. They lived in Morris Minnesota for a while and at that time grandfather ran the general store in town. The general store in a small town is like running a bank. Her mother had an automobile of her own when she lived in a small town before she came to the city. 00:03:32 Not sure why they left Morris but they came to Minneapolis where her grandfather was deputy sheriff. He was deputy sheriff of Hennepin County for many years. He was also her godfather and she was the first grandchild. Whenever she wanted something and her parents said no because it was too expensive, she usually got it from her grandfather. 00:04:01 But never did he go to a store. He would have thrived in New York. He went to the pawn shops. That’s why when she wanted a musical instrument her parents thought was idiotic nonsense, her grandfather trotted off to the pawn shops and found a banjo or uke. 00:04:28 John Henry McGuire. He was married to Agnes O’Reilly McGuire. Her mother was Mary Agnes. That’s why she uses the ‘e’ in her name to differentiate. Because otherwise mail and things would get mixed up. 00:05:03 Bette’s name is Mary Eileen, her mother’s is Mary Agnes. Was oldest of siblings. Sister Winnie is about three years younger. She’s a dietician at University of California San Diego. 00:05:22 Her sister Margie just retired from teaching learning disabled children in the Minnesota school system on part-time basis. Before she was married, she was a full time teacher of French and English. She was a French English Drama major who went to Paris on a Fulbright after she graduated and taught English in a Paris high school. 00:06:00 Her sister Win went to St. Louis for a dietician’s internship and got her ADA. And then her brother came along, twelve years younger than Bette. A menopause baby and the only boy in the family so he was spoiled by all of them. Lee never really went on in education because it took him too long to mature and realize its importance. He almost didn’t finish college. 00:06:35 Everything was taken care of comfortably. He got married after college. Was ROTC throughout college so they went to Germany and he was a postal clerk for the Army there for about three or four years. He’s in the banking business in Minneapolis. He moved up very nicely. 00:07:02 He’s got an awfully nice manner and is a lot like his father. Her dad almost never said anything negative about anybody although those around him knew he could. 00:07:25 Her father was a republican so when it came to politics, they had very little in common. 00:07:43 She was her grandfather’s godchild, too. Grandparents did not give presents to all the numerous grandchildren. For her twelfth birthday she got a case of beer from her grandfather. A case of beer? for your twelfth birthday? He was always very proud of the fact that she enjoyed liquor. He was a good Irish cop. 00:08:18 He was always whipping out his bottle of old granddad. When she was a child, there was Prohibition. This was a disaster. Beer trucks used to come to the house from the brewery. They would have near beer but some of the cases of near beer were starred. The starred cases weren’t near beer. 00:08:48 She grew up being allowed unlimited near beer and liked the taste of it from about five years old. It was like soda pop and she liked it. By the time she was twelve, Prohibition had gone out and since she liked beer so much – her grandfather was out buying liquor to take to his lake house – and he picked up a case for her. 00:09:20 She wouldn’t let anybody else have it. Her birthday was in March and she got it over the summer at the lake and he told her it was for her birthday. People gasp and ask what kind of a family? But it was nice and she liked it. 00:09:50 You were the first one to go to college? 00:09:51 There was always stimulation. Among other things her dad used to go by a department store on his lunch hour and find tables with books. The got rid of schoolbooks, readers and sold them for a nickel or dime a book. He would pick up a carton full of readers and send them to his kids. A package from the store would come addressed to them and full of books. 00:10:40 She was a speed reader. Her family didn’t understand why she had books on her Christmas list when she read them in one day. Why didn’t she just get them at the library? She pointed out that some books you cherish and you want to read inside out and backwards. They couldn’t appreciate that. 00:11:05 The fact that these books came all the time led her to work with Scholastic books when her own children were growing up. She ran into problems because the teacher didn’t want checks but she would put in orders for the whole list. The teacher didn’t want a check for twenty-five bucks and she didn’t want the kid to carry twenty-five bucks to school. 00:11:34 She called Scholastic and asked if she could be a school. They agreed so they didn’t buy any more books at school. She bought them and had them address to the kids at home by the cartonful. They had zillions of paperbacks on every subject. She let the kids pick them and inventory them. They could read anything they wanted. 00:12:06 She had that idea because her dad did something similar when she was a kid. Her mother regretted that she didn’t go to college. Either senior year college or first year of grad school, her mother got permission to take courses at St. Thomas. 00:12:38 Her mother started taking courses in literature. Before that she had been member of great books clubs. Her father was a slow reader. Attorneys usually are. He would read every word four times to check its meaning. 00:13:00 It used to take forever. He couldn’t get over it. She read War and Peace in three nights. It was also motivated because it was due on Monday. And you read through the night. 00:13:24 Her mother kept reiterating that there’s nothing you can’t do if you’re willing to work hard enough. St. Catherine’s philosophy was that if God gave you the brains you had a moral obligation to society and to give back to society. How did you end up at St. Catherine’s? 00:13:49 Minneapolis was her home. She won a scholarship at Holy Angels Academy, a school for girls. She won a scholarship for a year while there and then lost it because she didn’t get straight As. But she did ace the ACT tests. 00:14:19 St. Catherine’s was giving out full four year scholarships to anyone who was a valedictorian of their school. She was shocked to find out about a week before school ended that she was valedictorian. Her father asked if she could get the scholarship to St. Catherine’s. She didn’t know. 00:14:47 She was walking through the school and the principal told her she wanted her to meet someone. She introduced her to the president of St. Catherine’s and said she was the scholarship student. 00:15:10 She was that naïve that she didn’t put those things together. She took a number of tests for scholarships in eighth grade and she flubbed a lot of them because of the questions but not because of lack of knowledge. She was always the youngest and the tiniest and the smallest in the class. 00:15:35 She started school when she was four and skipped a grade. As a consequence she was young and very immature. She’s serious when she tells people that she would have been a C student or flunked out of the kind of institutions Brown and these Ivy Leagues are if it were present day. 00:16:08 They weren’t the right schools for a student like her. She was lucky because she wanted to go to university and had had her fill of girls schools. She was the oldest grandchild. All her parents’ friends had girls as first children. The next oldest male was five years younger than she was. She lived in an all girls neighborhood. 00:16:37 She was tired of all girls, especially as an adolescent. She wanted to go to university in the worst way. Her father came home one day and told her he hoped he could afford to send her to St. Catherine’s. She didn’t want to go but then she won the scholarship and that was fatal. 00:16:57 When you went there, was it away from home? 00:16:59 She commuted to St. Paul. 00:17:10 Winning the scholarship determined where she was going to go to college. It worked out. There was nothing she could do about it. In those days you were not a free citizen until you were twenty-one and she lived in a sheltered, protected environment. 00:17:37 She remembers when her sister was allowed to get a job in a department store because she had never been allowed to. She didn’t ask. She just went and got it and nobody stopped her. 00:17:52 She thought she should have done something similar but that’s the way it goes. Was religious life important to your family? 00:18:02 They always went to church and their parents were adamant that they attend parochial schools but in retrospect they were probably no better or no worse than the local public schools. Has that continued to be important to you? 00:18:24 It’s important yes. Didn’t end up in Catholic University circuit the way it might have been predicted. 00:18:33 On the other hand, Annette was influential. She was a charter member of the American Catholic Psychological Association. It went through a number of phases. It was originally established to introduce secular psychology to Catholic schools and not make it separate. 00:19:15 The American Catholic Psychological Association also worked to make sure that the people that taught psychology in these Catholic institutions had PhDs in psychology and were not educators from other disciplines. 00:19:40 They were so effective. She remembers a trip to Boston where someone stood up and suggested all the Bishops be honorary members and someone stood up and said let them get their own PhDs. That organization met its objective so effectively that there was no more purpose for it. 00:20:09 Then they became psychologists interested in religious issues. Went after membership of a broader base of individuals who were concerned about religion as a variable with behavior. Then it became a division of the American Psychological Association. At the moment she is on the ballot but for president for that but doesn’t think she will get it because she doesn’t have enough graduate students but it’s nice to be thought of. 00:20:42 That was Sister Annette’s influence and the total background. Even though she doesn’t work in the field she is interested. She does go to church every Sunday. 00:21:02 They were taught at St. Catherine’s that there was no conflict between religion and science. They were even taught the theory of evolution. If you were going to believe in an omnipotent god, why couldn’t this god have developed a pattern of evolution as a form of creation? There’s nothing contradictory about it. Doesn’t say He did or didn’t. Doesn’t contradict anything. 00:21:35 It’s no great threat to the belief system. But she did meet anti-Catholic prejudice. 00:21:51 There was some at Queens. When she got her PhD she lost a couple of jobs because one of the professors was anti-Catholic. He had given her straight As in her courses. Another professor asked he did to her or her to him. He said not to use him for a reference. 00:22:18 When she was getting her degree, she had passed the written comps, done the thesis and passed the oral exams and he didn’t want to give her a degree because he didn’t think Catholics could be scientists. He was overruled by the rest of the faculty. 00:22:39 That was always latent. It was made definite at Brown where she was the first practicing Catholic who had ever come through their graduate school, that stayed in the church and in school. 00:22:04 She remembers at Queens that they were having a meeting on curriculum and the issue had to do with Latin as a subject. People were protesting that they should not accept or teach Latin because it gave an advantage to Catholic school graduates. 00:23:52 How far out can you get? Recalled that there was some oversight and they scheduled classes for Christmas Eve. She didn’t take it lightly as part of the General Studies faculty. She collected signatures on a petition based on religious discrimination. She overheard somebody say that they thought that she’d gotten over that years ago. 00:24:32 Keep your mouth shut and go about your business. 00:24:41 Weideman remembers period of assertion of anti-Catholic bias n the early ’60. 00:24:53 She knew all about it. There were three or four professors who had political connections with members of the board of higher education – one was his brother - who were in disciplines – at least one in Art – where PhD was not required but productivity of other kinds was demanded to greater degree if one didn’t have a PhD. 00:25:34 They got turned down for promotion. They decided that there must be another reason and it must be religious discrimination so they filed a lawsuit. Anyone who was known as a Catholic received a dossier on the vital statistics on these four people, all their credentials and so forth. She wasn’t impressed. 00:26:29 She called Tom Garvey who was active Dean of the Faculty at that time in between Theobald and Stoke. Garvey might have been acting President. There were about five department chairs who were Catholic. There was too low a number of Catholics in the science departments proportionate to the population. 00:27:35 The Catholic education had been anti-scientific not because it was against science but because it was cheap education. Science labs cost a lot of money. So if they had to short-change anything, it would be in the sciences. 00:27:57 So if you don’t have many chemistries, you don’t have chemistry classes. It’s simple. It was like trying to find quality PhD blacks these days. I’d hire ten tomorrow if I could find them. 00:28:13 This lawsuit came and they actually sued the college. City University didn’t exist yet. Whether they personally tried to sue Margaret (Riley) and Tom (Garvey) she doesn’t know. They tried to stir things up. 00:28:45 The Brooklyn Tablet, a reactionary rag, bought it all and was writing bigoted articles. She called Tom and asked if he wanted her to write a rebuttal to The Tablet. He said to ignore it. 00:29:12 They would take what she said and print it out of context so that she would sound worse than them. So she ignored it but was on receiving end of appeals etc. Mrs. Stoke said one of the major reasons Harold (Stoke) resigned after a minimum term was because he spent over fifty percent of his time as president either in court or going to and from court. He felt he couldn’t do anything constructive for the college. 00:29:57 It was awful. They made a settlement but the guys did not get the promotion. They talked about percentages. Bigotry came up across the board. Queens was 49% Jewish, 49% Catholic and 1% other. 00:30:28 All those protestant professors were in disproportionate numbers to the Jews and Catholics. They should have gone out and looked for Catholic professors. There were plenty of Jewish professors. The Jews have always advocated education and are willing to support and pay for it so the population has lots of professors compared to other populations. 00:31:05 Another group that will match the Jews is the Indians. They value education. 00:31:15 How could someone like you maintain a sense of the whole from a position on the School of General Studies? 00:31:42 She went to all the meetings and was on strategic committees. When she wanted curriculum changes she volunteered for curriculum meetings and chaired at crucial times. A curriculum committee is reluctant to vote down something its chairman wants. 00:32:09 It’s difficult for a department that doesn’t like to go to meetings to turn down what the chairman of the curriculum committee wants. She was also on the college curriculum committee. 00:32:33 Glen Howard asked him to attend the college curriculum meetings. When Glen left Jim Tobin took over and had her stay on. Jim left and Carl took over and Carl had her stay on. She was on the committee for years and that’s why she knows the history of so many programs. 00:32:57 They had to go through it – study abroad, foundation, support for Portuguese program. 00:33:07 This is your version of what your father did by being willing to do nitty gritty work. 00:33:18 It’s a means to an end. You weren’t thinking of gathering power, were you? What were you thinking? 00:33:31 She wanted to be able to have this program for the students. You had to grab power of some kind to get it through. No one was going to give it to her. They fought tooth and nail. She had to find a means and the means is usually control of the system. 00:34:02 Machiavelli. We read The Prince. 00:34:14 So you won your financial battles up until the financial crunch in the ‘70s? 00:34:24 She learned quickly that the School of General Studies had unused power. Back then all the undergraduates were minors and none of them had a vote. Their only political power was through their parents. The School of General Studies, 90% of its students had votes. She recognized this potential. 00:35:02 Glen sat back and was hands off and didn’t want to know. She ordered all classes into Remsen 105 many times and said it is against the law for her to try to persuade them to do anything. But she did tell them what was effecting their education, that the City Council was not coming through with money and that it would effect their evening courses. Someone needed to persuade them. 00:35:51 They were sensitive to votes and the students were all registered voters and if they weren’t they should be. A number of colleagues asked to speak to them and she would leave and say she didn’t know what they were going to say. 00:36:10 Then the students would go in there and get petitions and voter registration going and the City Council never knew what hit them. The kids would organize teams, sit on council meetings and speak. The fought and one time they were there until two in the morning testifying. 00:36:36 Right up to the Murphys’. Their budget was always the first to be attacked. 00:36:53 Jim Tobin called and said he didn’t know what she was doing but to call off the dogs. Another time Alan Margolis called from Registrar and said they got a call that asked if 8,000 petitions from the police department is enough. 00:37:28 She marshaled the borough of Queens there. 00:37:39 At the end they had about 2000 enrollees and 300 majors. It was a big operation, especially when they had the two-year and the four-year programs. At one point there were fifty-six sections of psychology 1. That’s a lot of students. 00:38:05 They tried to keep it to thirty students to a section. They did creep up. 00:38:23 She had various titles but they left her alone to run it. At the end she thinks she was an assistant chairman. Originally, they invented different titles to protect her role running it because the department chairman was really in charge. But Gregory told her it was her baby and to do what she wanted. So she did. 00:38:44 When Schoenfeld came along as chairman, he didn’t like that. He tried to get her fired. But Jim Tobin was her dean then and Jim wasn’t about to let anyone go. It was being viewed as a role model on how to build the rest of the school. 00:39:07 Then Rubin Bergreen in music saw what she had done and was busy building the music department to the same level. At the end, you (Weidman) came along and joined with the English department. You get those three departments going and you get a strong movement. 00:39:35 But you had a real battle on your hands? 00:39:44 The day session and faculty were seriously threatened all along. They didn’t like that their decision on night session lines was not final and that Dean Tobin’s was. They couldn’t hand-pick faculty. 00:40:12 She could hand-pick. They didn’t like that she had the power to select a faculty of forty to fifty people and determine pay scale and assign duties and all the rest. 00:40:30 Toward the end, a couple of times, the School of General Studies people were so numerous and they were so divided that they almost got her elected chairman of the department. Their perception was that she would be intolerant of any other program in the department. 00:40:53 They could never understand – up until she was elected chairman – that you can give your all to something without giving your soul to it. You can giver her something to work on and she will fight for it. 00:41:17 Move her to somewhere else and she will fight for that. It isn’t your sole perspective in life. If you have to fight so hard and so vehemently and so consistently, this perspective comes up. This has been one of her handicaps at Queens. 00:41:35 When she was elected chairman, it was only because opposition was wanted less. Since she had been in SGS for five years now, maybe it would be alright. 00:42:05 It was her baby. She had to take care of it. 00:42:17 For at least ten years, she realized that that program was viewed as Mary Reuder’s department and not a psychology department at night. She had a lot of people because she asked the dean for appointments to people who would be willing to be trained and take it over and lead it further. 00:42:45 She pointed out that when that happened, she would take a sabbatical and move back to the day session to allow the person to work freely. She didn’t want to just up and leave because she had seen the lousy administration that came in when you elected any Tom, Dick or Harry – no matter how nice – to be chairman with no training, no nothing. 00:43:19 So your effectiveness made the program seem like it belonged to you? 00:43:31 The other thing is they never believed that she was trying to train someone because couldn’t understand that she would give it up. Part of problem. Hard to find someone willing to do it. 00:44:07 A similar thing happened with the major. She took over from Greg and began offering courses. They didn’t have anybody to teach them. The kids were majoring in Reuder instead of psych. Then she asked for more people because she didn’t want the students majoring in one professor as she had experienced in undergrad. 00:44:39 What was your big contribution to the Psychology Department at Queens. 00:44:58 There were two. One was building the School of General Studies so it became a national model. She used to get telephone calls asking what the policies were and how she did it. During the 1970s she had an interview for a vice president for the equivalent school at Temple. 00:45:38 One of the things that had them interested was that they knew her work. They wanted her to have the job and come back and interview. Over the weekend, the vice president who had her hand-picked was fired and that was the end of that. 00:46:09 The other achievement was the year as chair of the whole department. Within one year she got a shared proposal for development of an undergraduate lab. She got a shaping of the undergraduate experimental requirement through and she got a new masters program through the college. [Reuder_Mary_by_Weidman_Bette_02261986_Pt4.wav] 00:00:40 Mary notes that as a psychologist you have the opportunities to learn about problem-solving, thinking, and discipline. Other fields such as geology won’t get these opportunities to problem solve. But, they have their own opportunities. 00:01:32 She says when students are a freshly graduate from college, they don’t know how to use their resources wisely. 00:02:47 Mary talked about one guy that she talked to. He told her there’s a scholarship for historians. Most faculty members never knew this existed. 00:03:56 She says there are people who won’t profit no matter what you do for them. They just don’t want to work. You have to face their reality. 00:04:45 Mary says you can’t predict human behavior. They can change at any time. 00:10:10 Mary talks about the project that involved the blind students. It was located in Pennsylvania. A blind student came up to her and asked her if she could take her psychology class for credit. Mary welcomed her. She got tools to braille parts of the human brain so the blind student could learn. 00:13:10 She talks about her general ideas of research in psychology. Her research brings together the physical with the psychological functions. Mary talks about her thesis. She says why she took certain classes and why she took courses in medical school. 00:17:00 Mary talks about how she taught her psychology class and what techniques she used to teach. 00:19:27 They had no lab and no equipment. 00:21:20 Mary had her students do research of their own instead of giving them step by step questions. 00:24:30 She notes that her research really requires her to have a lab because it was necessary to explain the data. 00:28:30 Departments didn’t have enough funds to afford the materials needed. 00:37:30 Mary talks about universities that want to be first class but they are lacking in resources and support. 00:38:09 Mary notes that it’s very unsatisfying experience and that she doesn’t miss teaching at all. She wasn’t given the equipment that students needed participate and enjoy the class. Instead she had to do it all herself. “Why bother anymore? They don’t care.” There was no reward at all. 00:40:05 She talks about how the shape of her career up to this point conforms to her earlier expectations and how it differs. Mary notes that much of it was reacting to events. She wanted to get a college degree and get a job. She wanted to teach from the beginning. That’s what she loved. 00:45:00 If she wanted to start again, she would get a degree in academic administration. ",

  "Ries_Helen_timecode.txt": "Helen Ries was born to parents of Gottscheer ethnicity who emigrated from present day Slovenia. In this interview, Helen discusses her Gottscheer heritage as well as her life during the Great Depression, World War II and the postwar era. Following graduation from high school, she worked as a stenographer before marrying her husband in 1946. Although she grew up in Ridgewood, Helen has also lived in Forest Hills and Glendale, where her children grew up. She has a son, born in 1949 and a daughter, born in 1952. Eventually, she moved back to Ridgewood, where she became an active member of the Ridgewood Historical Society. She has given numerous presentations in the historic Onderdonk House on how life was like in Ridgewood during the early 20th century. 00:00:51: Grew up on Green Avenue and Cypress, near borderline of Brooklyn. Went to school in P.S. 81 and Grover Cleveland High School. 00:01:47: Parents emigrated from Europe and brought their first house (a six family house) during the Depression time. People moved in and out/snuck into houses without paying rents. They could not maintain the house without tenants. They sold the house and bought an eight family house on Woodbine Street, at a net financial loss. 00:03:07: Grew up during the 1930s; children were mostly unaware of the Depression. 00:03:22: Parents were born in modern Slovenia (originally part of Austria-Hungary and then part of Yugoslavia). Their families were farmers in Europe. People (of Gottscheer heritage) were displaced after World War 2. Many from the area of Yugoslavia escaped to Austria and then immigrated to the United States. 00:04:15: Parents spoke Gottscheerish. Recorded an interview with her mother in which she (Helen) asked questions in English and her mother responded in Gottscheerish. 00:04:50: She would often respond in English to her parents� Gottscheerish. 00:05:31: Ridgewood was German and Gottscheer. Neighborhood had a German butcher, etc. 00:06:33: People came to the United States for more opportunities. Father was one of 12 children in a farming family. People followed their relatives to the United States. 00:07:17: To immigrate to the United States, you needed a sponsor, a job, and an apartment ready. Her parents were able to help their relatives emigrate from Europe following World War 2. 00:08:30: Had ration books for food and clothing during war time. Resources went to the military. 00:10:04: Overall, she really enjoyed her childhood. Helen notes that life was probably a lot more difficult for adults than for children, who were mostly unaware of Depression era challenges. She often played games (one game called �Horse Range�) and went to the movies. Cinema often had live entertainment and film. She would also go to ice cream parlor after the movies. 00:11:33: There were a lot of theatres in Ridgewood. 00:12:50: Helen lived in the house on Woodbine Street for a few years and then moved away following her marriage. Parents stayed on Woodbine Street 8 family house for a while before moving to another house (the house where Helen currently lives). 00:13:47: Parents had two daughters. Most people did not have too many children because they could not afford it. 00:14:39: Started work as a stenographer in a private insurance company. 00:16:04: When kids were in high school, she was offered a tiny little job at an accounting firm. As she was promoted, this small job became a big job. When husband became sick, she quit. Overall though, she really enjoyed her job. 00:17:40: Remembered cobblestone streets and peddlers with horse drawn wagons. Milk was brought in a box to the stoops of homes. 00:19:25: Homes had an icebox. Iceman would deliver ice into a dumbwaiter. 00:20:54: Milk and vegetables all came from local farms. Circus would come to an open field area on DeKalb Ave and Cypress Ave. They would bring animals (elephants and camels) down Cypress Ave. 00:21:53: Did some work at the Onderdonk House (built in 1709). Told children visiting the Onderdonk House how neighborhood appeared in the past. Ridgewood was mostly farmland before it became industrialized. Before Helen�s time, people could see farms with animals across the street. 00:24:20: Newtown Creek was an important waterway that allowed Ridgewood farmers in the 1700s-1800s to transport their milk/vegetables to Manhattan. Pollution from industrial activity and sewage has thoroughly contaminated the creek. Cleanup efforts are underway. 00:26:12: Manufacturing activity near area of the Onderdonk house: Welbilt Stoves and Hallmark Cards had factories in the area. 00:27:08 Greater Ridgewood Society started as an imitative to save Onderdonk house from city development. People collected money to pay back taxes for the Onderdonk house. Historical Society basically bought the Onderdonk House. 00:27:40: Disastrous fire (1975) burned almost the entire house; only the frame was left intact. Community had to raise money to rebuild the house. House was built exactly the way it was before the fire. 00:28:33: Onderdonk families were originally farmers. In 1900s, farmlands were disappearing from Ridgewood. Economy of neighborhood around Onderdonk progressively became more manufacturing based. 00:31:40: Remembers assisting a lady during the Depression era. Garment factories that produced sweaters had finishing portions (leftover fabric material that the machine could not handle). Helen, along with other children, assisted the lady in collecting these finishing portions. Lady would then prepare the finishing portions and sell her work back to the factory to make an income. 00:32:41: Father worked in milk factory and then was a trolley operator. 00:34:17: Had some relatives who immigrated to the United States in 1912. The current house where Helen currently lives was built in 1923, the same year that her parents were married. 00:36:40: Gottscheer Hall hosts several events, including the Miss. Gottschee pageant. Helen was a Miss. Gottschee briefly at age 19. 00:38:10: Acquainted with 5 people who were killed during World War II. 00:38:30: Husband was also a Gottscheer living in Ridgewood. They met each other before the war. Then, her future husband fought in the war. He was injured on the day the war ended in Europe 00:40:06: On V-J day (end of the war in the Pacific), her future husband made a surprise visit in military uniform to her office. They were engaged and married on September 21, 1946 at the Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal church. 00:41:47: Son was born on December 31, 1949 and daughter was born 3 years later on Lincoln�s birthday. 00:42:58: Husband got a job at the A and P supermarket (located on Woodbine and St. Nicholas Ave); it is probably a chicken place now. He also started delis at supermarkets (had 5-6 delis under his administration). Then, he died of lung cancer in 1969. 00:44:27: There used to be nice stores selling quality merchandise on Myrtle Ave. However, the neighborhood is changing. 00:46:08: Houses are aging. Many of them are undergoing much needed maintenance (e.g. redoing the mortar). 00:47:00: Moved to Forest Hills to take care of her elderly mother. (She and her husband bought a house in Forest Hills from her mother after the last tenant left). They moved to Glendale after Forest Hills. Lived in Glendale for 25 years. She currently enjoys the convenience of Ridgewood; subway and bus lines are very accessible. 00:48:41: Children grew up in Glendale. Son lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Daughter lives in the area but travels for business frequently. 00:49:43: Many of her friends and cousins have died. She is currently 88 years old. She still has a good friend, Ruth, who is also the same age. 00:52:00: Went to a roller skating rink that used to be in Queens Center Mall. As a teenager, Helen also frequently visited Coney Island and Manhattan. 00:54:00: During wartime, trolley tracks were torn to provide steel for the war effort. 00:56:33: Trolleys were easily stranded because of weather conditions such as heavy snow. A snowbound trolley would have to wait for a second trolley to arrive and brush off the snow. 01:00:00: Helen�s mother used to buy live chickens at the chicken market. The chicken market disappeared by the time Helen got married. There are chickens housed at the Onderdonk house now. She feels that it is important for children today to visit the Onderdonk House, see the chickens and have an overall awareness of Ridgewood�s farming heritage. Many children no longer receive any type of exposure to agriculture. 01:02:43: People did their own baking. There was no freezer or refrigerator. There was only an icebox. During the winter, there were no ice deliveries and the box had to be kept outside. 01:04:02: Icebox had to be periodically cleaned (Whenever the ice melted, the water had to be emptied). 01:05:25: Streets used to have gas lights. There used to a lot of gas lines that ran through houses. Gas was used to fuel chandelier lights in houses. ",
  "Riganese_Michele_timecode.txt": "“I always focus on my [own] feelings, but I find the stuff that’s really simple and raw is what people really connect with.” If it wasn’t for Chili, her little Pomeranian, singer-songwriter Michele Riganese may have never moved to Sunnyside. Chili came with a certificate for three free visits to a vet in Sunnyside, and while Michele first thought, “Where the heck is this place?” she quickly fell in love with it. She moved from Gramercy Park to a “gorgeous apartment” in Sunnyside eight years ago. Here she found the sense of community her old neighborhood lacked. “You can rely on your neighbors for this cup of sugar,” she says. Besides the new apartment came with “a fantastic hallway, really bouncy with sound that feeds inspiration for me.” Michele’s music is inspired by current events, her own relationships and those of others. A performer since she was seven, she likes to create heartfelt, melancholy songs infused with hope. “I always focus on my [own] feelings,” she says, “but I find the stuff that’s really simple and raw is what people really connect with. I don’t worry too much about being global or universal.” Michele’s career as a child actress took her to Broadway and Off-Broadway shows. It wasn’t until college that she found her real passion and decided to dedicate herself exclusively to music. To her, making money is secondary. She volunteers with Musicians on Call, a nonprofit who sends musicians to care facilities, and intends to donate half of the money she makes through her crowd-funding project at Rockethub to BARC, an animal shelter in Williamsburg. Michele supports her career as a singer/songwriter by doing voice-overs and writing songs for weddings; she doesn’t want a nine-to-five job. “Unless it is something that feeds my soul, it’s tearing me away from music, which is my gift and the very reason why I am here,” she says. Michele has live performances scheduled at the LIC Bar on August 30, 2010 and at the Sidewalk Café in Manhattan on September 5, 2010. In the podcast Michele talks about what is involved in being a singer/songwriter. ",
  "Rivera_Melissa_timecode.txt": "A little bit through grade school and a bit during high school I lived over on 25th Road, with 21st Street. I had a lot of friends who went to Our Lady of Mount Carmel grammar school, so I always hung out in that area. Everything in that area seems new. I miss the houses though. Over here on 37th Street going towards 31st Avenue, round the corner from Associated Supermarket, you used to have these gorgeous Victorian houses, with like the wrap around porches. They�re all gone. There are four story apartment buildings in their place. Astoria is still very family-oriented but there is something about the old families. Round here was very Greek and Italian. So you had all the grandmas wearing black, who were widows, wearing black�I�m an old soul so I think that�s what it is, I just like the old stuff. My mum was born in the city. Where Lincoln Center is now, there used to be a big housing complex. My mom was born there. My grandmother and my Dad and all of my Dad�s side of the family came from Puerto Rico, so my mom�s like first generation and I�m second generation. Once my grandma got displaced from over there, they moved to Queensbridge. So mom spent the rest of her childhood in Queensbridge. Even that whole area has changed too. Overall, the change is good. And the nice thing is that it has always been family oriented. Unfortunately as my son is now six, I never took advantage of all the new mommy and me programs that have come into the area � that�s really all just happened in the last four years. I started getting into organic living and things in 2003. I got into essential oils and aromatherapy, and it kind of just took off from there. You learn about that and you learn that you can put it in your products�and you realize ah, you can make your own products, though it took me a while to actually start soap making - I was terrified. I could read all the books�but I needed someone to show me how to do it. I took a class finally and realized �that�s how you do it� � a class with Ursula Basch, who runs a school called Herbal Bear. She has a beautiful school up in the Catskills area but also teaches in her small Manhattan apartment. I�ve worked since I was 13, starting in the stores along Steinway. Like the movie theater which is now New York Sports Club and Duane Reade, that used to be a movie theatre, the really old View way Astoria. Actually I was working there illegally at first because I was thirteen, and you can only get your working papers at 14. I always worked full time, went to school full time. I still work now. I work in child welfare so I do foster care-related work. I still have to do that to pay the bills! Soap does well but it will really take a while before I can make this my fulltime gig. I used to work directly with the foster kids; you know helping them get housing, employment, college, that stuff. Now I�m on the teaching end, so I train the staff who work with the kids; it�s really about teaching them how to like teenagers! Teaching them how to work with teenagers, and it�s funny because I�m thinking I don�t really like teenagers any more. He [my son] is going to go away to college, I hope, he�s going to do everything that I didn�t have a chance to do. So really I do the soap making at night, you know. He�s a good kid, and he goes to bed early, around 8 o�clock. So then I�m mixing and stuff. Originally this was his bedroom (soap making room). And then this room used to be my room and I converted it into his bedroom. I figured I needed to create some space so I could make products. It�s hard if you keep your stuff for it in one room and do your mixing and cooking in another room. So I figured its part of growth and part of what you do, to make it happen. So now I just sleep wherever I fall asleep, either on the sofa, or with my son. There are days when I just want me-time, I don�t want to do this�but then the reality is I love it. And it really helps that he�s a good kid, I don�t need to worry about him getting into things. It�s also good that my mom lives upstairs, so when he�s getting restless I can just send him upstairs for a bit, you know. But pretty much during the day at work I�ll go online at lunchtime and work on some recipes, so I�ll do some of my soap-business stuff at work. Then at home when he�s asleep I start mixing and everything. I use five main ingredients: Olive oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, shea butter and cocoa butter. That�s pretty much it. I actually think I might change it though to eliminate the cocoa butter, because partly because it�s getting a bit expensive and I don�t want to raise my prices. I think just like a baker, you always want to experiment with new stuff. So for two years now I�ve kept the same recipe and now I feel like I can move on. All of my colorants are spices and botanicals. The aromas are all essential-oil based and stuff. Sometimes it can limit you when you try to keep everything natural but I don�t want to be one of those soapers (soap makers) who make 150 different bars of soap. I like the small, quality control piece. At the moment it�s pretty much my friends who buy them, and sometimes my colleagues; also, people who follow me on Twitter and Facebook. I also do wholesale to a woman out in Long Island, actually in Shelter Island, a whole food store � apparently all the people in Shelter Island love my stuff. I do want to grow it. But I�m very clear that I don�t want a retail location. My dream is to have a nice little spot in Long Island City or Astoria right by the water (I like water � even if it�s just a big window facing the water I�d be happy.), where I can just produce my stuff. I could hire some local people. And I�d really like to have some kind of internship program for young people, so that at least over the summer they can learn how to make soap, and also about business � you know, shipping, and packaging, calling clients, all that stuff. I think there is a growing interest in green living etc. in Astoria. But a couple of the events I�ve done � maybe because it was a year or two ago � sometimes people see it and understand it, but may not want to purchase it. They think wow, five dollars for a bar of soap? You know. But recently I haven�t done any of the local events in the past year. I know that Astoria Market has things going on� Brooklyn it�s definitely taken off. They�re huge on the indy-craft-fair kind of stuff. In Astoria we�re still kind of getting there. Astoria Events was the best one, and now Astoria Market. And I saw Agora LIC or something like that. But in some ways it�s still untouched. The process of making soap is pretty cool. When you�re mixing the lie and the oils together and then you just see it all come together. I used parsley powder to make the soap green. It�s like making a cake. Then you scoop it out and put it in the mold. It�s like �perfect�! My mom got laid off a year ago. But she�s a crafter � she makes wall pieces and quilt pieces and things � I�ve been starting her off on selling some things. Since she was 16 she was knitting, crocheting, sewing�and that�s not me. There used to be a bridal store on Steinway. That was fun, being a junior and senior in high school and working in a bridal shop, seeing all the brides coming in for their fitting. And thinking \"Oh - that�s the dress I want for my wedding\". Of course, when I got married I wore nothing that I thought I would end up wearing. And the movie theater was fun. I don�t remember actually watching the movies because I was always the one making the popcorn or selling the tickets. But I�m not a movie person anyway. I also worked at New York and Company when it used to be [�]. And a couple of supermarkets, you know typical high school stuff. Then I discovered working in the city in retail and making more money, and never worked in Astoria shops again! I worked in the city from that point on. In 1997 when I graduated from college I did the usual send out 100 resumes, hope and pray somebody calls you. Somebody did, and I had no idea what was involved � I interviewed and got hired and was like ok, social worker to a girls� group home. But it worked; I found my passion really quick. Now and then I miss working with the kids. But I�m well aware that I�m not as young as I used to be � I�ll be 39 in a couple of months. I like the piece I�m doing now anyway which is getting information to workers � I�m more like a resource person. That�s in Manhattan. Technically I work for the state on contract but I�m based out of the School of Social Work for Hunter CUNY. It�s a job, and paying the rent and the bills. And my boss is a real big supporter of my business, which is great � she�s like if you need to run some errands in the morning, don�t worry about it, just let me know. But I don�t take advantage of that. My herbs I get them all from Oregon. Only because Mountain Rose herbs has the best quality. Their stuff is so fresh. Even though I did discover there�s an herb farm in upstate New York that I�m going to visit in a couple of weekends. If that works for me, then that just might be my more local resource for herbs and stuff. My oils, I was getting them from a company in Ohio, because that�s where most of the suppliers are, but I�m going to switch to a company in Boston. I really try to get everything in New York, as closely as possible. Luckily there�s a great supplier of lye up there (the old-fashioned draino � used saponify the water). And the packaging I try to get it within New York. But it�s interesting because there are not as many suppliers on the East Coast as on the West Coast or the Midwest. That forces me to really work hard to find local suppliers, and then once I find them, I stick to them. As a matter of fact I have a friend who�s a carpenter and was recently unemployed. I commissioned him to make me a soap drying rack � just like in every profession you become obsessed with the equipment, having the best etc. I was looking at some but they were so expensive. And then he did this for me in a couple of weeks. When he delivered him yesterday I wanted to hug him, I was so happy, so elated. He couldn�t really understand it but I was like �no, trust me�, this is a soap makers� dream. The way you feel about the Yankees is the way I feel about this. It takes about 4-6 weeks for the soap to dry anyway, a place where you can aerate them. This has 14 shelves and they fit about 12 soaps each. And it�s on wheels so I can move it if I need to. Before - I put the soaps around the apartment, using cookie racks and things. But then it�s like you move them around the place. I just wanted one space. I have a bunch of soap-making friends in California, in South Carolina, in Ohio. It�s a great industry. People are so willing and open to share, to critique your stuff. There�s not really any envy � it�s all about supporting and helping each other. There�s a handful in New York � but there are still so many in NY that don�t know of each other. I manage a Yahoo group of soap makers � but I only let people who have their own business to join, otherwise they just want to steal our stuff to set up their businesses. Typically it�s all women. I can think of maybe five guys. They tend to be the chemistry people, who really understand the chemistry of soap making. So I read their books and try to understand because it�s important to know as much about the business as you can. And they make the equipment. And they are typically married to somebody in the group! I totally want to stay in Astoria. There�s a part of me that�s an upstate girl, I�ve fallen in love with [�.] � part of me would love to have my own garden there and stuff, but there�s still a big piece of me that�s like I can�t say I make it in Astoria. And I really think it�s possible to get a warehouse space, there�s so much in long Island City and here. You don�t really need a huge space. But something enough where I can be comfortable, produce, have a staff room, things like that. And just get my stuff out there. And have the opportunity for people to come in and take tours etc. It�s also very artsy down there. At La Guardia Community College they�re doing great stuff supporting local artists and stuff. My son is called Juan. When I get orders he�ll come in and say you need some organization, he likes to organize. ",
  "Robishaw_Sandra_timecode.txt": "“The wonderful thing about Sunnyside is that we are all here together and that it hasn’t made the transformation yet to Bed, Bath and Beyond.” Sandra Robishaw likes to get to know her neighbors. An activist, painter, hobby photographer and census enumerator, she has always been drawn to the fringes in Sunnyside: Think Indian goat milk soap, hand-painted signs of beauty salons, cemeteries, illegal immigrants and littered sidewalks along railroad tracks. Sitting by her mysteriously tail-less cat, Sandra explains that she isn’t drawn to things that are beautiful in the traditional sense. Instead, she attempts to illustrate an object’s quirkiness and ambiguity, giving glimpses of its owner’s unique personality. “The wonderful thing about Sunnyside is that we are all here together,” Sandra says, “and that it hasn’t made the transformation yet to Bed, Bath and Beyond.” Sometimes the owners of Sunnyside’s Mexican, Turkish, Romanian and Lebanese delis are reluctant to let her photograph the displays inside of their stores, but being “a nutty little lady” she quickly wins them over. “I had storeowners take my photos and rearrange things, so they look better. People are ready to interact,” says Sandra, whose goal it is to one day be able to say “hello” and “thank you” in every language spoken in the neighborhood. Her ability to get people to interact came in handy when she took a job as a Sunnyside census taker. Going from house to house to count those who didn’t respond to the initial mailings, she sat down with illegal immigrants who confided their fear of the Department of Homeland Security. Sandra patiently explained to them the long history of American census-taking and the need to provide the Census Bureau with headcounts in order to secure ESL programs and quality education for their children. “I think you can relate it to them on a level they [understand], especially if they have kids,” she says. Like the storeowners, the immigrants gave in to Sandra’s entreaties. Sandra moved to New York in the early 1980s after receiving a graduate degree in art from the University of Colorado. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Sandra met her husband on the N platform in Astoria, and that the couple decided to buy a home in Sunnyside that was once a socialist meeting place. (The house on 49th Street appeared “on the crest of thinking,” she says.) In the podcast Sandra talks about her interactions with Sunnyside storeowners. ",
  "Robles_Frederico_timecode.txt": "“I have some customers who have snacks ready for me.” When Federico “Fred” Robles knocks on our door we know it’s that time again—time for the monthly ConEd meter reading. Fred’s route stretches along 47th Street between Queens Boulevard and 39th Avenue and includes more than 700 meters. While he chose to work for ConEd because of the possibilities it offered for advancement, his job has several other perks. Touring 21 different Queens neighborhoods each month, he is exposed to foreign cultures and gets a peek at people’s basements. Fred says hasn’t learned any new languages on our block, but does learn some Polish here and there by asking his Ridgewood customers, “How do you say in Polish, ‘I’m here to read the light’?” On his routes Fred sometimes encounters angry people who blame him for their high utility bills. But, he says, “You really can’t take it to heart. You don’t know what they are going through. And you’ve got to remember: you are the face of the company.” For the most part, though, Fred, who lives with his wife and 15-month-old son in Throgs Neck in the Bronx, likes to interact with his customers. If they were sick the month before, he inquires about their wellbeing, and some customers look forward to his visit in return. “I have customers who mark it on their calendars and say to me ‘I’m happy to see you this month,’ “ he says. “I have some customers who have snacks ready for me: Cookies in a bag.” Fred’s feet often hurt and his eight-hour workday can be taxing, particularly when it is freezing or raining. Yet he plans to continue his Sunnyside route for another two years before trying to get a managerial position. I suggest we try to keep Fred for as long as possible. Teach him some of our languages—Chinese, German, Spanish, Irish and Hindi, for example—and please have some cookies ready when he knocks on your door! In the podcast, Fred talks about what he sees, hears and smells in people’s basements and, of course, about cookies. ",

  "Rohling_Tony_timecode.txt": "“The solution is to clean up graffiti as soon as it appears” Researching methods to create a graffiti-free Sunnyside, Tony Rohling and the members of his court association in Sunnyside Gardens came across a successful Australian model.“The solution for graffiti isn’t putting a police car on every corner 24/7,” Tony explains. “The solution is to clean up graffiti as soon as it appears. Once the vandals realize that their work isn’t tolerated in this community, they won’t do it anymore.” The group’s first collaborative graffiti clean-up event eight years ago was an instant success. More than 40 people showed up, cleaning far more than the anticipated two blocks on Skillman Avenue.The nonprofit organization HYPERLINK \"http://sunnysideunited.com/\" Sunnyside United was born and began collaborating with the local police department, businesses, religious organizations, government officials, merchants and the mayor’s anti-graffiti taskforce. Today Sunnyside United welcomes between 75 and 100 volunteers to each of their biannual clean-up events, in which 40 neighborhood blocks are cleaned. “But the follow-up work is just as important,” says Tony. That’s why he recruits residents and merchants to maintain lampposts, store gates and walls, providing them with brushes, paint and chemicals, and visits local schools to educate students. The next clean-up event is on May 15, 2010 at 10:00 AM. Volunteers will meet in front of the Sunnyside Reformed Church on Skillman Avenue and 48th Street. In the podcast, Tony talks about society’s mixed message regarding graffiti, his clean-up methods, the Australian model his group reproduced and the many ways to get involved. ",
  "Roman_Eva_timecode.txt": "Eva Roman was born and raised in Colombia. She immigrated to the United States in November 30th of 2007 with her mother. She has been living in Kew Gardens ever since she immigrated to New York. She came to New York in hopes to learn English and continue her education in Mechanical Engineering. In this interview, Eva describes her success in life as an immigrant and provides important tips for future immigrants. 00:00:48 Eva says her full name is Eva Caroline Barros Castro. She’s from Colombia. She immigrated to the United States in November 30th of 2007 with her mother and her dog. Eva mentions that one of the reasons for her immigrating to the United States was that when she was twenty-one, her grandmother claimed Eva’s mother and Eva could come with her family. Another reason was to finish college and learn English. 00:02:05 * Eva describes the history of her life. She was born and raised in Columbia. Eva was in her second year of college when she immigrated to New York. Adapting was an easy process for Eva because she was of young age when she immigrated to New York. One of the more shocking things to her was the weather . She found adjusting to the weather as difficult. The city Eva is originally from is known to have nice warm weather. Another difficult part for Eva’s transition was to live in a small space with her family members. She first lived in a small apartment with her grandmother and her aunt. She wasn’t used to not having her own space. Eva and her mother started to work in the hopes of finding a better place to live. She has been living in Kew Gardens ever since she immigrated to New York. In the beginning, Eva resided in an apartment with her mother, grandmother, and her aunt. Then, Eva and her mother moved next door to her grandmother’s apartment. Afterwards, her marriage led her to move one block away from her former apartment. Eva has lived in the same neighborhood and the same block for the last ten years. 00:05:27 Eva portrays a timelines of her moves around the neighborhood. She arrived in New York on November of 2007.

Eva currently resides in her new residence for the past five months. 00:06:35* Eva’s mother comes from a large family which consists of eleven siblings. She notes that she’s not close with her father’s side of the family. Eva’s mother has six siblings living in New York and the rest of her siblings are in Colombia. Eva says that her family is much larger in New York. In Colombia, Eva would only see her family during the holiday because of the distance. However, in New York Eva’s family is much closer and would see each other more frequently because they all live in Kew Gardens. Eva’s relatives have been living in New York for thirty years. 00:09:05 Eva says that she wasn’t alone when she first moved to New York. She compares herself to most immigrants and states how they come alone to this country and they feel miserable. However, it was completely opposite for Eva. 00:11:31* Eva describes the positives of living in Kew Gardens. She notes that Kew Gardens didn’t change much for the last ten years. She likes that Kew Gardens is a diverse neighborhoods The blocks in Kew Gardens are divided into groups of different cultures and ethnicities. People from Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador lived in one block. The rest of the neighborhood consists of mostly of immigrants of European descent. In one block she’d find the Dominican Daily and in another she’d find a European newspaper. A little further inside Kew Gardens there reside immigrants from India. She explains that she’d see European cheese and Indian spices which were new to her. Eva claims that Kew Gardens is a quiet, safe, and peaceful neighborhood. Transportation is also very accessible. Long Island Rail Road, subways, and buses are close to her. She voices her love for Kew Gardens for being the perfect neighborhood for her. 00:15:10 Eva states that she enrolled in Hunter College as an ESL (English as a second language) student. She studied there for eight months. Then she applied to CUNY to continue her studies in Engineering, which took time because she had to transfer her credits from Colombia. In addition to college, Eva was also working in an Italian bakery. After her credits were transferred she started attending New York City Tech in Brooklyn. She continues studying Mechanical Engineering. Once she graduated from City Tech, she went to Farmingdale State College and quit her job at the bakery. She found another job at Farmingdale in which she was an administrative assistant. It was a roofing company. Once she graduated from Farmingdale State College, she quit her job and found a new job in Long Island that is related to her engineering studies. 00:19:30 As an immigrant, Eva says that it was a long journey for her to be successful. She had to work hard to learn English at the college level. She also had to work hard to pay off her tuition. 00:22:20 Eva expresses that commuting from Kew Gardens to Farmingdale was challenging for her. She didn’t have a car and taking the LIRR was expensive. 00:23:40 She describes that her hard work and efforts led her to have a successful and happy life. 00:24:25 Eva suggests that everyone has an opportunity in America but it only comes from hard work. 00:27:00 Eva explains to the new immigrants to keep working hard and never give up. In the end, it will all equate to success. “My advice is not to give up, just keep going.” 00:27:55 Eva describes the changes in infrastructure of the New York City. Currently, she works in construction. This allows her to see the city’s progress. ",

Sergio attended high school for a year and a half where he learned the basics of English. 00:16:00- Sergio felt that the instructors and other students in his English as a Secondary Language class looked down on him and the other immigrants.

He expresses that he wishes to reconnect with the friends he made while in school. 00:21:00- Sergio is fearful that his children will not be able to identify themselves as Peruvian and that his children will become alienated from their heritage. He constantly reminds his children about the life’s hardships. One hardship he reminds them of was his early struggles in Peru and his hard journey to New York. 00:25:40- First job was that of a messenger by foot and or bicycle.

Sergio says his brother not only told him how to do things but also taught him how to get things done. 00:28:30- Sergio speaks about the tribulations that his brother experienced, such as not getting paid for work that he did because he was undocumented. Often time people Luis worked for would threaten him about his status. Sergio says that his brother and his experiences taught him how to get jobs that would pay him and not abuse their power as employer. 00:31:51:- Begins the second part of the interview on March 17, 2017. Sergio explains his relationship with his coworkers and how they were all from different nationalities. He benefited from these friendships because they would correct his English whenever he said things incorrectly. 00:36:15- Sergio talks about his divorce and how it was a big moment in his life. He felt like he was losing his children but in reflection he says it was one of the best things that happened in his life. He states that it was one of the three best things that happened to him. First were his children, second his divorce, and third was his practice of Buddhism. 00:41:20- Sergio speaks about his first encounter with a Buddhist woman. He then speaks about his conversion and how he became a Buddhist. He feels that his connection with Buddhism occurred at a moment in his life when he needed spirituality. 00:43:25- Sergio continues to speak about his experiences as a newly converted Buddhist. He says that the Buddhist woman that he met (Kathy) said “If you want to be happy this is the religion for you and it will make you happy.” His first meeting with Buddhists was an informal gathering where they came and discussed their problems and troubles. He realized these people weren’t discussing their problems simply for pity. This method of communicating was a revelation to him because they were opening their hearts and stating ‘this is what I am going to change.’ 00:46:10: Sergio is asked what he believes is a good friendship. Sergio explains how a true friendship is based on what actions that friends make in sincerity. Friends should act without asking for something in return. A real friendship is someone who truly cares and would not hesitate to tell you the truth when you’re doing something wrong or harmful. 00:48:00- 00:58:00- Sergio gives an example of young people displaying bad behavior at a Chinese restaurant. He cites this example as how people should reflect on their actions wherever they go. 01:05:30- Sergio talks about his fear and hardships he faced while being an illegal immigrant in New York City. He states that having his brother here made the transition to a new country far easier than most that come here illegally. Sergio says that “If you know you are coming here, you know it will be difficult. It is not Peru, and things are different here.” 01:14:00- Sergio talks about the influence of Catholicism in his life how it relates to his life in Queens. He speaks with Walter about the meaning behind certain Catholicism beliefs. Sergio breaks his language down and says that “religion should exist for the good of man not the other way around”. This leads to an overall discussion of religion and its influence on people. 01:23:30- Sergio and Walter discuss the pending hardship that Latinos face when they are faced with unemployment, alcoholism, or drug abuse; specifically within the illegal immigrant community. Sergio discusses how we used to drink when he was younger. He feels he needs to communicate to the youth in Queens the dangers of excessive drinking. 01:33:00- Sergio and Walter discuss the present day perspective on illegal immigrants (specifically because of Trump’s presidential election.) Why do people view illegal immigrants so poorly and as criminals or thieves? Sergio speaks about it being part of the generational characteristics of illegals and part ignorance from those who are “threatened” by illegals. He feels that proper parenting will negate these types of views. 01:40:25- Sergio discusses the relevance of politicians and the relationship of people who work all day without being able to stay home and take care of their children. Sergio states that politicians only think about themselves and their ability to be re-elected. There are only a few that are sincere. 01:42:00- Walter and Sergio discuss the new immigrants that do not want to learn English or rather they do not make the effort to learn English. Sergio feels that if you want to better your life, you need to study and go to school. He says that the youth today are only concerned with making money quickly. 01:45:20- Walter asked about how he would feel about a Latin President. He says that the president that does that would be only interested in himself like most politicians. He feels that the only president that was closest to the Latinos was Bill Clinton. 01:46:00- Sergio talks about Donald Trump as President and compares him to a dictator. Sergio explains how he is only acting in his best interests. He goes on to explain that if we keep hoping that one person will change the situation from bad to good then we will always be waiting for change to happen. We cannot put our fate in the hands of one person. 01:50:00- Sergio states how humanity needs to change within itself to create a clearer and brighter future for the world. He compares this to a person and its shadow because if you change your position your shadow changes. 01:54:30- Walter asked if someone who is new to the group and religion of Buddhism, how would there transition look like? Sergio cannot answer for anyone but how he felt when he became part of the group. He states that he felt a certain vibration and decided to practice Buddhism in order to be happier and to change the negative parts of his life. 01:57:30- Sergio says that suffering allows us to open our eyes and become stronger. Identifying that suffering and making the change to right that wrong will ultimately lead to happiness. He states that he wishes to go back to Peru with his philosophy. 2:01:00: Sergio explains that happiness is relative. He says that people living in the third world that do not have anything still have a smile on their face. Happiness is not a material thing; it is a spiritual and mental thing. If it weren’t for suffering than there would not be true happiness. PAGE \\* MERGEFORMAT 4 ",

The rest of the family moved to the United States in 76, after being represented by his father. Mr. Roque did not know one bit of English when he came to America. Therefore, everything felt strange to him. His first memory of Queens was that he wanted to see his father since he did not see him for a couple of years. However, the interaction with his father was strange for him as well; due to the communication gap. At a young age, he was really curious about Filipino people and their culture because of feeling homesick. While he was aware that there were Filipinos in his neighborhood and school; he did not know how to approach them and assimilate into the culture. It was during his high school years, that he began to connect with Filipino people and embrace their culture.

He hung out with the Spanish people when he was younger so he picked up a lot of the music and djing skills. *00:25:35 Wanted to be a Met (Music Electronic Tech) when he graduated from High School because he loved computers and music. He would do binary and was a hacker as well, during his high school years. 00:26:36 His main hobby, as a child was playing video games. He wanted the Atari video game, but his father said “ no” because they had no money for it. So, he would go to his friends, Jays house to play video games. Jay was also Pilipino and a programmer; he learned how to create video games by reading a book called “ Compute”. He became interested in computers by watching Jay create video games and ended up learning binary and becoming a hacker in the 80’s. 00:31:33 his father was an accountant and his mother was a bookkeeper. Therefore, his choice of career is completely left field, because his parents wanted him to be a bookkeeper or something related to accounting. However, he was interested in music, because he liked the Raggae mixed tape his father gave him when he was eight or nine years old. His father got the tape from a friend of his. He listened to the mixed tape and liked what he was listening to. *00:34:17 the computer part was during his high school days. He wanted a job that combined music and computer together.

A guy gaveRolado a VSH tape and asked to watch it in 1991 or 1992. The video was Dmc Battle, which was a world competition ; it had a kid named Cubert in it and he is from the west coast. He was in Germany, playing at the “ Ministry of Sounds”, a really big and famous club in Germany. Rhodello was impressed with what Cubert did in 6 minutes and he was also amazed by the fact Cubert was Pilipino as well. *00:37:55 he was interested in free style music. The first free style record he ever picked up was called “Scars of Love” by TKA and “ Silent Morning”. He also followed a Filipino artist named “ GIA”. However, he did not have a turn table so he worked at McDonald from 86 to 89 in main street, Jamaica just so he could buy one. *00:39:40 bought his first turn table after working a year in McDonalds. Back then, everything was about layaway so he would keep twenty five dollar for himself from his pay check and the rest would go to the lay away. Therefore, it took him a year to get two turn tables and a mixer. 00:40:29 High school in the 80’s, was like prison and people had to belong to a certain group. For example, the in group or the nerd group. Therefore, even though he was a mischievous kid, he would hang out in the library a lot because he would be bullied. It was there, that he noticed the Greek and Italian kids and other groups of people in the library; including a DJ group, so he would share his mix tape with them. They would ask him, if he was a DJ and he would say “ no” because he was still learning it. *00:41:54 He got into DJ, just by listening to mixed tapes *00:42:12 Was also inspired by a kid called “ Large Professor”, who is part of Main Source. He made Rhodello listen to “Live at the BBQ” or maybe “Faking the Funk”. However, Rhodello had no idea who Large Professor was at that time or that he would blow up to be a big name because he was more interested in free style music rather than hip hop at that time. *00:43:30 Started mobil djaing and was part of a Spanish crew called “ The Rhythm Project” ( TRP ) around 88 or 89, it was like a house freestyle thing. The group would make money by playing at Spanish parties. he would do that, work at McDonalds and go to school. In high school he was part of a program called, co-op where he would work one week and go to school another week. 00:44:57 told his father that he wanted to be a music electronic tech and fooled his father, by saying that it involves computers. 00:45:17 Worked as a banker when he was in college because of being part of the co-op program. First he worked in the bank full time and then he worked there part time; while the music was a side thing. However, he started the career change in the late 90’s and was mostly hanging out with Pilipino people from the early 90 to 95. The group did parties in places like: FIt, St. Johns, and Hunter college. It was also during that time, he was getting into the Pilipino culture; like how they would act or dress. Community was a big thing and huge in the 90. 00:47:30 the scene in the 90’s was all about gangsters. He moved from Spanish and Black friends on to hanging out with the Asians – Filipinos and Chinese kids. Therefore, it was a cultural shock to him. He was part of a crew called 1-6-9 and they would hang out in 169 street. They would always look out for each other and make sure that the Lost Boys wouldn’t attack them. The crews would really feel like family, like if you didn’t have a house or somewhere to live they would help you out. The 1-6-9 crew in Jamaica is not what it used to be. 00:49:15 some of the other hubs; where Filipino people would meet are: all the restaurants in Roosevelt – Epiny, Philippine Village. Also, there used to be a club across the street from Perlin; that’s where a lot of Filipinos would hang. Filipino crews really started emerging in the 90s and a lot of them would DJ. 00:50:38 Was part of a DJ group called “ IBP” ( Intro Base Production ); It was a pure fobbed out Pilipino crew. However, there were also other cool crews. For example, Hit Squad; they were a huge group. Lowell was a big figure and a major DJ. He was doing a lot of things, that Rhodello was doing. Another crew was called “ Quar Tribe”; they were also a huge Pilipino crew as well; and they happened to be in Rosedale. The whole DJ community would be together. A lot of the Filipino parties would be held in Ukrainian Hall in Aster place between 10 or 11; where the Stomp theater (126 Second Avenue New York ) is located. The Quar tribe was the first crew to rent the place out and he saw it. The next day, his crew rented out Ukraine hall and had their own Pilipino people be there. They would all meet at a pool house called “ Mammoth Billiard’s” around Fashion Institute ( FIT ). A bunch of Pilipino would go down there and there would be fights there as well because of the rivalries between Jersey and Queens and New York people. Each of the crew had a DJ section; where everybody would hang out. Q tribe and IBP were connected and they created the biggest crew ever, but they had no name for it. It was either IBp and Quar Tribe or Rolly ro and Cleo Derek. Clo Dereck and he, would rent out Village Gate and would throw a party; where hundreds of Pilipino people would come to party. The major thing in the 90, was about community and Filipino parting. 00:56:02 it was when he started battling that he started noticing that there was something bigger. He started a battle crew called, “ The Fifth Platoon”. He created this crew with Daddy Dog and Neal Armstrong, who DJ’s for JC and is the ambassador for Adidas sneakers. This group also had his ex-girlfriend Cotton Candy, Candice Studio, Emerge, Dough Boy, and Vin Rock; who was from Jersey. They were the first battle group in New York City and that was what got there name out there because they were doing something different. They wanted to have something different and wanted Filipinos to be part of the Hip-Hop culture. His girlfriend at that time, Cotton Candy, started to get into the DJing thing and started to learn how to beat juggle and scratch. She put herself out in California in 96 or 97. She performed during the ITF, which was a big event, without telling anybody and started scratching and cutting. They also got involved with Asian Avenue in the late 90’s. They spread the words about Pilipino culture and promoted their networks. *01:02:08 the major highlights of his career consisted of: buying his first record in 86, buying his first set in 89, DJing from 90 to 95, and dmxing from 93 to 94. 01:04:40 Battling against DJ Baboo was a memorable battle for him. The battle between them was for beat juggling and DJ Baboo took him out by a simple trick mixing. The battle was at the “ Palace Of Fine Arts”, in San Francisco. 01:11:44 He stays in Queens because he wants to spread the culture more and he loves being a person from Queens, New York. he was born in the Philippines, but he was raised in Woodside, brought up more in Corona, and currently lives in Elmhurst. 01:14:45 believes the life and culture are different in Queens now, from then what it used to be. For example, he thinks that Queens is fast paced in today’s time and it is not as social as it used to be. 01:18:04 The first Filipino crew he has ever heard was called “Boom Base” in around 89 or 90’s. It was a really good crew and his cousins were part of it. FOR THEM, it WAS ALL ABOUT HAVING A LARGE system. The next crew was called “Hit Squad” and they were also all about having a large system. His crew was called “IBP”. They on the other hand, were all about partying and did not care about having a large system, do different types of parties (after school parties). 01:22:52 IBP, were the first ones to go as DJ’s in the Filipino Independence Day Parade. They rented a truck and a generator as a float. After the parade, they rented a table for $500 and would duplicate and sell mixtapes. They would sell the tapes for 10 dollars and made over a grand. A year later, they were stopped and soon they were unable to get a sound permit. The group wanted to stop violence and wanted everyone to know that hip-hop was a universal thing. The rented out a spot one last time during the Pilipino Independence Parade and were part of Asian Avenue at that time. They flew Kai down in the early 2000 for the event. Kai was hanging out with them and signing autographs; People wanted Kai to perform, but they told them no because they were not allowed to have a system. However, the committee of the parade found that Kai was at the event, so they asked Kai directly to perform. Kai declined their offer because they would not let Asian Avenue do a system. Candice felt good by what they said, but she also felt bad because she was thinking about the community. After some discussion, Kai ended up performing and they promoted Asian Avenue. 01:29:51 worked at Fat Buda, in order to find himself again; where he met Christina, who wanted him to teach her how to be a DJ. He decided to teach her; after searching her on social media and talking to her again, in Fat Buda. Unfortunately, a couple days later, he was told by the doctors that he can not work because his leg was going to be placed in a metal cast. Christina found out about his situation and crated a “ Go Fund Me” account. Therefore, he hopes to give back to the community and wants to help DJ’s that has worked for 15 to 20 years at least; because they gave their entire life through the night life.

  "Rudnytsky_Dorian_timecode.txt": "00:01:36 they lived at a farm 00:02:11 Toms River was an isolated area, with mostly chicken farms 00:02:29 next to them was a wooded track, where a woman lived named Lenny whose brother was in World War I, and always welcomed him into her house 00:03:37 around the corner of their house was what the New Jersey pinelanks is now 00:04:57 they farm shut down when he was around 12 00:06:51 him and his mom was near the fence, which was near a wooden track, and all of sudden a pack of 7-10 dogs who were terrier size to a germen shepherd size , and jumped at the fence. 00:07:33 the state police also set traps to rid those dogs, and traps were set on their woods too. they came to check on the traps every once in a while . Once they came heavily armed with shot guns, due to the fact that they encountered fairly large dog. They didn’t shot any of the dogs but they did catch one. 00:08:45 both his parents were musicians, his father was a pianist, generally a musicologist, mostly through the Ukrainian community, not American. He eventually did start a music concert kind of a thing, which continued for 18 years and he would have many different kinds of people come and play, including people who became very successful, and famous musicians. His mother was an opera singer. 00:09:44 both his parents were really well known in their country (Ukraine). Who had to come to the United States due to the World War II. Their career as a musician in the Ukrainian community went to an end. Finding themselves in NYC with a baby and another soon to come they were confused on what to do next. 00:10:33 a friend who was also a musician suggested on buying a chicken farm, in New Jersey. His father didn’t know much about farming, but his mother knew a bit more, so they eventually made it. 00:12:45 they still managed to stabilize their Ukrainian culture despite living in the United States. Such as the style of their house, the pillow cases the tapestries, and Ukraine was his first language, the company his parents kept was in the Ukrainian community. His brother was a contraposed, who had a really good reputation in the Ukrainian community, before the American. 00:14:09 the idea of class was very strong in their house but not in the American way. 1. Nobility 2.peasentry 3.intellectual class. They spoke of themselves as the intellectual class, though his father kind of thought of himself as nobility, and his thought of herself as in the peasant class. Despite all of this throughout the years he still felt isolated due to the fact his peers didn’t have the have philosophical outlook. 00:15:40 during his mid teen years he came to realize that this social life was so away from home and that his friends were just uncomfortable. Especially near his father, who was really demanding of proper kind of behavior, which wasn’t common in that area. 00:16:57 he started to feel like he didn’t belong in any group. That’s when he started to gravitate towards the arts people, and went towards the musicians. 00:17:35 He and his brother was taught music by his father, they started learning piano at the age of 5-6. by the time he was twelve, his family started a music school. This lasted for about 15 years. At the age of nine they started to learn string instruments. His brother chooses the violin, and he did the cello. 00:18:20 Maria Helgur taught him cello who was famous in another place at another era, near Austria Germany, who also came here due to world war II. They were 3 sisters Maria, Greta, and Elsa. Elsa made a very successful musical career here and United States, who was the first female cellist. The other two sisters moved to a chicken farm in Fredon new jersey, and taught privately, at Wednesdays Maria went to his house and taught all the other instruments ,while his father taught piano, and his mother taught voice. 00:21:16 he decide piano wasn’t quiet his thing so he concentrated on cello. And cello, wasn’t really looked at as a big thing. So that left him feeling isolated. He also became a runner, played basketball and a few other sports. 00:22:26 his father sent them both to the best teachers he could find. Throughout his time in high school he realized that he didn’t make that good of a musician, because he lacked technique, and in the other hand his brother was quite good at it. His brother started doing concerts in high school and winning them and eventually got accepted to Julliard. His parents weren’t that supportive of him being something else. In his senior year when he took the Julliard entrance exam, he wasn’t accepted. He ended up going to Rodgers University, due to its variety of courses and it being cheap, and the second reason being his cousin went there. 00:30:00 he started playing base in a rock band in high school. They were the first electric band in that area the called themselves “the invictous”. He loved it, he found was much different then classical music, unlike classical music this wasn’t as structural and rigid, and he didn’t have to strive for perfection every second. 00:34:00 de was debating whether he should do a French major or geology or music. His cello teacher “Arnold” was never able to find his level, but in his second year he realized he was losing interest in psychology, physiology, sociology, and he started paying more attention to his cello. 00:36:02 he got involved with the ROTC, which he joined at the beginning and a requirement which he found out later, was that you have to pass every semester for the first two years, and failing would lead to restarting the course. He started thinking about transferring. So he went to his last teacher for Julliard. Where he was told to play, she gave him a standard cellist study book at a higher level, and told him to play “popper number nine.” This was very high register stuff. Though he tried his best he did awful. At the end of it she asked him “why do you want to be a cellist, why don’t you be a plumber?” and he walked out of there very upset. 00:41:46 one of his teachers invited him to a summer convention, where he saw Maris Isenberg play, who was a cellist, who left him at awe. He lived in Millburn New Jersey. The following spring he decided he wanted to study with Maris. So they went to Millburn, and he started taking classes with him. For the fall semester he decided to go to Mannes school, which was 3rd in rank of music schools. In the summer he attended a summer camp, when he got a letter from Maris Isenberg, that he got accepted to the Julliard facility, and this time he got accepted to Julliard. 00:48:15 coming out of Rodgers, Julliard felt really different, everyone was so focused on their music and the academic expectations were very low. He was in the BS program for which required 60 credits. Meeting the academic expectation wasn’t a challenge at all. Being in Julliard he felt like just another ordinary fish in the pond, he didn’t really feel that enthusiastic about practicing all day. Eventually he decided to get involved with the student government. His brother was in the student council and he joined as a volunteer. He noted that the student body in Rodgers was really different, getting elected into the student council held a lot of significance in people’s eyes, but in Julliard there was barely any involvement in the student council. He decided to take advantage of that fact, and that fall he took a shot at running for the student body president, and he got elected. 00:54:20 there was a Julliard dance when jazz musicians should jam, and he decided to change that and have rock and roll music instead. So he heard Michael Kaman had a band which consisted of a few Julliard students, and a few outsiders. He auditioned them and they were petty terrible but he still hired them. 00:57:08 The following summer he went back to toms river to find the” the invictous” broke apart due to a fight, so he decided to make another band named “there are no trumpets,” and they turned out to be the best band around again, as fall came they fall part ways. 00:59:54 after returning to Julliard he called Michael Kaman and said that he had equipment and that he wanted to play with them if they wanted, and at some time at October their base player wasn’t available so he was called to play, but at the night of the dance the base player was there, that night one of the girls bought her boyfriend who was a producer the band the Muchoius which had a hit song called “the sluppy” , who suggested that Michael Marty(the drummer) and he should start a band without the rest of the members, and he suggested to get the two guitar player from his previous band, and that’s what happened. 01:01:30 at the next Julliard dance they all got together and they played, and at the end of the day Marty said the he knew someone named Bruce Turgison who was an engineer at Atlantic records. And that he was a part of a band named “the lord of the ring,” who did an audition through Bruce. At that time they were told to back when they had more stuff. So Marty called Bruce and told him about his new band and he arranged an appointment for them at the night time. So they went and auditioned 01:04:01 their tape was taken to Armored Raegan who signed their band the following. They changed their band name to “New York rock and roll ensemble.” They got a recording contract with the Atlantic records, starting from the beginning of December. Eventually Bruce and Adrian (another young engineer) became their managers. 01:11:15 they played at the Rockefeller’s daughter’s wedding, and many other places like that, and involvement in crowds like that got their names on magazines, etc. 01:15:58 they did a movie in Mexico called Zakary, they toured, etc, but they barely made any money. The band lasted till 1973 then the band broke off. 01:17:00 once the band started he dropped out of Julliard, which disturbed their parents. He knew he had no future as a cellist, no matter how much he tried he couldn’t get it right, so he dropped out 01:18:54 he met the woman he married at that time and had his first child. Eventually he went back to Julliard to finish of that last year. 01:20:18 they did many concerts that were on the television, they did several concerts with Chicago symphony, Boston orchestra, etc. His parents always tried to listen to the music more carefully to see if they were missing something, and searched for some meaning in the music, but never found anything significant to it, they just thought of it as bizarre. 01:23:46 on his second year of unemployment he decided to get involved with production, but nothing came out of it due to the birth of his second child. 01:25:08 by 1975 he decided to put together his own project and came up with a band called “falcon.” Who played at the beckon theater twice, but by the end of 1976 that died off. After that he jumped into a local band for a year, and that was the end of his band carrier. 01:26:45 he started working at the airport terminal, supervising a gift shop. Their financial situation was pretty bad. His wife sent a frustration letter to blemish who waste wife of Marty who was now a television music writer. He said to come over and that they’ll get him a job. And he had to start practicing the cello after 10 years, and started playing again for 3 years. Which lead to him slipping back into rock and roll. He met the drum player from “invictous” again who was an engineer. Through him and a fluke he made an EP, which got nowhere, due to circumstances. And that was his last musical event in his life. ",

Monsignor Edward A. Ryan St. Gregory the Great Church Mary Gibbs: My name is Mary Gibbs from the St. John’s Oral History Project and I am interviewing Monsignor Edward Ryan, Administrator of St. Gregory the Great Church on the church premises located at 242-20 88th Street, Bellerose, New York. Msgr. Ryan: 88thAvenue. Mary Gibbs: 88th Avenue. Thank you, Father. Today is Saturday March 22, 2014. Msgr. Ryan, I thank you for interviewing with me today and I appreciate it very much. Msgr. Ryan: I am happy to participate. Mary Gibbs: I would like to begin by asking you about your family background. Msgr. Ryan: Alright. As I mentioned when you came in, I’m Queens born and bred and have lived in Queens all my life. My father was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but moved to Hunter’s Point in Long Island City in 1908, just before the Queensboro Bridge opened. From there the family moved to Forest Hills in 1926, and my mother was born in Richmond Hill and came into the Ryan Family home in 1941, after my father’s mother died, and I was born in that house on Clyde Street and, ah, grew up there, so I’m a part of a long line of Queens residents. My father used to entertain me about growing up in Long Island City, and because of our proximity to the railroad in Forest Hills I always had an interest in trains. Mary Gibbs: I, I noticed that you are an avid railway person…(laugh). Msgr. Ryan: You can see from the report here. Mary Gibbs: Yes, I noticed, and can you tell me the names of your grandparents? Msgr. Ryan: Yes. My father’s, my father’s parents were Dennis and Sarah Ryan. They were both from County Tipperary in Ireland. My mother was Eva, short for Evangeline and William Trotter, and they had a more distant heritage in Ireland, in Canada, and in Germany. At least on my mother’s side it was a bit mixed up. The Trotter’s were from England. Mary Gibbs: And their employment? Msgr. Ryan: Well, my father for all these years was an insurance investigator. He worked for an insurance company called Retail Credit that is now known as Equifax. It is really a credit rating agency. But Dad spent his time interviewing people associated with people who had applied for life insurance policies. So he would get out and around Queens County. He’d spend the first half of his day at least in the field, as he said, interviewing people. Then he would come back to his office in Jamaica and write up, ah… Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: …the reports. So he had a very vast and deep knowledge of Queens County and its inhabitants, and he regaled us with stories in the evening, of some of people he had encountered in his travels. Mary Gibbs: Yes, and that was around which area? Msgr. Ryan: Well, he was all over Queens County. As an investigator, he had stories that he brought from really all around. When I was ordained a priest and assigned to St. Elizabeth’s Parish in Woodhaven, he said to me, “Oh, you’re going to a good parish.” And then, he asked about the butcher, and he asked about the banker. And he knew all of these people in the neighborhood and he had stories about all of them. Mary Gibbs: And your Mom? Msgr. Ryan: Mom was a, a home maker until my brother and I reached high school age then she went to work for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. And she worked with them for a good number of years. And again, that brought her into contact with all sorts of interesting people. Mary Gibbs: Oh yes, and your grandparents? Msgr. Ryan: Well, my father’s father, Dennis, when he came to this country, when he came to New York City, he worked as a motorman on the Third Avenue El. He, at one point had his handle taken away from him because he had, had a minor collision with a, with a train ahead of him. I had assumed that what he had done was too, what they had called a key through a signal, where a motorman can use his signal indicator to force the tripper to go down so that he can move through slowly past the signal. But, I found out in later years that the Third Avenue El, until it was torn down in 1953, had no signals at all on its local tracks and everything was operated by sight which was an amazing thing. Mary Gibbs: Wow. Msgr. Ryan: But then after that he went to the city, he went to work for the city water department, and Grandma Ryan was a homemaker. She died rather young of a heart condition. On the other side of the family, the Trotters were interesting because they worked in metallurgy and, and chemicals, and my father’s, my mother’s father actually, I think was an engineer of sorts. But he died back in 1933 so there was a good deal of distance from his death to my birth and my mother’s mother, of course was a homemaker. Mary Gibbs: Did your grandpa take you to his job? Msgr. Ryan: Well, my father’s, father died when I was six months old so the only grandparents that I remember was my grandmother’s mother, and she passed away when I was seven so the contact with the grandparents was minimal. My father’s bachelor brother lived with us in the house at Forest Hills. It’s not an unusual arrangement. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: In those days and I can remember when I was quite small he would walk me up, to the other side of the Austin Boulevard then up the hill. There was a pedestrian bridge there is still, at 67th Avenue across the mainline of the Long Island Rail Road, and I would be endlessly fascinated watching the trains go underneath and waving to the engineers. Mary Gibbs: And that was in what year? Msgr. Ryan: Oh, that would have been in the early 1950s… Mary Gibbs: Oh… Msgr. Ryan: Late forty, the early 1950s. And, likewise, my father, on Saturday’s used to drive me over to Morris Park and pull the car up on Atlantic Avenue alongside the lay-up yards where the locomotives were held over the weekend for the commuter traffic to start again. And they were steam locomotives because that was used then. Mary Gibbs: Oh, yes. And you attended school in Queens. Msgr. Ryan: In Forest Hills. I graduated from Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, a grammar school, along with Msgr. McGuirl. We were class mates and graduated together in 1959. We had the advantage that when we were in the 5th grade and the 7th grade, we were in the front of the building on the second floor, I could see across Austin Street to the main line of the Long Island Rail Road. So we had diversions during the day watching the trains, and I think, though I may be mistaken, that the very last steam-drawn train was in operation, at least part of our semester of 5th grade. It came in with the Oyster Bay train in the morning, and then, steam operations ceased that year, and everything was turned over to diesel. Mary Gibbs: And that was in, around 19… Msgr. Ryan: That was around 1955, or, ‘56 I believe. Mary Gibbs: Oh, and it was owned by who? Msgr. Ryan: Oh, the Long Island Rail Road? Mary Gibbs: Oh, that was the Long Island last steam… Msgr. Ryan: Last steam train that they ran. Mary Gibbs: Okay. Wow. Msgr. Ryan: There was a big ceremony called, one day in the fall, Saturday, called “Farewell to Steam” and they ran a steam-drawn train out to Hicksville. I think they had troops of Boy Scouts aboard and it was sort of a bid deal, and they got to Hicksville, everybody transferred to a west-bound train that was pulled by a brand spanking new diesel locomotive, and from then on steam engines did not run on the Long Island Rail Road and revenue service any longer. It was the end of steam. Mary Gibbs: Wow, so that is history in the making. Msgr. Ryan: What I do remember, when I was about, I would think, two or three years old standing on the platform at the Forest Hills Station, and in those days the only big department store in Queens was Gertz’s on Jamaica, and if you didn’t go there then you had to go into Brooklyn to A&S, so you went into Manhattan to the department stores. But my father, in those years worked on Union Hall Street, so, we would, take the train at Forest Hills east and get off at Union Hall Street, stop in at Dad’s office and, go to Gertz’s. I do remember standing on the platform one day waiting for the local to pull in, and there was an eastbound train coming roaring down number two track, the express track, pulled by a steam locomotive, and it was a wonder of sound and fury and action going past. Mary Gibbs: And clouds of smoke? Msgr. Ryan: Clouds of smoke and I ‘course, I had no idea where it was going, but, ah, there was so much steam action in those days on the railroad because electrification was limited on the Long Island Rail Road. They were electrified only as far east as, ah, Hicksville, I think, they had gotten to Hicksville on the main line and, and so if you were going up to Oyster Bay, or, you were going out anyway east of Hicksville, or, the southern division anywhere east of Babylon, you rode behind steam, and so the steam trains were plenty, plus, the freight was all, and there was a good deal of freight movement on the Long Island Rail Road in those days. Mary Gibbs: So, so it was both commuters and freight? Msgr. Ryan: And freight, yes. Mary Gibbs: Oh, interesting. And so you went to school in, at Catholic schools. Msgr. Ryan: Catholic school there, and then when I graduated I went down to what was called Cathedral College in Brooklyn. It was a six-year program and when I completed that, I went out to the major seminary at Huntington for another six years to prepare for priesthood. Mary Gibbs: Now, what were your experience(s) like growing up in Queens, and going to school in the neighborhood, apart from the regular… Msgr. Ryan: Oh, it was wonderful. Mary Gibbs: You know, sports and everything. Msgr. Ryan: Queens was a wonderful place to grow up. It was still undergoing development in the early 1950s so that in Forest Hills there was still a lot of open spaces and that made it fine for doing all sorts of sports, and we had a lot of freedom when we were growing up. Adults just didn’t have the hands on supervision 24/7 that they have today. Mary Gibbs: Freedom meant what? Msgr. Ryan: Freedom meant, you came home, you changed your clothes, you did your homework, and then you did… And in the summer when you were on vacation, you had your records and you went out. Mary Gibbs: Out where? (laugh) Msgr. Ryan: Out anywhere. You went out to make up your day’s entertainment, and then we would go out and bicycle ride and play ball. We would roller skate, ah, we would as we got older, explore because if you had a bicycle the world was there. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: And parents, ah, it was a different world, that parents just said, “Where’re you going, we’re not going out, be back in time for dinner,” and you came back. We had no cell phones, um, we learnt to be self-reliant because if we got into a jam you had to know how to get yourself… Mary Gibbs: Of course. Msgr. Ryan: …out of a jam, and we learnt pretty much how to do that, and amazingly we did not get into too many jams. But when Msgr. McGuire and I were in late grammar school, in the summer, we’d get on the bikes and because we were trained a bus, ah, we would ride over to the 88th Street Gray crossing and Glendale which was manned and we would stop, and the crossing guard there would be in his shanty and we talked with him until the bell rang and then we would come out and manually lower the gates. And there was a lot of traffic on the Lower Montauk because they, they, ah, the Long Island moved equipment between Long Island City and Jamaica had a lot of freight. So there would always be something going on, or if we got bored with that then we would bicycle out, in on Metropolitan until we got to the end at Myrtle Avenue L, and that was like campus. It was the cemetery and a few old stores and fields. So we would park our bikes by the fence and, when the old gate cars came, in, they had, some of the sides were open, and when they got to the terminus at Metropolitan Avenue, the conductors would go through and switch the backs of the seats so they’d be facing towards Brooklyn for the trip back to… Mary Gibbs: Ooh. Msgr. Ryan: …back into Brooklyn, and we thought that was endlessly entertaining. Mary Gibbs: Exciting. Msgr. Ryan: Well, if it rained, we’d take ourselves to the main branch of the Queens Library which was on Parsons Boulevard those days, and we would go up to the Long Island room, and do our research on old history looking at old photographs and things. And it was a wonderful… Mary Gibbs: So, where was that? Msgr. Ryan: It was on Parson’s, not far from Presentation Church. It later became, to be used by the Family Courts, and I don’t know who has it now. The library built a brand new main building there on Jamaica somewhere back in, I think it was in the late 1960s on Merrick Boulevard, but they were on Parsons and the Long Island collection was up in the attic. It was wonderful, and you would go up there and say to the librarian, you know, “Show us everything you have about Forest Hills,” and you go rummaging through the old photographs, and things, ah, or, we played games, or we listened to music, because then the girls had an old wind-up comptroller in the attic, and piles of the 78 rpm records, so we played all the old Irish, that was John McCormack and Chauncey Olcott, and all that. Or, you know we went to the movies, or if you could scrape together a, a quarter, went to the ice cream parlor. Mary Gibbs: Sounds pretty, pretty… Msgr. Ryan: You did all that. We had a lot of fun Mary Gibbs: Yes, I could see that. Now, in what year was that, with you and Msgr. McGuire? Msgr. Ryan: What year that we… Mary Gibbs: You did grammar school, and all those exciting activities. Msgr. Ryan: Grammar school? Yes, well, he came in at third grade. His had lived our Lady of Mercy Parish and as a youngster went to P.S. 144 for two years. Then his parents brought him over and enrolled him in Our Lady Queen of Martyrs because Our Lady of Mercy in those days did not have a school. So he came in and as faith would have it he got plopped at, it was a rare occasion, but there was an empty desk. He got plopped next, alongside me and that was the fall of 1953 so we became pals, and that has endured now for fifty…what, sixty-nine, sixty-nine… Mary Gibbs: So what did you talk about with the Long Island person? Msgr. Ryan: Well, there was not much that we talked about, except that we just watched the trains and we talked about…What did we talk about? I don’t remember what we talked about in those days. I think it was just watching the trains, you know. Mary Gibbs: (Laugh) And he would operate the key, what is that? Msgr. Ryan: Well, Oh, that was my grandfather when he was running the train. Mary Gibbs: Oh, it was your grandfather. Msgr. Ryan: That was my grandfather when he was running the train. He would (inaudible) the signal. That was what a motorman did, and they still do at this side, I think. Mary Gibbs: I see. Msgr. Ryan: They don’t actually use the key. I think they just sort of inch forward on the triple… (inaudible). Mary Gibbs: (Laugh) So who was your role model? In school, in the community. Msgr. Ryan: Well, you know, we were fortunate to both have good families, and so, you know, our dads. There was a young priest who came to Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, just, before we met each other and we were sort of pals with him, Father Michael Conroy. Ah, and then there were a couple of youth leaders. There was a thing called the Olqm Club at school, which was really an after school program back in the 1950s that had all sorts of, you could do arts and craft, get help with homework, or you played, sort of indoor sports, or we went on trips, or ah… Then, of course, we had a lot of fun when we were altar boys ‘cause we went on outings to, there was the Rye Beach boat trip in June and during Easter Week we’d go to Palisade’s Park if it is still open, and Christmas, we’d go singing at the St. George’s Hotel, and there was a big party. So there was a lot of activity around the church and different activities there. The church was very much the center of social life. Mary Gibbs: So, did this young priest, and all the social life impact you, and had an influence on you to become a priest? Msgr. Ryan: Well, yes, I think it did because I early on, I became an altar boy and I was fascinated with all of that. In those days it required a bit of training because you had to memorize what seemed like endless amount of Latin, which sounded like, to us like jabberwocky, but you memorized it. And then there was a whole mystique about it, and think it was in those years that I really began to think about being a priest. Mary Gibbs: Seriously. Msgr. Ryan: Seriously, yes. Mary Gibbs: You were ordained in 1971? Msgr. Ryan: ’71. Mary Gibbs: And, ah, you fulfilled your duties in various parishes. Msgr. Ryan: Well, I’ve been, I’ve been in Queens all those years. I spent ten years in St. Elizabeth in Woodhaven. Then I was here from 1981 to 1991. I spent ten years here as an Associate, went back to Woodhaven at St. Elizabeth as pastor for six years. Then Bishop Daly asked me to come to work for him as the territorial Vicar for north Queens which meant I would be the coordinator for sixty-two parishes in the northern half Queens County. Which sent me to doing, ironically, all the stuff my father had done, and he would have laughed because I was out in the fields going around meeting people, finding out what was going on It was almost like an education in sociology because as you know, North Queens is such a diverse place. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: And people bring a whole lot of customs and traditions, as well as, languages and foods and, things, and, ah, those four and a half years in the office were, were fascinating. I took a sabbatical for three months in Rome. When I finished that which was delightful, and, ah, when I finished that I was pastor of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Ridgewood for ten years. And, ah, that’s a very old established neighborhood, Ridgewood is, and, a fascinating place. And then, ah, two years ago, just about two years ago, Bishop De Mage who asked me if I would come back. He was pastor because Fr. Cunningham was retiring and he thought I would do well here where I had been. So that’s been my career and it has always been in Queens. Mary Gibbs: So, I gather, he probably saw how much you enjoyed being at St. Gregory’s the last time, so he (laugh…inaudible). Msgr. Ryan: Well, yes the parish, what happened here was that the parish celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011, and they round the whole, they brought the year to a close with a mass here in November of 2011, and they asked me if I would preach the homily for that mass, and I did. So then the following March when the Bishop got hold of me, he said, “I saw how people reacted to you at the anniversary celebration and I think you would do well.” He said, “I know that it could be difficult to go back to a place, but, I want you to do it.” So, I said, “All right.” Mary Gibbs: So, how do compare these two periods at St. Gregory’s in your personal life, the previous St. Gregory’s to today’s. Msgr. Ryan: It’s an interesting thing. It’s rather like being like Rip Van Winkle, because I was away from here for twenty-one years, and while I had contact with the parish and I maintained a lot of friendships with parishioners over the years, its difficult being here on the day-to-day basis. For one thing, there is this whole addition on the rectory is new since I was here. For another thing the church was turned back-to-front in its renovation. So that is different. But more importantly the population of the neighborhood has undergone a change in twenty-one years. It was largely Irish-Italian, but mostly, Irish, when I was here before. Mary Gibbs: That’s on the first… Msgr. Ryan: Here, my first time here. Those children many of them having grown up and moved on to other places, and the grownups have either passed away, or moved in with children, or they’re not here. There is still a significant continuity in that population, but it has been added by a large Pilipino population, and a very large Indian population. If you walked around the neighborhood, it has a definite Indian flavor. Mary Gibbs: I noticed. Msgr. Ryan: And many of them, of course, are not Catholic, but there is a surprising number of Indian families who are parishioners, are devoted people. So that’s the major change that I have seen, ah, when I go over to the school, I see children whose parents were in the school when I was here before, and like now I visit the second grade each week on Tuesday and there are three youngsters there, and two of them had mothers when I was here before, and one of them a father when I was here before. Mary Gibbs: My goodness, that is like serving two generations. So, now you, just gave me, a comparison within your parish. So how about, how has the neighborhood, changed from your childhood days? Msgr. Ryan: Well, which neighborhood? Remember I was not… Mary Gibbs: Queens, Forest Hills. Msgr. Ryan: Queens has become much more built up for one thing. The empty spaces have all but disappeared under the push of development. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: So, there are not lots around anymore, empty lots. That were… Mary Gibbs: Uh, huh, it’s all taken up? Msgr. Ryan: That were play spaces. That’s a change. The population is vastly more ah diverse than it was when I was growing up. Queens was largely Irish, German, Italian, Jewish. Ah, there were other, now, Queens always an interesting place because, because there were a lot of Spanish there too. There, there, were, were, ah, it was a whole mixed and gather of places, of peoples. But there is a far more strong Asian presence today than there was. The Jewish population is no longer the traditional Jewish population ah that I grew up with at Forest Hills, but there tend to be a Jewish people who, the BukharinJews, or, Jews from other parts of Russia. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: That have come and settled. But, of course, the whole way how the children grew up has changed. And I mentioned before that children today are far more supervised than structured in their … Mary Gibbs: Oh, yes. Msgr. Ryan: … recreational time, whereas, we were left to, our own devices and so developed a whole field of creativity in terms of inventing our own amusements, some of which, parents would have had coronaries if they had, you know. The standard dialogue was: Where you were? Out. What did you do? Nothing. Who were you with? Well, you know, John. Then the, then the questioning because parents didn’t really want to know, but we were home safe so that was, that was all so that whole structured dialogue took place. But occasionally we’d would wander off and come home late, then there was hell to play. Mary Gibbs: Any daring episodes you would like to share with us? Msgr. Ryan: Well, yes, I just took off one day and walked over to Kew Gardens to Conrad’s. He was the third classmate from Queen of Martyrs who is a priest, lived over in Kew Gardens. For whatever reason, the family was going to the movies and I didn’t want to go to the movies so I said, well I’ll walk over. And we walked, I mean we walked. We thought nothing of walking to Kew Gardens, or Richmond Hill, or anywhere. Mary Gibbs: But that is miles, right? Msgr. Ryan: Oh, yea, it was miles, but we walked, or, we took the bicycles, that was, but for whatever reason it wasn’t on the doorstep, because if our parents knew we went riding to the Canarsie Pier down the Belt Parkway, I had no idea what they would have done. But we had no GPS so they couldn’t track us, and we came home. Mary Gibbs: That was a far ways off. Msgr. Ryan: So, I think those were the major, differences in Queens. I do not think there is much of a sense of community cohesion as there was when I was growing up. Families lived in close proximity to one another, so you had, I had a lot of cousins at Queen of Martyr’s school because my mother’s family, a lot of them lived close by and they’d come up from Richmond Hill to Forest Hills and, and they were there. And that was so for other families. You had cousins in the place. And then people stayed. They didn’t move away, they stayed so you got multi-generational neighbors. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: When I was in St. Elizabeth’s there growing up there were children in the school there whose parents and grandparents who had graduated in the school. They had been there since the turn of the twentieth century. Mary Gibbs: My goodness. Msgr. Ryan: And they, they stayed. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: And the neighborhood had the feeling, sort of, everybody knew everybody. That’s not in evidence anymore. Now, I do have to say, out of that remains here. Bellerose is a little behind the time. There is still a great deal of community cohesion of which the church is the anchor. And, ah, I used to say when you go into a parish you always presume that everybody in this parish is related to everybody else until proven otherwise. But that rule does not hold true in Bellerose because at St. Gregory’s everybody is related to everybody else. And most of them are Lydons, they are…(inaudible). Mary Gibbs: Vast. Msgr. Ryan: The bloodline of everybody is somehow related to the Lydons. So it’s, Lydons it, that cohesion though, was a very strong thing and it, I don’t think it is there in the way that it was before people began to scatter. Mary Gibbs: So, how do you rate it. Msgr. Ryan: Well, I think that was a wonderful thing to grow up in, and I know you can’t hold on to things forever. But I just tend to like the continuity and settledness, so, I would miss that. Mary Gibbs: I know, ah, … I’m sure that your new parish, your new, the people that you attend to… Msgr. Ryan: Well I, I’m … Mary Gibbs: Your new congregation. Msgr. Ryan: Yeah. Mary Gibbs: … the new St. Gregory’s … Msgr. Ryan: The new population here. And then I’m doing fine with then. I’m getting to know people. It’s a danger when you go back to a parish because, you have to be careful you do not just presume you know the place which you don’t. Mary Gibbs: Definitely, I see here, as you indicated earlier, a rail fan, and before that I think you, were conducting tours. Msgr. Ryan: Oh, yes I used to be called upon by the Woodhaven Historical and Cultural Society. I haven’t heard from them in a while, but its seventeen years since I’m out of there. But used to, ah, take ah walking tours of Old Woodhaven. It was lots to fun. I used to explain to people by standing in front of St. Elizabeth’s Hall at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 84th Street and point across the street and tell them that the Civil War was fought right across the street for two, for forty years before a shot was fired on the battlefield because on the other side of Atlantic Avenue was Union Course Track and every year there was always a great rivalry between horses from the South and horses from the North. And in May of every year, I think it was May, there was the favorite horse of the North pitted against the favorite horse from the South. And people would come from all over the country to attend this. And, it sort of released tensions between the two halves of the United States. They’d settle it on the, on the, race track. In 1820-something, I think that year, the race was so famous that there were enough members of Congress present to pass a bill, if they had taken a vote, plus Andrew Jackson was there. But what served the race track was the beginnings of the Long Island Rail Road, ‘cause people could come off on the ferry at Brooklyn, on the train, and get off right at the racetrack. You see. Mary Gibbs: Wow. Msgr. Ryan: And Courier, or, not, most of their early lithographs were done of the races at, ah Union Course. And I think their first covered lithographs was of a race at the Union Course. But part of the Walk-e-talk would be to say, “Let’s just stop and say, well, that this was where the Civil War started, right here on this corner. Mary Gibbs: That was indeed exciting. I never thought about that, taking the war into consideration, and, and they forgot about the war. (Laugh). Msgr. Ryan: And then there was the great factory, Lalance and Jrosjaans, that was the enamel ware factory that took up about three, three square blocks, and they made enamel ware, and the tremendous output, so most of the neighborhood was employed by Lalance and Jrosjaans. Every year, they were Alsations, and Lalance went back to ah, Alsas, but ah Florian Jrosjaans stayed in this country. They had, they had been on Pearl Street on Manhattan, but Florian Jrojaans had his country estate in Woodhaven. He’d go out on the weekend on the train. And he had a beautiful estate, with ponds, and, and it was like a southern plantation. And then he decided, then, why should I commute to Manhattan when I could move the whole business out here. And gradually they built up a huge factory at, just on the south side of Atlantic Avenue, and they would, Florian Jrosjaans, every other year would go to Alsas and recruit workers and bring them over, and they would provide labor for the factory. And, he built a company town. Everything was built by the factory. The houses, the stores, the fire department, the park. Even St. Elizabeth’s Church originally was built by Florian Jrojaans, one of the few Catholic parishes that was founded by a Protestant. Mary Gibbs: This is so fascinating. So, you, apart from being this great rail fan… Msgr. Ryan: I’m also local history buff. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: I will sit and talk to … (inaudible)… about local history. Mary Gibbs: I would like to revisit that. Msgr. Ryan: Yes, sure. Mary Gibbs: Very much so. And then, more particularly, tell me, I know that you, along with your friend… (INTERRUPTION. Someone knocks on the door). Msgr. Ryan: Come in. (A person enters the room) Msgr. Ryan: Who? Patrick? Okay, fine. Thank you. I’ll listen. You’ll leave the door open. That’s fine. Msgr. Ryan: We were on the last train. Mary Gibbs: Yes, so, on the last Rockaway Rail line, Long Island Rockaway Rail line. Msgr. Ryan: John and I used to go on summer afternoons. That was a very busy service up until 1950 because the Rockaways of course were a great resort area, and people came down from Manhattan and went down there on the weekends. And it was so busy at one point because they ran, the BMT trains came off the Jamaica Avenue well at Chestnut Street, I think, and they had a connection with the Long Island Rail Road which was on the service of Atlantic Avenue. So the subway trains would as far as the Long Island Rail Road trains, and there was a huge amount of traffic. But they crossed the Jamaica Bay on two huge old wooden trestles that were a great problem because they were such a fire, and in the winter when the bay froze, they would be knocked out of alignment. And by 1950, the railroad was in a terrible shape. It had been taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad, so the Pennsylvania Railroad could get trackage rights in Long Island City for their new Penn Station. That’s a whole other story. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: But at any rate things were really bad by 1950, and in May 1950 there was a huge fire on the trestle. So the Long Island Railway said, “Ah, forget about it. We are not running this service anymore. It’s not what it used to be. We’re going to sell it, lock, stock and barrel to the Transit Authority of New York,” which they did. And they sold it all the way from, what’s was called the White Pot under jump where connected with the main line at Forest Hills all the way down through the Rockaway Peninsula. And, they began to rebuild, the subway did a trestle and bridges over Jamaica Bay, and by 1956, they were able to start subway service from Liberty Avenue going south to the Rockaways and that still exists. But up until 1962, the Long Island Rail Road still ran two passenger trains a day between Penn Station and Ozone Park. They had gone down originally to Hamilton Beach, but then when the connection was made in the subway, that ended in 1956, so form 1956 on, they went only as far as Ozone Park. One train went into Manhattan in the morning, and the train came out in the afternoon. And it had a certain loyal ridership. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: Because it was a quick way to get in and out of Manhattan. Mary Gibbs: Okay. Msgr. Ryan: So, on summer afternoons, Msgr. McGruirl and I would mosey up to the Parkside station at Metropolitan Avenue, and we would watch the evening commuter train come in. And we did that with some regularity. That would come in, it left, left Penn Station at 5:35 and so probably about 5:55 – 6 o’clock it was at Parkside, and if we ran fast enough, we’d make it home in time for dinner. But then when they announced that they were going, ah, to cease service and abandon the line we said, “No, no, we have to be on the last train.” Well, the other thing we used to do, we used to, and we walked everywhere. We used to walk over to Regal Park and we would ride the train from Rego Park to Parkside. And I think, I still have a punched ticket from that somewhere. It cost about fifteen cents. If we could scrape up fifteen cents. And most often, the conductor didn’t even conduct the fare ‘cause two kids riding from Rego Park to Parkside Avenue. Mary Gibbs: How old were you then? Msgr. Ryan: We were…in our early teens, I guess, twelve, thirteen, I guess, we did that. So we decided we would ride the last train, that was going to run on June the 8th, 1962, and we were juniors in high school at that point. John was in Archbishop Molloy High School, and he had a classmate who lived in Forest Hills, Henry Sawiki, who subsequently became a, a Marist Brother. So the three of us decided we were going to take, and we took the subway into Manhattan, bought tickets and we boarded the train at Penn Station thinking that we were that we were going to get off at Parkside which would be the convenient stop. So we came along and as we came through the White Pot under jump coming off the mainline at, off the stop at Regal Park and then down, the commuters opened the champagne and started to celebrate the last trip. So we said, “Well, why should we get off while the party is going on, and, we accepted.… Mary Gibbs: (Laugh). Msgr. Ryan: …ah, paper cups of champagne and said, the hell with Parkside, and we stayed on all the way to the end of the line at Ozone Park where we subsequently got ourselves photographed a few times. There is an issue of the Pennsylvania Railroad’s historical magazine. They did two issues on the Rockaway Branch, two articles in the issues, and in the second one they had pictures of the last train at Ozone Park. And we had come, had come off and were standing on the platform, and this was taken from the opposite side, but when you look, and some, a parishioner at Miraculous… (Inaudible). And I said, ‘Holy cow a minute!” Because I was standing there. And I would show you here too. There was a picture at Metropolitan Avenue as the train was about to pull out of Parkside on its last run, and we are in, we we’re in that picture. So, ah, that was the last, the last, last train. I think we probably had enough money to get on the Woodhaven bus and then half tipsy ride back up to Forest Hills at the end of that adventure. But we saw the last, the last train. Mary Gibbs: Can you remember what you guys were talking about? Msgr. Ryan: Well, it was, you know, we had our cameras and we were taking pictures. And as we went through Forest Park I was leaning out taking pictures. I had just backed into the car, I got just the window, it was the old equipment and the window would slam in on us. Thank God I did not have my head out when that came down. But I don’t, you know, I don’t really remember our conversation, except that it was a very bittersweet occasion. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: And we’ve lived ever since then and hoped that service would one day be restored. I don’t know if you’ve gone on to the website, Arrts Arrchives. Ah, it’s a fascinating, pictorial, ah, guide to Queens because it’s all railroad pictures and as a bonus you get you get pictures of, ah, all the places the railroad went through. So, this picture that I am talking about of us is on Arts Archives which just did, ah, three new segments. One is the Madawauk Stations, and then the Rego Park, and down to Parkside and then one beyond that down to Brooklyn Manor, and, ah... (Inaudible words while getting up to go to the computer). Msgr. Ryan: Take a look at… Mary Gibbs: Yes. So you do have pictures. Msgr. Ryan: Oh, yes. Well, they’re on here. Just one second. (Inaudible). Mary Gibbs: So as an avid railroad person are you following the Queensway Project? Msgr. Ryan: Oh, yes I am. Mary Gibbs: What do you think about that? Msgr. Ryan: Well, I certainly hope they revive service. I don’t see any need for a walkway there, but I do see need for better transportation and I think that would be accomplished, and they’ll cut off at Parkside. Here we go. (Msgr. Ryan is now sitting in front of a computer at his desk showing me pictures of the Long Island Rail Road on the Arrts Arrchives website). Mary Gibbs: So there is the QueensWay Trust, the Friends of QueensWay and the Trust for Public Land. Msgr. Ryan: Yes, I am not terribly happy about all of that, and I’d much rather see it restored to rail service. Mary Gibbs: Okay. Isn’t that so you’re an advocate of the railroad service. Msgr. Ryan: Oh, the railroad service. See this is how it looked when we were growing up. That’s the Rockaway Branch coming off the under jump and running South. It was like being in the country. Mary Gibbs: It is. Msgr. Ryan: You were six miles from Long Island City. There’s the milestone. See. Mary Gibbs: Oh, my goodness. Msgr. Ryan: And these are the old days, but here’s Fleet Street when we were growing up. Oh, there’s a rail fan trip, before the service stopped in ’62. And look at this. I would assume they had turned the third rail off ‘cause they are letting everybody run all over the tracks here. Those are Budd cars so they are self-propelled. Mary Gibbs: Oh, they are. So the people at the side there. Msgr. Ryan: These are all rail fans. Mary Gibbs: Isn’t it dangerous like to be at the side there? Msgr. Ryan: Well, it should be if the, if the third raid was energized. Mary Gibbs: Oh. Msgr. Ryan: That was Fleet Street when John and I were growing up. That’s 1954, and this was the pig farm over here. There was a man who raised pigs. Mary Gibbs: My goodness. Msgr. Ryan: Now let’s see. Okay, Parkside, Parkside, Parkside…Here we go. There’s a train coming into Parkside in the 1940s, and this train is going into Manhattan. You see. Mary Gibbs: Yes. Msgr. Ryan: Van de Vere’s dairy farm is still here. Those are the people going to Rockaway on that platform. Mary Gibbs: Wow. Msgr. Ryan: And this is the train coming in, going into Manhattan. Mary Gibbs: Mmmm. Msgr. Ryan: This, it looked a little bit bereft in the 1954 picture. This is after the trestle fire and you could see the station houses dilapidated. Mary Gibbs: Oh, yes. Msgr. Ryan: Then, another one like that. This was what Metropolitan Avenue looked like. This was the station at Metropolitan. You can’t see it here, but, Van de Vere’s farm is still over here, I think, that’s where we would go. Now, let’s see. Okay in the later day…they tore down one south bound platform, and they, they put up one track and put up cinders down and put a temporary station. Mary Gibbs: So we’re looking at… Msgr. Ryan: We’re looking at trains going south. Mary Gibbs: From? Msgr. Ryan: From Penn Station. It’s come from Penn, its going down to Ozone Park. But they took out one track and built this low level platform across it. And here we are. Now, this is the train that has stopped at Parkside station and it’s beginning its run over Metropolitan, and it is on its way to Ozone Park. If you look at the, at these boys here… Mary Gibbs: They are… Msgr. Ryan: Hanging out... Mary Gibbs: ...hanging out of the window Msgr. Ryan: That was us, you’re looking at, that’s me, I think. Mary Gibbs: Oh, that’s you! Msgr. Ryan: And that’s John McGuirl and Henry Sawiki. But that was us in the lead car hanging out the window in the lead car hanging out the windows. Mary Gibbs: This is the last ride? Msgr. Ryan: That’s the last ride. Mary Gibbs: It is. Msgr. Ryan: That’s June the 8th, 1962. And we got caught, they must be somebody standing on the tracks here taking ah photos and there’s, and see there’s the motorman walking around to see if anybody still standing on the tracks, and he is going to leave and go on to, ah… Mary Gibbs: This is certainly historic. Msgr. Ryan: Oh, it’s wonderful. And you’ll see all sorts of pictures in the Arrts Archive. Mary Gibbs: This is a gold mine here. Msgr. Ryan: That’s the old wooden trestle that the train ran across ‘til they the day service closed. It was a wonder it didn’t collapse. It was all wood going over the Montauk Branch. Mary Gibbs: It is wooden, yes, Msgr. Ryan: It was. Mary Gibbs: I could see it. Yes. Msgr. Ryan: See it? Mary Gibbs: Yes Msgr. Ryan: I think John walked over that. I don’t think I ever did with him. But look at it, eh? That was like the Old West. Mary Gibbs: Yes, yes. Msgr. Ryan: Look, see that’s… Mary Gibbs: No wonder you want it to be reestablished. Msgr. Ryan: Established safely. There’s a steam locomotive going underneath on the Montauk division. Mary Gibbs: And who is that person standing… Msgr. Ryan: He is the brakeman, I think, or he’s a railroad official. Mary Gibbs: Oh. Msgr. Ryan: This is the Montauk division. Mary Gibbs: Okay. Msgr. Ryan: And this is the old Rockaway division up here, see. Mary Gibbs: So that is a steam train? Msgr. Ryan: That’s a steam, he is on the tender at the back there. The locomotive is ahead of him. Mary Gibbs: Alright. Msgr. Ryan: But you can see, ah, wonderful old pictures of Queens. (inaudible) Mary Gibbs: These are great pictures you’ve got here, very clear. Msgr. Ryan: They, they’re wonderful and I get all interested with this stuff, see. So, this is what it looked like after it was abandoned. Mary Gibbs: Mmm. Msgr. Ryan: Very sad. But at any rate, that’s it. Mary Gibbs: So, you have, like, um, your entire life has been around the railroad system. Msgr. Ryan: (coughs) Oh, indeed it has been, yes. Mary Gibbs: And I know that you, like said, you, you would like to see it reinstated. Msgr. Ryan: Oh, I would very much like it. I hope I live to get to ride the first train. Mary Gibbs: I hope you, you get your wish. Msgr. Ryan: (laugh) That would be something to be on the first train and the last train. But I don’t know. Mary Gibbs: I, I certainly do, and thank you so much for sharing. Msgr. Ryan: Okay, okay, I have to move on to other things. Mary Gibbs: Thank you, again. Msgr. Ryan: But someday you’ll come back and we’ll talk more about other things, and, ah… Mary Gibbs: I will, I will. Msgr. Ryan: I can, ah, I can… Mary Gibbs: I really do appreciate your sharing with us. Msgr. Ryan: This is from LaLance and Jrojaans. This is what they made. The factory in Woodhaven. And you could always tell… Mary Gibbs: What is, what is that? Msgr. Ryan: These, these were all the things we used then. Coffee pots… Mary Gibbs: Oh. Msgr. Ryan: …and our know platters, and you can tell because they always have their thing, L&G. Mary Gibbs: Oh. Msgr. Ryan: So, if you don’t see that, it’s not the real stuff. I have… Mary Gibbs: But, it, it looks almost brand new. Msgr. Ryan: It does look brand new, but it’s very old. People don’t use coffee pots like this anymore. Mary Gibbs: (Laugh) Thank you, again, Msgr. Ryan, for sharing. ",
  "Saavedra_Carmen_timecode.txt": "00:00 - 01:48 Carmen reflects on the reasons and motivations to come to the United States upon finding herself unable to find employment in Peru, after returning from Venezuela, where she was working for some time. Work was scarce in Peru and because Carmen had to provide for her two children: Carol and Alfredo, she decided to make the trip to the U.S. to try her luck and provide for her family, in spite of her suffering for leaving her two children behind. 01:48 - 6:21 Carmen explains there were no preparations for the trip, that everything happened in a sudden manner. She had a young cousin who had expressed interest in making the trip as well so both decided to leave Peru together. 03:00 - At the time, there was an airline called TEXA which flew all throughout South America. They made several stops before arriving in the U.S. First they stopped in Ecuador, and later in Colombia where they transferred to a Panama bound flight. But to make this transfer they had to go from Bogota to Medellin by bus. They were thoroughly searched at the Panama airport precisely because they were coming from Colombia. They stayed in the country for a few days. 4:22 - The next stop on the trip was Costa Rica, followed by Guatemala, where they took another bus bound to Mexico, DF. Hosted by a friend of Carmen’s sister-in-law, they stayed a few days in Mexico as well. From there, they left toward Nogales. Once in Nogales, they had to seek someone who would smuggle them through the U.S - Mexico border. They stayed at a hotel nearby until they could find that person. 5:45 - 6:20 Carmen explains that their search was useless, and that the way they were able to finally get in touch with a “pollero” was through the hotel receptionist who asked the travelers if they were looking to “go north”. When they answered “yes” he told them the next group was leaving within the next half hour and that they could join if they wanted to. 6:20 - Instructed to leave their belongings behind, even their passports, Carmen and her cousin joined the group. They were taken to a site that had a big hole on a wall filled with pipes. These pipes were not big enough that you could walk inside them. Rather, people had to crawl. Carmen tells that they probably crawled for some twenty minutes, which to her seemed like a whole day’s length of time. 7:11 - This passage, Carmen recalls, was a horrifying experience. It was pitch dark so Carmen could not see who was in front or in the back of her, and there were rats, which they could only feel making their way through the pipes. Carmen says she thought of turning back at some point during this journey but what made her change her mind was thinking about the others. There was no choice but to keep going, until they came out to a park. 7:45 - The “pollero” left the group waiting to go find a car so he could transport everyone to their destinations. They stayed in the house of a relative of one of the group’s members. Carmen was now on United States land, the Nogales on the Arizona side. 8:13 - Carmen describes it was the first days of January and that she had no idea how cold the United States could get. The man who hosted them said the group could stay in the garage which was an icebox. There was a bed where Carmen slept with her cousin. Together they kept each other warm. They were shivering from the icing temperatures. 9:00 - It was so cold in the garage that when the host checked up on his guests the next day first thing in the morning, he asked them “are you alive?”. He then sent them to his son’s house where they could shower. Carmen told the man’s son that she had a sister who could send her money to buy a ticket to New York. 9:30 - Carmen is grateful to this day for her sister’s generosity during that time of transition. She and her husband sent money to fly both Carmen and her cousin to New York. The man’s son took the women to the airport. Carmen expresses she felt as if she were blind for not speaking a word of English. 10:00 - Once at the airport, a couple directed the women to the gate for the New York flight, which would stop in Dallas first. Carmen tells how she and her cousin unaware that they had transfer to another plane at the Dallas Airport, remained seated in the same plane until the cleaning crew pointed out they should have left. 11:00 - 11:20 Carmen arrived to the La Guardia Airport, where her sister and her sister’s husband picked her up. 11:27 How did you feel while you were making this journey? 11:27 - 12:20 Carmen says it was painful to arrive in the States because she had anticipated she would be sent back. Once she had arrived, she couldn’t believe it and her first thought was “when will I see my children again?” Only then did it really dawn on her that she had left her kids behind. She felt immense sadness. 12:20 - Thankfully, Carmen’s sister-in-law was able to get Carmen a job at a sweatshop. That’s how she started in the States. 12:35 - 13:20 What did you imagine when you said you wanted to get back to your children? Carmen knew she had to do everything in her power to bring her kids to the States. That there was no turning back. She would support them until she was able to bring them to her side. That was all that was on her mind. 13:25 Let’s talk about your first days here in New York 13:25 - 14:20 Carmen talks about how sad her first days were in the U.S, especially because she kept thinking about her children, wondering when she would see them again. Also, she had never experienced such cold weather because it’s never that cold in Perú. She thought to herself she’d stay a couple of years and end up going back to her children. She’d never be able to resist such frigid temperatures. 14:25 - 18:36 How did you start working? Carmen explains she started working at a sweatshop. Her job consisted on “trimming” clothing pieces and any other tasks assigned to her as needed. With time, Carmen was able to move out on her own, as she was initially living with her sister. Later on she was introduced to a Colombian woman who offered her a room in her apartment and in turn introduced her to other women who worked in a showroom, manufacturing designer dresses. They told her she should go work with them as a sample maker. That weekend, Carmen went to her sister’s house and asked her to show her how to use the sewing machine. She had no experience as a seamstress. She recalls her sister laughing at her. However, with the women’s support and having developed good rapport with Mr. Novak, her boss who trusted she’d learn quickly because she was young (Carmen was 27 at the time), Carmen learned from the designer and her colleagues and this is how Carmen started her career as a sample maker. 18:36 - 20:40 How was your relationship with your coworkers? Carmen says she’s always had amicable work relationships because she was always willing to help others, specially because the majority of her coworkers were also Latino, from all over. The sweatshop environment, on the other hand, was very restricted. The workers had hardly any time or opportunity to develop friendships since the working pace demanded all of their attention. And when there was no work, Mr. Xu would send everyone home. The Chinese workers were the fastest therefore Carmen and the other Latino workers were expected to keep up the speed. 20:40 - 21:30 Were you during these times afraid of immigration? Carmen explains she was fearful of ICE at all times. That she learned to be on the lookout as soon as she arrived. She heard stories of raids at sweatshops and knew exactly what to do in case ICE showed up at work. She’d either run or say she was Puerto Rican. 21:30 - What would have happened if immigration showed up at work? Carmen looks back and reflects on really not knowing what could have happened for sure but being certain that she might have gotten deported on the spot. And even when she had wished to go back to Perú and reunite with her children, she had realized she could do so much more here in the U.S. than back in Perú.. It’d be best, she thought, for all of us to be here in the States than back home starving. 22:25 - 24:00 Did you develop friendships with your neighbors in Jackson Heights? Carmen mentions her neighbors were rather distant but that she and her brother Jorge had many friends who would visit them often. Jorge had migrated to the U.S. in a similar fashion; making several stops along the way, just as Carmen had done, although she is not sure Jorge crawled his way across the border through park pipes. He did though, stop in El Salvador, where he experienced that country’s civil war. Carmen was one of three siblings. 24:00 - 29:02 On encountering her sibling Jorge in the U.S Walter, Carmen and Jorge, Jorge had a wife and was pregnant. Jorge and Carmen bought a house together and rented a room so they could pay the mortgage. Carmen came with Piera, a cousin. Both became closer because of the passage. Piera then went to live with her aunt and sister. Carmen recalls the bad and good things of those first days in the US. She says mostly everything was good because she had family around. The saddest was not having her kids around. She had a good friend called Zoila, who was 20 years older. She was diagnosed with colon cancer and Carmen does not know whether she’s still alive. Fabiola was another good friend. She was the assistant to the designer at work. Among men, she recalls having only one good friendship with Walter. And then talks about romantic relationships. Richard became Carmen’s husband, She met him at a club in Manhattan, one night Carmen went out with coworkers. Richard married Carmen and in that way helped her adjust her legal status and bring her children over to the U.S. 29:07 - 32:01 Carmen lived in Queens for 9 years. She talks about her life in Queens as good specially because she never had to learn the language. She didn’t think it was necessary. Richard only spoke English and he was the only reason Carmen felt she needed to learn. Other than that, there was no reason to do it. And even when the language barrier could have been an impediment for the relationship to blossom, Carmen and Richard kept seeing each other. They used gestures to communicate and Carmen mostly listened. Upon her sister’s insistence, Carmen registered at FIT. She wanted to be a fashion designer. However, she never finished a degree because she became pregnant with her daughter Vanessa. 32:01 - 34:36 Richard used to work in Manhattan and only spent the weekends at Carmen’s. His parents were not aware he had married Carmen. He claimed that if they were to find out, they would disown him. So he never told them. Later on, Carmen tells, he developed a condition that impeded him to have sexual relations with her. He became impotent and after consulting several specialists determined he would not be able to satisfy Carmen and expressed to her he didn’t mind if she found a sexual partner. Carmen didn’t take this well and decided to go to Perú for some time. She didn’t tell Richard when she came back but when he finally visited her, she asked him for a divorce. 34:36 - 37:25 On Carmen’s other relationship The other person sort of sneaked into Carmen’s life. She didn’t really love him. But she thought he would be a good father to her children. They were to stay together if and when Carmen’s children approved of him. And they did. Carmen didn’t really have a relationship with her children while they were separated because when she left them, they were very young. They couldn’t possibly grasp what was happening. They were being raised by their grandmother. Carmen remembered them as toddlers and Carmen was surprised to see them looking so different after 4 years apart. It was Carmen’s most beautiful moment to see her children once again. But they didn’t really remember her. They knew about her mom only through photos and grandma’s stories. 37:25 Life in Queens Carmen tells about Queens. She had everything she needed there. Queens was her life. She then compares Peru and Queens. Peru was the best time of her life. She was a young working woman coming of age, with lots of friends and few responsibilities. What she’d earn, she’d spend on her and her parents. 39:40 - 40:41 Carmen shares that the teenage years are the best. Everything is taken for granted and one must not work for anything since everything is coming from one’s parents. Or at least one believes it must be that way. 40:41 - 43:15 On maturing: Carmen matured suddenly she says, when she lost her husband. She had everything and then it was all taken from her. She had felt as if she had been pushed off a cliff suddenly as she was standing at the highest point. This feeling was not comparable to fearing ICE, she expresses because even though she knew there was always a chance at being caught undocumented, it wasn’t real to her. It was like a myth because she never experienced it. 43:15 - 44:05 Was there or was there not a difference between living a life as an undocumented/documented person? Carmen recalls the kind of stuff one couldn’t do if one was an undocumented person living in the United States. One was not being able to fly outside of the U.S. and the other was not being able to file taxes. So whether you had or didn’t have legal documents to live in the States did make a difference. Also, being documented provided better job opportunities. 44:15 - 45:30 “It’s so much what you have lived and so little what you can tell” Carmen tells about this precise moment in time when she’s probably the happiest. She has found a good man to share a life with. She compares him to Lucho, her deceased husband, only this “Lucho” has money. Carmen says he’s probably a gift from God. 45:30 - 47:12 On transitioning to Virginia Carmen shares that the family decided to move to Virginia right about the time Alfredo was due to enter middle school. The family owned an apartment there, which they had bought for investment purposes. And because Virginia’s lifestyle was more laid back and things were slower, it would be a better environment to grow in for the children, specially right about this time when Alfredo was entering puberty. 47:12 - 51:40 On comparing lifestyles: Queens vs. Virginia As an older person, Carmen considered life in Queens pretty calm but not for her children. She didn’t like the New York environment for them. Things were happening too soon here. She recalls that when she visited what would be Alfredo’s middle school in Queens she had observed young teenage girls covered in make-up. She had also heard there were drugs being passed around inside the schools. She was afraid for her children. And she didn’t stop to think these problems were not unique to the United States or New York City. She reaffirms though she believed them to be less serious back then when she moved to Virginia. It would be easier to have more control over her children in Virginia, she thought. Her children were picked up from the house and dropped off at school every day by the school bus. And at the school, and in Virginia in general, children were better behaved and less troublesome. This was not a big city. It was more like a town, so the kids were not bad kids. The majority of the town’s people were white, anglo-saxon looking, and there weren’t any restaurants that served foods other than traditional American. It was later on that people of other backgrounds started to move to the town. 51:41 - 53:45 On the kids of the town Carmen knew all of the kids who lived in the building her family moved to in Virginia. Not all of them were white Americans. There were Muslim and African kids, immigrant kids who came from hard-working households, as Carmen’s. And it was when the family moved to Virginia that Carmen started speaking more English. Her husband influenced the family’s decision to move as well. His business of installing air conditioner had failed in New York and because he had family in Virginia, he wanted to try his luck there. 53:50 - 58:23 Carmen’s children suffered at first because they didn’t know the language. However, they learned within months even when Carmen herself couldn’t help them. She explains that even when her English proficiency was limited as she attended school, she had no issues understanding the material since fashion design is very hands-on and methodical. It also helped that she was working as a sample maker at the time. 58:23 - 1:00:38 Carmen tells about her children and how they learned English. She figures that because they arrived to elementary school and were advanced academically, they didn’t need much support. She refers to the United States education as more limited and less stringent compared to the education in Perú, whereas, at least in high school, everyone is mandated to pass a determined set of courses to graduate. In the United States, you can pick and choose. 1:00:38 On bringing parent to the United States Carmen’s parents were Carmen’s children’s parents in her absence. This is the reason why she wanted to bring grandma and grandpa to the United States. Her children knew her as a mother but they were not used to her so Carmen thought it would be best to have her parents around while the children got used to living next to their mother. Otherwise, for them it would have been like living with a stranger. Carol and Alfredo came as residents and the grandparents came accompanying the children on tourist visas. Later on Carmen’s sister became a citizen and claimed both parents so they could become residents as well 1:02:01 - 1:03:19 On the hardships of accomplishing all of this Carmen expresses she is sharing the most transcending moments, which she believes are the most important. Time, she says, makes the mind choose the things it wants to keep. She is happy to have let the sad moments go, and that she can only remember the best moments. 1:03:22 - 1:06:22 Prompted to share the difficult memories, Carmen talks about her failed marriage with the father of her last child, Vanessa. He was an alcoholic who led her to bankruptcy, and who became an ogre after having made her believe he was a good person. She says he changed after her children arrived. Carmen’s parents did not like him at all and she hardly had any relationship with his family, whom he only saw during social gatherings. 1:06:22 - 1:08:14 Carmen goes on to share she only put up with Fernando, her former abusive husband, because she heavily relied on him for financial support. But when she was determined to leave him. She resolved to work two jobs in order to support her parents and children in Virginia. 1:08:14 On children assimilating Carmen speaks of her children adapting to New York and then to Virginia. The New York - Virginia transition was easier than the Peru - United States one. And they actually liked Virginia more. They developed more friendships as they had more time to do so, and felt more independent overall since they no longer had to rely on grandma and grandpa for school drop-offs and pick-ups. ",
  "Said_Abdul_timecode.txt": "My name is Abdul. For a living right now I work as a bartender in the Marriott hotel, near La Guardia airport. This particular place I�ve lived in for four and a half years. I�ve been in Astoria 15 years. I love Astoria. It�s very convenient. Before I lived in Brooklyn and it was a long way away. It�s quiet as well. And now it�s got a lot less quiet though. A lot of people are moving here from Manhattan, particularly. The area up around Steinway has changed a lot. I was working in real estate in Florida for a long time. I enjoy working as a bartender and I get enough money to get by. I am from Morocco originally. I moved to the United States 26 year ago. I like it here though now. I�m planning to move here in Astoria though to 21st street just around the corner in the new building. I�m waiting for a friend of mine to come down from Boston. I love going to have my breakfast up in the park, take my car up there. Man I love that place! I have two kids in Florida but I�m divorced, and they live with their mother, who�s from Brooklyn New York. Sometimes I go back home to Morocco, where I have a brother. I like to travel. I just came back recently from a trip, I was away about six weeks. I went four weeks to Morocco and two weeks to Spain. I�m from a small town in East Morocco, a very French part of the country, because the North is much more Spanish, South is French and North is Spanish. I read about the police stuff [a story reported in Associated Press about a New York Police Department surveillance program focused on Moroccans � not because of any specific allegations against individuals but in order to build up a detailed picture of the city�s Moroccan community, in support of the government�s anti-terrorism efforts]. It�s part of what�s going on in the world, the past decade. A lot of people are getting confused. It�s part of what�s going on. What�s happening in the Middle East now, in Egypt etc. � I am optimistic that everything will be alright. It�s like the sky, one minute it�s all cloudy and the next minute it�s clear. They needed to get rid of those bad guys who�d been there, for 30, 40 years. That makes no sense. You need a system like here, very four years if you don�t like who�s in charge you get rid of him. And really these people were here for a lifetime. And now there�s a new generation who don�t buy those things. They want change. That�s right, it came from within. Economy: some bad apples have made things bad for everything. Things go up, and things go down. Everywhere there are houses going down and new ones going up. This one where we are sitting is going to be knocked down and made into apartments. It�s good business for the owners. People smell the money and they see people moving in. It�s not easy to find an apartment. Ten years ago when I moved here everything was for rent, for rent, but now it�s hard to find a place. The one opposite had two families in it. And they�ve rebuilt like 14-16 apartments. When I was living in Brooklyn I thought that no-one wanted to live here. Before I had a friend who lived here who said come on over, Manhattan is just over the river. That�s where I worked all the time. It�s partly what people think of Queens. Astoria has history, waves of immigration. I worked in an Irish restaurant in Manhattan - that�s where I worked - more quiet here than in Manhattan, and Manhattan is business, everyone�s all about business�here people are more relaxed. ",
  "SaintLouis_Elsie_timecode.txt": "Elsie Saint-Louis, the current Executive Director of HAUP (Haitian Americans United for Progress) discusses the history, present, and future of the organization and the population(s) they serve. The services HAUP provides fall into four main categories: family support, youth and children’s services, services to the special needs community, and immigration services. 00:00:00 – 00:00:16 Metadata 00:00:16 – 00:02:02 Briefly, Elsie discusses her personal background and what led her to become involved with, and eventually Executive Director of, HAUP. Elsie started working with the agency in 1993 as a volunteer and held various roles as a board member and consultant before becoming the organization’s Executive Director in 2004. Elsie was born and raised in Haiti and immigrated to the U.S. when she was 14. Her academic background is in political science and she holds a Master’s degree in business. Elsie is a devout Catholic and in addition to her work at HAUP, she is the music director for her parish. 00:02:02 – 00:05:58 Elsie’s path to HAUP Previously, Elsie worked in development with the Archdiocese of New York. Her first exposure to HAUP was when someone suggested that she write a grant for the organization. The Archdiocese had a connection with HAUP because the Haitian Apostolate, run by Bishop Guy Sansaricq (a founding member of HAUP), was housed in the lower level of HAUP. Later, another founding member asked her to be on, and then chair, the organization’s Youth Board. Elsie subsequently served on the organizations’s Board and also served HAUP as a consultant. She began working at HAUP full-time in 2000 and was asked to take on the role of Executive Director in 2004. 00:05:58 – 00:09:37 On HAUP’s growth Over time, HAUP has grown from having a budget of $62,000 to being a $5 million agency. HAUP provides “cradle-to-grave” services. The services HAUP provides fall into four main categories: family support, youth and children’s services, services to the special needs community, and immigration services. Over time, the needs of the community and the services that HAUP provides have evolved. HAUP serves anyone in need in the community but has always maintained reputation as being a “safe zone” for Haitians. 00:09:37 – 00:19:43 HAUP’s evolution, cont’d HAUP was founded in 1976, in the basement of Sacred Heart parish in Cambria Heights, Queens. During 1976, there was an influx of immigrants from Haiti who were fleeing political unrest. Initially, HAUP was primarily focused on immigration, translation, and ESL services. As needs of the community have changed, so have the services that HAUP provides. At the same time, there has been a high level of continuity. Currently, with the recent changes to immigration policy, HAUP is returning strongly to its immigration advocacy work in a way that hadn’t felt so urgent since 1976. HAUP is advocating against the repeal of DACA and TPS (temporary protected status) for Haitians. HAUP is the THE organization that serves Haitians in Queens, so there can be a lot of pressure to provide more services than they are able. 00:19:43 – 00:22:29 HAUP’s evolution cont’d Although it feels as though progression on immigration reform has suffered recent setbacks, the services that HAUP provides have expanded over time. This is especially true regarding HAUP’s youth programming. New youth programs include: • STEM after school programs • Summer leadership program for middle school students • College fairs • Universal pre-school 00:22:29** – 00:28:10 On the culture and heritage of HAUP as an organization HAUP was founded (and has prevailed) because Haitians from different political and economic backgrounds banded together to support a common cause. When HAUP was founded, people from all walks of life pooled their money together to purchase the HAUP building. “Our mandate is to be the eyes and ears and the support and the heart of the community through our services and our programs” HAUP staff has modeled programs after what they would have wanted for themselves, their own children, etc. HAUP is family-oriented and has a strong culture of mentorship on the staff. Many of the staff have spent their entire career at HAUP, and there are many young people choosing to start their careers at HAUP, as well. HAUP is an organization that embraces and understands culture and Haitian culture 00:28:10** – 00:35:36 On how the Haitian immigrant narrative differs from other U.S. immigrant narratives The Haitian immigrant narrative is multifaceted: it is economic, racial, national, and linguistic. Haitians are very diverse in terms of how they function as a community Many Haitians grew up under dictatorship and moved to the U.S. to escape it. Many (but not all) immigrants were well-off financially in Haiti, as opposed to many immigrants from other places. Haiti is very class-defined: there is an intellectual elite, a small economic elite, and a large lower class, but little to no middle class. Many Haitians and Haitian-Americans have strong familial and economic ties to Haiti. Haitian identity in America is inextricable intertwined with, but must be differentiated from, African American identity. “This country has found a way to keep everybody’s heritage separate, minus the blacks. Once you talk about the blacks, they group them all as African American”. 00:35:36 – 00:39:46 On learning from HAUP youth Not all youth involved in HAUP programs are Haitian; youth are very diverse. HAUP programs put value on recognizing and engaging with students’ individual cultures and heritage. Currently, HAUP is doing a lot to engage with young adults who passed through HAUP youth programs as children. HAUP leadership has been learning to speak their language. Elsie has found that millennials and people from older generations engage differently when it comes to making an impact; for millennials, having something on paper isn’t enough, they need to see action. 00:39:46 – 00:44:09 What it means to be a “safe space” for Haitian immigrants Safe space isn’t something that’s created; it’s earned. First and foremost, HAUP provides physical and legal safety for vulnerable people. Every individual is given same quality of service and care regardless of their background. At HAUP, it is important to make every client feel valued and respected, especially since as an immigrant they may be feeling helpless and frustrated. HAUP also provides places where Haitians can find others who speak their language and understand their background and experience. 00:44:09 – 00:51:18 On funding—successes and challenges Nothing is easy to fund. Because of size of the organization, HAUP is no longer able to qualify for the smaller grants they need, but also not big enough to get other funding they need. HAUP receives discretionary funding from electoral officials for family support services. HAUP competes for RFP’s (request for proposal) for youth services, education, and universal pre-K. Funding has always been a challenge for HAUP; they have never had enough money to provide all the services they want to. The community HAUP serves isn’t a community that is necessarily capable of financially supporting the organization. Over time, HAUP has become more strategic about pursuing funding by delineating the services the organization provides into four main categories: family support, youth and children’s services, services to the special needs community, and immigration services. Two initiatives that are extremely difficult to fund are programs for undocumented people and advocacy. In 2016, all funding for HAUP’s ESL program was cut. HAUP continued to offer the same quality of ELS programs with volunteer labor until HAUP regained the funding. 00:51:18 – 00:58:23 HAUP under the Trump administration Advocacy for immigration reform started to regain urgency during the Bush administration. The community hoped for a serious strengthening of the system under the next administration, and although Obama did not harm the immigration system, his administration did not adequately protect it from future changes. During the period following the 2016 election (November 2016 – February 2017), the Haitian community was very afraid, and felt attacked and unsafe. The repeal of TPS (temporary protected status) has been the biggest challenge for the Haitian community. TPS is usually allocated 18 months at a time, with some shorter extensions, but it is always unpredictable whether it will be extended after each deadline. There is a constant struggle between fighting for DACA or TPS—which one do you prioritize with limited advocacy resources? 00:58:23 – 01:01:33 On her hopes for HAUP’s future HAUP will celebrate its 45th anniversary next year (2019). HAUP’s 5 year plan is to smoothly transition with government restructuring while maintaining quality, compliance, and financial viability. HAUP hopes to be even stronger at 90 years than they are at 45. They would also like to work on making their advocacy work more efficient and effective. 01:01:33 – 01:03:56 Closing HAUP is not just the Haitian organization in Queens. Elsie wants others to understand that HAUP’s contribution is beyond what it does for the Haitian community and culture. HAUP is open to teaching and receiving and learning; it is not a separate group from what makes up Queens. HAUP wants to be part of the Queens dialogue, considered as an integral part of the fabric of Queens. HAUP isn’t just a Haitian organization, it is a Queens organization, and New York organization. 01:03:56 – 01:04:08 Metadata ",

He based his impression of the United States on the news which only dictated the worst part of the country. He says that his idea of the United States was wrong because he thought it would be more dangerous. 00:11:13 Wilson discusses the numerous ethnicities that live in his neighborhood and how this effected his life as an immigrant in the United States. He basis his answer on the level of education of immigrants and how this effects there social standing. He discusses the fact that Queens is more diverse than other parts of New York City. 00:15:58 Wilson discusses the difference in English that he learned in Ecuador with the English spoke in NYC.

He talks about a nearby park and how people of the neighborhood would play volleyball in the park. 00:25:30 He discusses the importance of maintaining the cultural presence of Ecuador and of Latin American culture. Although it is important to keep your own culture, living here is a chance to see other cultures and languages. He also discusses the way his culture has been lost here and how traditional dress has been dropped in preference for American style clothing. 00:33:12 Wilson discusses the various reasons why life in the United States is different from life in Ecuador. His mains points are on family life and traditions. 00:38:33 He discusses the issues that could be fixed within the neighborhood, specifically the high rise in rent. He believes that the local government should stop rent raises and maintain a better neighborhood. 00:39:40 He discusses his primary fears of living in Ridgewood. He states that his primary fear is that of security, and being able to commute to work and family more effectively. 00:43:48 Wilson discusses the differences between working and living in Queens than Manhattan. He discusses the rate of pay and why the majority of people prefer Manhattan, rather than Queens. He also discusses the distance that influences people to commute to Manhattan. 00:45:52 Wilson is asked if it is difficult for immigrants that recently arrive in the United States would face a harder time getting a good job. He feels that people have the decision to improve their living and bettering themselves while in the United States. 00:47:55 He discusses how Ridgewood as a neighborhood is able to help in the improvement of immigrants.

He has an emphasis on the fact that all Americans are immigrants. 00:54:49 He discusses that there are two Americas, one that elected the president and the other who wants the best for their country and the world. He speaks about small groups joining together but do not unite with other groups in a mass movement for change. He feels that that difference is the biggest obstacle for unity. 00:56:00 He says that the political situation has not changed his view points and goals in life. He knows he should be more careful about what he says and what he does, but that Trump will not prevent him from living his life and becoming fruitful. 00:59:22 He ends the interview with a description of how he feels about living in the United States and in Ecuador. He discusses his thoughts about immigrants and how they view the United States as a way to improve themselves and grow as a person.

Matthew Lisbon (ML): My name is Matthew Lisbon and I live in Brooklyn. Artie Sanchez (AS): My name is Artie Sanchez, I live in Astoria Houses. John Acevedo (JA): My name is John Acevedo and I live in Brooklyn. Dashawn Johnson: My name is Dashawn Johnson, I�m from Astoria Houses. Efia Lewis (EL): My name is Efia Lewis; I�m from Baldwin, Long Island. DW: This is REELization Films. That�s our group, that�s what it�s called. We work on films, baseball, and everyday life time; sometimes we just make things up. JA: Right now we�re trying to do a re-make of the 12 angry men film. DW: �Twelve Angry People�, since there are females in this group. AS: The neighborhood is good. Everybody gets to know each other. But the bad thing about it is that there are always problems here and there. We tend to see it as normal. Say, I think it was last week, or two weeks ago. There were shootings from Friday all the way to the next week. And everyone here was walking around like it was normal. But anyone who wasn�t from here was like, you know, a little jittery. You know. It was people who live here. And it was funny because the whole thing was, I think it was two groups of people who all grew up with each other, who all know each other, who were friends. But they just split up into two groups. They were still friends, but I don�t know, stuff happens. Then today I was walking along here with my cousin [JA], and there was this girl pulling another girl�s hair, just holding her down. And everyone was walking like it was normal. And we were watching it while we were walking, because it seemed like they were just playing around. A lot of people around here play like that, so�So she was just holding her down and we walked away. But I don�t know what happened after that. JA: What I saw is when I was walking, she looked at us and she was smacking the other one on the head. And everyone was walking by like it was normal. AS: It is normal. Everyone�s grown up like that. People round here slap-box and things like that. Some people don�t know how to take it and then they start fighting. But it�s like a normal thing for people who live around here. After a couple of days [from when the shootings began] there were still no cops. Then after that the whole place was filled - like cops everywhere. But they waited till the second or third day; with the second and third shootings�it felt a little safer with them here because they were everywhere. But now they are gone again. They have the machines out there for the generators in the middle courts but that doesn�t change anything. DW: I�m in high school just trying to go to college so I can study film. ML: Still in high school. AS: Second year at La Guardia Community College. I�m studying human services and mental health and I�m going to go into psychology. Ever since I was young I like the way people behave. I was very observant. So I base my ideas on the way that people act. It interests me to see the way that people form the way they do. JA: I�m in school at the moment in a JD program; I�m going for a certification in computer and computer repair. DL: Still in high school. About seven months still to go. DJ: Still in high school, where I�m on the baseball team. I�m going to go to college and take computer technology course, for computer programming. EL: I go to Queens College. This is my fourth year. I�m studying urban studies, biology and with a business minor. I�m more into public health. I remember someone said how outsiders were freaked out by what happened with the shooting and things. But since I live in Long Island, I�m in an area that�s completely quiet. I grew up in Brooklyn so it wasn�t that much a surprise to me, but I guess living in Long Island I guess it changed my perspective on it � now I can see it�s possible not to live in an environment where you see that as the norm. It is actually possible to live in an area where you barely see police. Ethnicity in Long Island is very different; there are a lot of very stereotypical points when it comes to that. When we first got to Long Island we were the first African American family on my block. And I guess that kind of like changed everything. Once they saw that more African Americans were coming into the environment like the whole perspective on the neighborhood changed - from �this is a great town in Long Island�, to �oh, the schools are getting bad��So it�s just like, the whole racial point of view changes the whole perspective on a town or an area that you live in. I always opposed that. I knew exactly why they were saying it was getting worse than before, it�s how society works. JA: I come over to visit my cousin [AS in Astoria Houses] a lot. But since I�m not from here - I�m from Brooklyn and when I come to Queens there�s a lot of different things. This community is a lot more quiet, it�s quiet compared to certain parts where I live. I don�t see a lot of violence here. Where I live, I see violence every other day, and I would expect that more over here, because it�s a big community. And there�s a lot of projects and a lot of kids looking for trouble. And I wouldn�t expect it so much where I live but I see it all the time and I don�t know why. I guess people just don�t have self-control, there�s people just hanging around outside, trying to start a fight. You don�t see that here. Everybody�s cool with each other, everybody knows each other, and that�s it. AS: I moved here when I was six or seven, from Brooklyn. Right off the back after the first year, all the other kids that grew up, there�s now a new generation that�s grown up. DW: I think its good [the gentrification etc.]. I actually grew up in this neighborhood and then we moved to Ravenswood. When I was first living here, we didn�t see any of that. Like there wasn�t any garden [Two Coves Community Garden]. There was no art [Welling Court Mural Project]. It was totally different. From when I was living here to when I came back when I started this program I saw how everything has changed, like the stores, everywhere. JA: I wouldn�t like to stay in New York because I�ve lived here for so long. I would like to see how it feels to be in a different neighborhood, a different state. That�s what people normally say when they own a house and all they see is like open space and roads etc., they would like to see the city. I would like to switch it up, and go out of state, and see all the open road and land and stuff like that. DW: I would like to stay in New York. Actually my grandparents live in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I visit them often. And it�s so boring out there! It�s very quiet, and there are no street lights, and when you�re driving at night you can�t see anything. And there�s nothing to do. I ask my grandfather �what can you do here?� And he just says �watch the grass grow�! In the future I would like to live in Manhattan. Probably in a penthouse! EL: I love New York. It�s so diversified and stuff. I don�t think any other state can top this. I guess I now miss the city because I�m in Long Island and it�s so quiet. But in the city there�s always something happening, the subway, like� JA: The city�s always alive. But sometimes when I�m in the center of Manhattan I go crazy, because you don�t know what to expect. It�s like everybody�s in a rush, everybody�s doing so many different things, you see so many lights, it�s like do I want to do this, do I want to do that, you see something happening over there, you pay attention to that then something�s happening over here and at night a lot of different things are happening, you get confused sometimes, that�s the way I feel sometimes when you�re in the middle of Manhattan and it�s at night and you can�t stay focused on something. DW: One thing I love is when you�re in the subway, and everything is like kind of dirty and broke down, but as soon as you walk upstairs and see the city, especially at night, you see all the nights and everything it�s like a big change, it like opens up your eyes.

  "Sanchez_Miguel_timecode.txt": "Miguel Sanchez lives in Woodside, Queens. He is an Ecuadorian illegal alien and this is not his real name. He had come to this country because his girlfriend came first and he wanted to join her. He traveled in a fisherman boat from Ecuador to Guatemala, then to Mexico and after, crossing the desert, to the United States of America. The trip was tougher and longer. In New York he could not get back with his girlfriend because nothing was the same. Here he lives with his siblings since the beginning. Miguel’s story is an exemplar path in which immigrants are searching the American Dream although he did not want it initially, and it is too a sample of how is his way of life in this country to which he had never thought to come because he did not need to come. 00.00.33 Miguel Sanchez is from Azogues, Cuenca, Ecuador. When he was 17 years old, he had a girlfriend that decided to come into the United States and that motivated him to come in also (it was the year of 2005). Thus, two weeks after she traveled, Miguel followed her. Frist, he got the money from his siblings who were already living here. They also looked for a \"contact\" (coyote) so Miguel traveled with this contact… In two weeks the required documentation was list and also the money. He was ready for the trip. Miguel did not know in that time what type of city was New York... The trip lasted three months. From his home town he went to Guayaquil and there he boarded a fishing boat that took him to Guatemala in eight days. The boat was small and very uncomfortable, and many anxious people were in it, people who also wanted to reach the United States… The boat was freshly painted. Fresh paint with strong smell of fish were horrible... Soon, after departure, a tank of gas of the part of the \"kitchen\" exploded. People became so much afraid: many cried, others shouted and some became sick. Miguel himself was bad for two days and, since then, he pretended to be sick for sleeping with the crew, at the top of the boat because, that place, was more comfortable... He had never experienced all that, because he was from a very small town called Monjas (\"Nuns\") which was located far from the city. In Monjas all the settlers knew among themselves and they all were like family... Miguel not only was surprised of what he saw in the trip, but also of what he heard and the stories that the people told him. 00:04:46 In Guatemala Miguel was two weeks before he directed to the border and walk two days in a desert to get Mexico. From the Mexican border a trailer took him to Puebla. But in the travel the trailer was overturned, and that would have been the end for Miguel: The trailer was going at high speed, when bending a curve somewhat passed, it slipped and was embedded in a stone. Miguel says that if the trailer had turned over, it had gone straight to an abyss that was straight ahead. He believes that he saved his life due to a miracle and he thanks God because no one suffered serious wounds, but a person that had the arm crossed by a stick... After three months he arrived to New York, being the month of February. Weather was very cold and was snowing, but everything was quiet. That was the city where he came and until that moment he never imagined how was going to live. 00: 07:19 From Puebla Miguel came to the USA border, it was perhaps Texas or Arizona (he seems to recall that it was Arizona) and after he was taken to Los Angeles... He crossed the desert in five days and five nights. Each of the people that were crossing it with him, wore a bag of plastic for metering in it during the cold nights, it was supposed that there they had to sleep in it, but inside the bag they were sweating, they wetted and felt colder. Everyone got up at midnight with the purpose of jogging for warming up a little... There was no food there. Miguel did not worry for that because he didn't feel hungry, but there were people who wanted to eat and they informed it to the contact or coyote, demanding him for food. Miguel only wanted to get to a hot place where he would not feel fear that immigration could arrive at any moment... In Los Angeles he was two weeks, then a coyote gave him a credential and an airplane ticket to New York. 00: 09:39 In New York airport three of his siblings were waiting for him and they took him home. Three days passed and one of his brothers went to play soccer, Miguel also went, but he hurt a knee playing. Miguel was hospitalized for two days. When he returned to their siblings’ house, the pain of the knee was so strong that it was plastered. After a week he had the foot extremely swollen. A brother led him to a person that knew of bones and he was healed. Three months took the healing process, during that time he did not work and his siblings helped him in all. 00:11:20 When Miguel found a job, at that moment he began to give money that his siblings gave him for coming (almost twenty thousand dollars), plus money for food and rent. Miguel restricted so much in expenses and he was working in two different places at the same time. In his free day he washed his clothes and he remained at home. 00:12:20 During two years Miguel was paying the debt until he ended it up, then he started to buy what he needed, as clothing, and began taking English classes in two places. Miguel knew a lot of people there: good and bad ones, the last ones led him by the wrong road, but he knew how to be out of it, if he would not do it he would be now in any gang or perhaps in jail. The good ones still continue being his friends. 00:13:30 People who were at school together with him, went there only for conquering women and taking them to their homes. They also had vices like playing pool, taking liquor on weekends, going to parties and using drugs. He never did anything like that... His friends also had tattoos, put earrings, and pressured him to do the same, so he had an earring under his lips, but he lasted using it only one week because he didn't like it and he felt embarrassed to get home like that... His brothers have never been part of a gang, they did not have tattoos and they have not gotten into negative activities. For Miguel those were gone moments. 00: 15:20 Miguel says that he has his life -or his fate-, under control now. He says that nobody can manipulate him to do something that he does not want to only for being part of a group or center of attention. He recognizes that life in New York has changed him very much… He arrived to this city when he was 18 years and now he is almost thirty. In those twelve years he has too much learned in relation to live alone, being responsible, searching and fighting for what he wants… Miguel says that he always has the forehead high, he thinks that only with effort and work he can improve. If Miguel would stay in his house saying himself: you want money, a car and phone, but if he does not come out to work, then he can get nothing of what he has proposed... There are people who live in a negative way, saying that there is no work because they are perhaps very comfortable, they want easy things who come to their hands or touch them at the door (\"I don't like to say that they are idle\"), but he says that that has not happened to him, in all his life here he has never been without work, he has always worked... Miguel has gone through five works, in one he lasted almost five years, on the other lasted four years and he has always been good and has done the best that he could in them... Although, perhaps, they do not gave him all what Miguel wanted, but instead he gave them all what he could and he has always been responsible for what he has been doing. 00:18:20 Miguel has always liked to be inquisitive... When a co-worker knew he was going to English classes, this friend advised him to take GED. He did not know what it was, his mate explained to him this and led Miguel to the center where he could get GED. Thus, in 2009, the two guys began to study. His friend could not continue studying because he had familiar problems, but Miguel took GED. He had only studied primary in his native country. GED is equivalent of high school and he had to learn everything because he knew nothing. It took time, but it was worth... In GED he met a teacher who was very good (the students called him \"El Ortiz\"), he was Dominican, and a very good teacher, he gave him support and said to him that \"education takes very far and makes him more responsible in all, and (…) you can remove everything from your life less education (what we have in mind).\" The master gave him self-esteem books and novels. Since then Miguel was fascinated with novels. That teacher taught him to move always forward, to set himself goals and to do what he has proposed. 00:22:38 Miguel wanted to go to College, then he worked hard for that and got it, although his first attempts failed due to his poor knowledge of English, but he was recommended an 8 am to 12 pm daily intensive program only for English... He says that he has never been conformist, he always dedicated himself all what could to be one of the best. He was studying English two semesters, then he began College. It was good. Those were times of very little sleeping, but now he can view the results and realize that it was all worth. Miguel always spent his time on something useful... He completed two years at College and has an Associate in English and Literature. Now he studies journalism, lacking a year and a half to complete it. He is not complaining about English now because he can write and read it well, but there are still some things that he does not understand and has to look up its meaning on a dictionary or on Google, but this time English is more quiet and soft, he can already read, analyze and criticize. All what he studied has been useful for him. 00:27:01 Miguel feels himself a different person now, he says that \"one learns with age\", because experiences are accumulating, and one is knowing different points of view. If he had not undertaken the road in which he is now, he thinks that things would be different: \"while one ignores what is happening, one is comfortable, but if we know what happens around us, one begins to ask questions, and to see other people critically.\" Miguel says that companions of school or work can criticize or influence him in different ways. He states that education is important and challenging (although \"sometimes it's better not knowing\"). He is busy all the time, he almost does not have free days and he sees his brothers or family members lying on bed or watching TV. Miguel dedicated free days to do his homework, to go to school, to meet with people. He is always trying to be productive... Sometimes he envies his brothers, and he would like to be like them, but that is only when he has bad days, the rest of the time \"I'm always happy and thank God to be able to work and study.\" Now he is focused on being a Journalist and finishing his studies. 00:30:53 Miguel encountered very difficult to study in College and, after, at the University by the competition that exists in them. He considers that \"is more difficult when you have English as second language by the fear that someone may laugh if you pronounced wrong any word, or one could inhibit by the Spanish accent.\" He says that that were more at College because now things were different for him: \"now it doesn't interest me what people think of me.\" He believes that the most important thing for him is to think, to understand and to assimilate things he is living or studying. 00:32:40 Miguel, here in New York, had no feared of being deported because \"I've always been cautious, I have always been on good terms with everyone, I've never been going to pubs on weekends, to be drunk or smoking.\" And \"until now I does not have fear\" while Donald Trump is President because what can he do to him? \"I am paying my taxes, I am not living free here.\" He says that if one takes into account that he has contributed to the national economy, it will be fine, if not, it would be the same. \"I have never been arrested, police never stopped me. I am not afraid of being deported”, \"If I am deported, I will say 'thank you' because I have a free return to my country.\" 00:34:40 Miguel lives in Woodside. The neighborhood is quiet: \"when I arrived, twelve years ago, it had much Latino.\" At that time there was a pub where were many gangs made problems.\" One night they killed two people and the pub was shut down. Police guarded all that sector, but not because it was bad… of course \"weekends you could not walk freely.\" He says that when he came, the district was already calm. Sometimes he get in to his house at 1 am (from work) and others at 4 am (when goes with his friends for a beer), and it has never happened anything bad to him. Now white people and Chinese are coming, there are many constructions, it is expanding the Middle School because the number of children has increased considerably and, if there is no room there, they would have to go to Jackson Heights or Astoria. \"The place, overall, is developing well and you are safe, there are no problems.\" 00:37:02 Miguel says that Queens is not a bad place for living, it all depends where are you going, whom is going with you and where you are because not all places are the same. \"In fact, Queens is quiet. Sometimes I come to Roosevelt and I think I am in Azogues, Ecuador.\" He believes that if one is bad, people is also going to be bad with one, but if is one is walking quiet, if makes nothing to anybody, then there is nothing to fear of. “It is true that there are provocateurs, there are dangerous people”, but \"I don't think that Queens is dangerous.\" 00:38:33 Miguel says that immigrants are here because \"we want to be better, to give the best for our family and to be responsible.\" Many negative things it is saying now about immigrants: \"that we take away jobs, we are bad people, we bring in bad influences to the United States. Of course, there are god and bad people, but I think that there are more honest people that works hard, that want to improve and do not want to give to their children the life that they had, but a better life (for example, my brother).\" Miguel says that he knows cases in which people have been here for 15 or 20 years and they have not returned to their country and they did not return because they want the best for their children. Miguel says that, unfortunately, to fulfill their dreams, some of them never return home, never come to see their families, \"they return only in their coffins.\" Young people also come here with the goal of improving themselves, for helping their families, \"for example, young like me\" who wants to improve and to get a family one day and to be able to give them the best. \"I would work hard to give a good life to my children, to my family.\" 00:41:40 Miguel says that immigrants are more united, that they are like a family. He says that everyone wants to have their own family, supports them and gets the company of some girl that does not care if you have money or if you live in a luxurious place. Immigrant \"whenever we are, we help and support each other.\" 00:42:14 Miguel says that immigrants that have worked with him, they have been always good workers, \"of course, there are some to whom do not care about their work, who are not responsible, that are lazy and call the boss frequently saying that they are sick, they leave weekends and do not go back to work the following day.\" He thinks that they have chosen the easy life, that they do not know what they want. He says that when you're young you don't matter responsibility, and at the end consequences come: \"there are some who are still in High School and they already have children.\" They are not prepared and they bring to life human beings to whom they don't know if they will maintain them. In immigrant world there are all kind of people, \"it all depends on from where they come in, who they are with and who they join together with.\" 00:44:45 Miguel says that it may be Latin Americans are not supportive and united, \"we are not like Bangladeshi people which are attached: they join together in groups of five or six and have a quote of $500 every month, then they put that money into a bank with the name of all of them, and after four or five years, when they have a big capital, open a business for one of them, and they do it until everyone has their own business.\" Hispanics are not equal, maybe they are united within the family, but does not rely on other people. \"I think that we do not trust in each other, perhaps because before we have been played badly.\" Now Miguel recounts us the case of a person that he knew: that person did not buy clothes, did not drink a beer (or bought cheaper beers and took them to his house), while all the money that he earned he sent to Ecuador. Then, the time came when he wanted to go to the Ecuador because, according to his calculations, he already had enough money, money that he had sent on behalf of his brother and his mom, \"he called and asked them how much money he had and they said that there was no money: the same brother told him that he had never sent money.\" Miguel points out that this is an example of the reasons by which arises the suspicion among Spanish immigrants. \"If that happens between brothers, now imagine you how he could rely on someone that is known just a year: one cannot know to a person in a year.\" Everybody shows a face when is seeking favors and... Chinese says that we have three faces: the good one, the one that we are performing and the real face. There is no confidence: Latinos distrust among us. But in my family all goes well: I've lent money to my brother and he has returned it to me, just as my brothers have given me money and I have returned it. \"We do not have saved together to put a business, but I think that we could do it, we have not still arrived to that point, but we trust among us.\" Miguel says that when Latin American speaks of money everybody begins to shy away: \"money separates us and also many other things.\" He says that he knows of a person that wanted to buy a house in Ecuador and was sending money with that end, his wife bought the house and then she went to live in it with her lover, and \"the man that was here, that worked all his life for saving the money, he remained without nothing.\" 00: 51.27 Miguel says has not always happened good things to him: \"I think that things pass because one wants to.\" The circumstances create that one thing happens, he does not think that things come by itself alone. He says that, yes, sometimes he have had bad moments and he was perhaps irresponsible or didn't do things right. Once he was ran out of the job: “I was there five years and in the first four years I gave everything I could, but when one is stable becomes comfortable and that is bad. When I didn't want to go to work, I called the boss, not always but I did it: one year I did it three times and the last time I was not accepted and I was ran out because I was irresponsible.” That day, instead of going to the work, he went to a party. \"I thought that the work was mine (…) that was by pride, I thought that as I had much time working there I could do what I wanted, and then they give me a kick by my back…\" Miguel manifest that in a love relationship things are equal: he has a spouse and he feels comfortable, not takes her to eat or not brings her flowers, not says her words that she likes to listen, \"after that, the relationship is finished, the confidence will not be the same.\" He adds that it can happen in business because if a person is not aware that employees can steal, business is going down, sinks, and he thinks that the best employee can do it. Miguel thinks that if you feel good, comfortable and not act positively on the job, in a relationship, in a business that is negative: \"if one does not already put more interest, things are collapsing.\" And that is what you deserve in a job if you are an irresponsible... 00:56:50 Miguel says very clearly: \"I believe that romance only occurs when you have money, have a car, live in a penthouse: this is now the new romance.\" He thinks that romance, speaking of the feeling that you can inspire to the heart, it does not exist, at least not in this society, but perhaps it could exist in others places where the people is not so influenced by technology. People say that they fall in love, but Miguel thinks that they are only “looking for benefit.\" So when there is no benefit things are no longer the same. The romance that exists here, he hasn't found to be like is in his native town. He has never felt in love here. “I came here following my girlfriend, I was that time in love and she was all for me, she was my first love.” In this country he has have some girlfriends, \"I came out with many girls (…) but nothing similar to that: now all is just by benefit.\" He thinks that \"girls are now only seeking for someone who brings a truck, dresses well, has a good job and can give them what they want.\" He says that in our times Valentine day has become a simple business, that day is no longer romantic. \"Now, while the gift is bigger more you are loved.\" 01:00:57 Miguel says that his girlfriend came in to this country with one coyote and he came with another one, and they found here in New York, but things were not already as before. His girlfriend was one year younger than him and she came with her parents who took her to the High School. In Ecuador she was living in the same neighborhood as him, but here, in this city, she met other environment, her life changed as well her way of thinking and she knew more people, \"perhaps too many guys.\" When she and Miguel tried to start dating here, it was not the same and her parents were against him: her father always hated him, her father did not want that someone of the neighborhood where they had lived in Ecuador were his daughter’s consort. \"She is now married to a Guatemalan man, and they have a daughter.” He does not know much of her life, but occasionally, when he goes to any folk town party, there is she and her husband there, and “as we are of the same neighborhood, there are always people that know her life and they tells me.” 01:02:39 People from Miguel’s district of origin meet from time to time because they celebrate traditional holidays of their place of origin. In each district there is a sacred image that they held every year and here people encounter to celebrate a party. Miguel’s people are very religious and pass holidays well although town is rather small, but in the parties are food, drink and dance... Here in folk parties, food is the same that in native people: boiled and fried chicken, baked pork, corn, cheese, potatoes and salad. In this country, festivities cannot ate guinea pig as in Ecuador because it cannot be brought often, of course that where Miguel lived the guinea pig was a typical dish for the most important events (confirmation, first communion, christening, marriage). 01:04:57 Miguel emphasizes that there are many Ecuadorian people that do not want to return at home town because they have lived here so long and have formed a family. Of course that he has known people that have returned but they did not accustom and got back to this country, borrowing money to do so. Miguel tells us that when one lives here, works and earns money, those are already a custom, returning to his own country after that and did not find the same thing it is a big problem. He says that when he goes to his country, he will return with a visa or he will go to another country, but \"already I will not follow the road that take illegals for coming, not because I have fear, but because I would like to do something more direct, less complicated, because coming by the road that I took before is too hard.\" 01:06:34 Miguel points out that now he has one European girlfriend and perhaps he will go to her country. They are writing between them frequently. They have already known themselves for almost six years and relationship is going well: \"I feel myself more connected with her, as far as I have been with any girl in this country.\" He has confidence, and something says him that that person herself is worthy. “I've always gone with my instincts and my instincts tell me now that this is a good thing.\" Miguel does not fear a fiasco now. He says that he cannot have a fiasco because he is not a little boy, a teenager, because \"I am already going to be thirty years old and I can take a fiasco more maturely.\" He thinks that all things happen by some reason, and that if anything has to happen, then it will not be a problem for him. 01:08:22 Miguel says that in Ecuador he had a very good way of living (talking economically), and had much freedom. He was the only man in the family there because all his siblings were in this country. They \"wanted that I stayed there, and they sent money.\" Miguel had enough money for going out for a walk, buying things and a brother bought a car that Miguel was driving and took his parents for a walk around the city, and he also used it to get out with his friends. He was a teenager then, at that age \"one wants to go out, to have fun and does not think in anything else.\" That is what he did. Miguel had a girlfriend who loved very much, and he had his sibling’s money. He was missing nothing. He points out that his girlfriend motivated him for coming to this country and the change was very hard for him: that is the kind of things that “one can do for love.\" But if he would have to live all that now, with all the experience he has, he would ask her: for what reason is she going to another country? If her parents want to carry her out, well he would say that they needed to go together because first “we are going to marry us\", he would say her that they are going to start a business, that “we are going to live together\", that he wants to expend his whole life with her, he would want a family and then \"everything would be very different”, but at the time when he was fully in love, “I don't know what I was thinking, the only thing I wanted was to be with her”, and that is for him true love. 01:11:50 Miguel emphasizes that \"I'd like to return to my country, but now I am studying, I want to surpass myself, I will stay two more years until I finish my studies. I have a bit of money saved (...) I have my own house in Ecuador, then I have where to live there: now life would be better for me, smooth, I could find a better job, perhaps I could do something with my studies.\" He points out that right now he could go, but he has nothing yet, he has not any proof that he was at the University: two years is nothing there, but with over four years, with a Bachelor's degree, it would be different... \"If I want to be a journalist in Ecuador, I have to finish a course of six months there” and only with that he can be what he wants. In Ecuador \"I must learn the new system and how working there and follow its rules.\" 01:13:25 Miguel says that \"here there is much competition, although I think that that is good.\" He manifests that here there are many Latinos that can help if you want to do good things… \"It could be as this interview: someone talks to me about his life and that is then published in a newspaper, he could tell the reasons why he is here or why he did not return to his country.\" 01:14:34 Miguel points out that \"in life there are always risks that we cannot escape. Life is not easy.” He says that we always have to follow what life deserve to us, we need to continue fighting and not let that the time pass over. Life and problems are always going to be there and it all depends of us how we are going to see life or how we will overcome problems that life present us. “One must be increasingly better all the time, and we cannot expect that anyone comes and changes our life, one should go outside and change our lives ourselves. And if you can make a positive path is better, it is better if you are immigrant, and you give a good example to people or to other immigrants (...) we are all equal, no matter who we are or where you come from, we must support each other.\" ",
  "Sanclementi_Carlos_timecode.txt": "My name is Carlos Sanclementi. I am the owner of this place [Astoria Billiards]. I bought it in 2004, that�s to say about seven years ago. For 25 years I worked in an American import and export company. When I left, I took some vacation then bought this place. Twenty-five years I was there. I was the supervisor of one of the departments. It was a relative of my wife, he was the owner here. He had got a bit tired and didn�t want to carry on. So he said, �Carlos, how about you buy the business from me,� and I said, �Sure.� My wife agreed. I�m from Cali in Colombia. I came to the states in �66. I don�t go back to Colombia much because now I don�t have many relatives there. But I�m thinking of making a trip because I have a few properties, a few houses there. There�s an agency that looks after them, and given it�s now eight years since I�ve been I want to see how they are. I want to see if everything they say they are doing in their letters, they are really doing! The best thing about working here is that no-one is managing me. I manage myself. I make the decisions myself � and my wife as well of course because we work together. It�s much better than when I worked for 25 years hearing �Carlos, can you do this for me, Carlos, you have to do that.� This guy [standing nearby] is waiting for me so I can play a game of billiards with him. Whenever the clients come and there�s no-one for them to play with, they play with me. Because if not, they wouldn�t come back! My wife is always there working behind the bar and I am in the office � I don�t know anything about what she does, and nor she about what I do. We open at two in the afternoon and never know when we�re going to close. If there are five tables playing at two in the morning, I can�t go and tell them to leave � because they wouldn�t come back. We have two shifts, one from two to ten pm and one from then till we close. One of my wife�s sisters and a friend come to do the night shifts. For the most part the clients are American and Mexicans as well. And yes, there are some who come every day - every day to play. ",

  "Schnurr_Elinor_timecode.txt": "Jazmine: Good Afternoon, This is Jazmine Perdomo. I am going to be interviewing Elinore Schnurr here at the Diego Salazar Art Studios in Hunters Point Section of Long Island City, Queens. All right, how are you today? Elinore: I'm just fine. Jazmine: Good, all right let us begin. All right, so tell me about your first memory that you have? Elinore: Well the first memory I have that I can really remember was when I was probably around 3 years old and how I use to love to draw with my father on the kitchen floor. It was during the depression and everything was scarce but there was a relative who worked at a factory that made paper tablets for a company and he use to bring them over to our house, so we had lots of paper and pencils to draw. So that was always great fun. My father loved to do that. Jazmine: Okay, so what was it like growing up in Ohio? Elinore: It was very pleasant. There were always friends around and relatives. I had a brother at the time when I was small; my sister was born when I was 10. So she was young. We walked to school back and forth everyday for 12 years with my friends. There were lots of activities, you know basketball, football games, I was a cheerleader and rather extroverted and we rode our bicycles and we played in the street and I had lots of cousins, relatives. My father had a sister around and my mother had a family around and they all lived within the six blocks of us. So it was lovely, but I never wanted to stay there forever. So that was just a part of my life. Jazmine: And what part of Ohio was this? Elinore: This was Sandusky, Ohio, which is half way between Cleveland and Toledo on Lake Erie. Jazmine: So what was your relationship like with your parents? Elinore: Generally comfortable. My father took a great interest in us kids. He liked to play games. He liked to play baseball in the street with us. He was always taking us and lots of my friends swimming in the summer time when we wanted to go and he encouraged my artwork always. He himself was something of a jazz musician. Before he married my mother he played in Cleveland in a Jazz band but she made him quit because she didn't like him out on Saturday night. My mother came from a Croatian background, and she had a mother who never smiled and she was a very beautiful but not a happy person. She did not think that anything having to do with the arts was terribly important, sort of a waste of a life when I could've actually done whatever I wanted to do. But she herself was a craftsman, she can embroider, she can sew beautifully, she designed her clothes and she made clothes and crochet hats and sweaters and dresses for every kid in the neighborhood to keep herself busy. But she was frustrated that this was the time when women didn't work and weren't educated and she was smart, she could've done a lot of things and she knew it and she was frustrated by that. Jazmine: So, what was your relationship like with your siblings? Elinore: Well, I was about 10 or 11 years old and I came home one day and I saw my mother cutting flannel squares on the kitchen tables and those were the diapers for my new sister who was about to be born and I was so happy and she was always like my child when she was growing up and we were friends forever in life and she is no longer with me unfortunately. I had a brother who was two years younger than myself and a little more remote. We use to be kind of a same physical strength cause I was 2 years older and he was a boy and we use tonight a lot and my mother use to push us out the door to fight. But we loved each other, yeah very good. Jazmine: Can you just remind our listeners what years you lived in Ohio? Elinore: I was born in 1932 and I eventually went to the Cleveland Institute of Art. I left Ohio in 1955. Jazmine: So what made you leave Ohio? Elinore: I had fallen in love with a man who had been at the art school when I was there but had moved to New York to finish his education at Pratt. So, when I finished art school I moved to New York and we very quickly got married and we moved to Providence for a couple of years and then we traveled in Europe for six months. We had saved up some money because I was doing fabric design at the time and just went all around looking at paintings for six months and didn't do anything else. Saw all the great work in Europe and there were not very many travelers and it was very cheap so it was a great, great thing to do. And when we came back he's continued to work in Providence at the Gorham Silver Company for a couple of years and we decided to go to New York where he had other possibilities. So that's what we did and that was in around 1960. Jazmine: Ok, now what was one of the biggest difficulties when you moved to New York, officially? Elinore: It was mostly, well I was, we were both young so there were we didn't see many difficulties at all and we found a small apartment on the west side in 72nd Street and stayed there for a while until I got pregnant with my first child. And then we found an apartment up near Columbia University that was quite large it was seven rooms and it was very cheap because it was under rent control. So we were there for them, All the while my children grew up. I had a daughter later and the children grew up there. Jazmine: And you have a total of two children? Elinore: I have two children, yes. Jazmine: Do you have a good relationship with them today? Elinore: Yes, fabulous! My son is was a wild kid but he managed to create a contracting business for himself in Long Island City actually. My daughter lives in Manhattan not far from where she grew up. So they stuck around and they both have children. So it's been very nice for me that they're here. Jazmine: So what do you do for a living and what made you decide to take on that. Elinore: Well as I said my mother said I was a little bit that I threw my life away but I decided to make my living making paintings, which I pretty much have done. I just never got into teaching or any of this. The other things that helped to support an artist although I did do proofreading for a large law firm for many years when I was in Long Island City. But those kinds of jobs like proofreading don't pay anymore like they used to. Used to be able to actually make a living at that. And I always did it just part time. So basically, I make my living selling paintings I make and sell paintings period. That's about it. Jazmine: What kind of paintings do you do? Elinore: I've always been a figurative painter, although in summers I have done landscape pure landscape plain air. Which is going out into the field and painting on the spot. But my basic way of painting, My basic painting is figurative painting, Trying to figure out you know people how they feel in a philosophical basis to the painting somewhat related to Edward Hopper who was my original inspiration. And I spent some time, I still do portraits when they come up from people because I can get a likeness and I do enjoy doing portraits and getting a sense of a sense of the presence of another person pretty well and I just finished the portrait. I don't do as many portraits as I used to. I used there was a time when I got myself out of debt by spending a year doing portraits. So that's my story there. Jazmine: So when you first moved here to Long Island City, what was it like? What were the neighborhoods like? Where were the people like? Elinore: Well it wasn't like it is today. I can tell you that right now. When I came to Long Island City I brought a friend with me to take a look because I was scared to cross the river into Long Island City. I mean having been traumatized by this by the situation in New York you know originally. But I had seen an ad in the paper for an apartment live workspace in Long Island City and I had been divorced and was living in other people's lofts for a while. So I decided to pursue this and see. And I ran into Diego Salazar who was just moving his business, he had a business in framing and making frames. So he now wanted to rent his space out to an artist basically. And it looked like a great space. My son was just starting to do contracting building work so he helped me put in the kitchen building to the place. And I lived there for 20 years. There were a lot of our businesses in the neighborhood in live/workspaces at that time. And so I gradually helped to form a group called the Hunter's Point Artists Coalition. Which we had shows from time to time mostly a big spring show with open studios and somebody gave us a big space sometimes to have a show along with it and I love long island city. You couldn't get down to the waterfront at all and there was no park. People were dumping asbestos down there and down by the waterfront. It was a little bit little bit scary to go out at night walk around in the neighborhood. It was mostly industrial. At the time and the sewage plant wasn't built yet. Those pretty smelly here sometimes when the wind blows the wrong way. So it wasn't terribly desirable and therefore the rent was cheap. So here we have another situation where we have cheap rent and not such a great neighborhood and as the neighborhood is gentrified, it's high rent and you can't live here. So but de Blasio has built some affordable apartments in Long Island City and be responsible for some more. So I have one of those so I'm I lucked out just because I've been here for so long. Jazmine: So you mentioned that there was a situation in New York. I believe you said 1980s and how it was dangerous. Can you explain a little bit more about that? Elinore: Well yeah I mean I was knocked down a few times when I entered my apartment building which was near Morningside Park which was near close to Harlem which wasn’t a great neighborhood at the time although it's changed a lot by now. And my one of the kids I was taking to the park got hit with a beer bottle and threw it over the wall from Morningside Park you know those kinds of things. My kids were, well you have to be careful. The bike was stolen once there. You know just different, different things and I was knocked down a few times myself coming in and out of my building and that was the west side. Then there were the marches that from 1968, when my son was 6 years old and my daughter was 4 we were in the middle of the fight against the Vietnam War. This was a hotbed of revolution up there on the Upper West Side. And there was a civil rights movement. And one of the people who was very involved in the civil rights got killed and who lived in my building at the time. There was a big fight over where Bank Street School is now and people died in that fight. That happened a little before, but they were trying to build an old age home where my building was my $110 a month apartment was in this group of buildings. They wanted to knock down 8 buildings and build an old age home right across from St. John the Divine. And we said no way! But there were fortunately a group of tenants who lived in the building just refused, refused to leave. So in some of the buildings there were only three or four apartments that were occupied. And a new bishop, Bishop Moore that's who it was, came in to the church and he was afraid that he was the rose window was going to get smashed or something in the chaos that was happening not only with ourselves which was minor, but we were making use of some of the chaos to keep our buildings and so that we were able to save two of the buildings. I remember what happened. There was a group one night. One night. There was a group of people who moved into the empty building next door to us. They had emptied out six of the buildings and they moved in with plumbers and carpenters and the whole works and occupied the entire building. And then the church gave up and they built their building somewhere else. Jazmine: Wow, so you mentioned that you were part of like a feminism movement. How was that like and around what year if you can remember? Elinore: Well, that what's going on about the same time. I really never participated in it as a group but emotionally I had always grown up to be to consider myself equal to men. And so the feminist movement was just an affirmation of this idea and we became quite strong while I was, while I was developing my work. Because I would and I was aware that there were very few women who were in the big national shows there were very few women who were represented in galleries. And after I had had a painting that was in the Museum of Modern Art there were a few galleries that were interested in seeing my work although it wasn't developed to the point where I was ready to show but so I had a couple of appointments and one in particular when I said that I during the interview that I had a child I was out the door. So, which infuriated me of course. But gradually things have changed and women are an equal part of almost an equal of the art scene. Jazmine: Ok. So are you involved in any volunteer work in and around the city? Elinore: Only involved in volunteer work having to do with the organization that I have been helping to develop. I'm on the board of the LICA organization. LICA stands for Long Island City Artist and is an organization that has existed for 35 years but has taken on a larger role after Plaxo. The Plaxo Company has given us 12,000 square feet of space to work with. So we've become very active in soliciting and bringing in various groups from all over Queens. Art groups and the group that shows everything about it has expanded so as a result, I've been active that is strictly a volunteer project but I don't participate with others. I just don't have time. Jazmine: So what do you want to see in Queen's future? Do you want something to change? Do you want them to make more of something? Elinore: Well I would like to see in Long Island City I would like to see the Plaxo gallery actually follow through when they build they plan to build the complex over there by Annabel Basin. That they actually follow through and give make a community center, which is what they say they will do. And so that it will remain a focal point for the Arts in Queens. It's not just visual art but it's also cultural. It's also performance art as well and has that. So and more involvement as a result with people in terms of the Arts which has been happening on a very slow basis. But by reaching out and if the economy continues to be okay or thrive there will be more. There will be more participation because I've noticed the quality of work that has been coming in from all over Queens has been you know very very very good very good and Queens has never been known as for its for its art. Flushing Council has been one of the few places that's even shown much art and they've kind of backed off since they belong to the Smithsonian now. They don't show much visual art of the artists around in Queens. They tend to do more local things and concentrate on music whereas at an earlier time they had a great, a much larger focus on the visual art. But now it seems like Plaxo has taken over that, that particular thing. Jazmine: How is the community here? Do you guys have annual festivals? Elinore: Yeah yeah. We have a lot. We do have two annual festivals. There's a theater here called the Secret Theater, which is run by a man who has come in from came in from London maybe about 10 years ago his name is Richard Mazda, who is a dynamite person and he has a small theater right around the corner. He decided to participate in the Open Studios festival to recreate it make it bigger about five years ago or so, maybe a little longer. And as a result now we have two festivals one in the spring one in the fall. And there are exhibitions in every possible place some places that are old warehouses over behind LaGuardia. That used to be owned by Macy's and Gimbals’ that have this extra space. They've had this extra space for several years that they give to the artist to use. It used to be in the faulty building but now it's over in the factory building, huge spaces. So Richard has taken it upon himself to bring in art in those spaces. He keeps art in the factory, most of the time. But in the fall there's a festival. It's just about to happen now. And in the spring there's an even bigger festival and art is hung just about any nook and cranny you can find around and it's a good festival. But it's used to be, there were more live workspaces and there are more workspaces and there are more people from other places that come in and use spaces here. They participate. So it's it keeps changing, keeps changing and there's film and there's the, forget the name of the film, there's a field museum do you know that one? Kaufman, Kaufman studios. They have a museum and they have a lot of film festivals, Queen's film festival, Queen's short film festival. So it is actually, actually quite a bit of activity in the area and but it's very most of the people live in Long Island City are here because moved here because they have families because they wanted to have a family. It's really hard to get them off to our festivals and things you know. But, but people do come from wherever. Jazmine: Now before the interview we were talking about how they're building new properties and everything like that. How do you feel about those, the development? Elinore: Well they’re over; they're overdoing it totally. There's a certain amount of pushback from the neighborhood. But the real estate people have all the money and the planning and there's a 79 story building going up about a block from here which is the tallest building in Queens and much too much, too much too tall. And over by the waterfront, there's a part that joins up by the Newtown Creek. It's like a point and they're going to put up three or four more buildings up there. And one of them is a 55-story building and they're talking about covering over part of Sunnyside Yards and putting buildings up on top of it as if there's not enough space to put buildings. But what they haven't done is put in the infrastructure is beginning to be deficient. The waste water, the sewage the water that kind of thing. The transportation is overcrowded now and I don't know what's happening when the L line closes now for repairs. There's a lot of people that are going to be moving into Long Island City because they won't have the, you know the transportation on the L line. So, It's taken a long time to start, to start Long Island City, it took almost 20 years to get it going and now they can't stop it. So but it's interesting they keep the Vernon Avenue part, the Vernon Boulevard I should say Vernon Boulevard continues to have its small shops, mostly restaurants. That's mostly what's there and a whole area that's kind of low level and zoned from this area that I'm in is zoned for small buildings narrow buildings they can't build high buildings here. But right across, a block away they can build. So it is a battle, constant battle between the community board and city itself. Sometimes, we’ll see. The community board will when, when the real estate people run out of money. That is what will happen. Jazmine: Ok. What do you think is the best thing that could happen to this neighborhood? Elinore: Probably to take all these things into consideration. The quality of life into consideration and in the planning you hear things like well the fine art commission of New York, I don’t know what its called, Finkelstein I think the name is, says well we are going to build 35 live/work spaces to keep the artist in Long Island City. Wonderful. But, I don’t know will they do it, will that happen? It seems like there’s constant, what do I want to see. That is not your question. What do I want to see? Well a lot of things that are happening are things I want to see. They’re around a lot more cultural things here, a lot more yoga in here. The park has a, has tangle dancing, has yoga in the summer. It has races. There’s all kinds of wonderful community activities. There are children art classes. Children art schools. There is just a plethora of things that are going on as the number of people in the area rise. But it seems there is a tipping point somehow with the infrastructure that has not been fully taken into account but I don’t know where that is either and nobody really does. And some of the old buildings, Diego keeps this building in really in really tiptop shape but the building next to us, is owned by DF cornerstone and that is only 3 stories and they are just waiting for the zoning to change. But will the zoning change? As soon as the zoning changes, everything goes crazy because there are these people waiting for the zoning. There is a certain amount of planning, but too much planning doesn’t work either. I just I have no idea. I don’t know how people work these things out. It seems to me it just happens. Most of it just seems to happen. Jazmine: When it comes to your artwork, has it ever been in a gallery? Elinore: I have been in the past. Now there is interesting, the galleries the situation for artist has changed a lot since I started. Because when I started, we had slides. We presented slides to people. And there were not that many artist and you can walk into a gallery and how the gallery owned the slides. I can make an appointment with the curator at the museums because they wanted to see my work. You cannot make a person, you know, that’s not the way it works anymore. The Internet happened. The Internet, there use to be a few artists who would go about with things to show. But now there are millions because anybody who picks up a paintbrush can show their work on the Internet. So it really makes sense for a very different, different market there. Then, there are the art fairs, which take a lot of energy with the galleries they show at the art fairs. It cost a lot of money to show at the art fairs. They no longer take on the responsibility promoting individual artist in the same way that they use too. And then so much of the money going into the art auction into the buying and selling paintings, which have no cultural cohesion at all. Its just money and artist don’t benefit from that all. Its just art has become a commodity. They don’t look at the art and say, “oh that’s beautiful, how did you do it?” No, they’ll just say, “oh yeah wonder how much that will be worth in 10 years.” Fortunately, there still are a lot of people who love art. The amount of art that is out there and the amount of art that people buy is probably more than ever. It has become a very large and chaotic enterprise. Jazmine: When you said slides, what is that for someone who doesn’t know what that is? Elinore: Well you take a picture with a 35 mm slide, and then you created a slide for each of your painting and you sent it to a gallery and showed it to a gallery. That was operative until the Internet came along. Jazmine: Have your paintings been in galleries, any recent ones or…? Elinore: Recently I haven’t been showing in galleries. The gallery I was showing in one called Capricorn, down in Bethesda, Maryland and they were very big on figurative art for 40 years and they did very well. I had another gallery in Atlanta, Georgia that did okay. One in Cleveland for a while. Then at one point, I moved into back from Green Point here and someone who had been coming to look at the work and when the arts opened were responsible for commissioning a couple of paintings for lobbies in buildings. I have in the building on the water front here, 45-40. It’s a painting of the interior of Grand Central. The print is up there on the wall, but there is a big painting in the lobby. Then I did one for Four City Ratner in Brooklyn in one of the few buildings they have left now at 85 near Bam. I have a big painting in the lobby and those took a lot of energy and I kind of let the other stuff slide. Then those galleries they aged out and then they were older people who had them and then they went out of business. There was one in California also. At that point, it just seemed so difficult, and couldn’t make contact with the galleries easily anymore. They weren’t opened to seeing new work by an older artist. They weren’t interested. They wanted somebody who was straight out of a MFA program that they could manipulate into big money right away. Anyway that is my take on it. Did you ever hear such a cynical approach? Anyway recently, I have a large mailing list that I have accumulated over the years. And recently I have been making more of an effort to sell with my mailing list and I started listing prices on the Newsletter, which I sent out with a picture and that seems to be working in an interesting way. You know, there is always something new and I have the work. I have lots of work. So it’s a matter of organizing properly. It’s a month-to-month thing. I don’t know very many people who make a living making art. Jazmine: Do you ever collaborate with other artists? Elinore: Not with the actual work. No. Probably in showing it, but not collaborate. I take a great pleasure in being here all by myself and just painting quietly and I can do that for days, days at a time. Jazmine: Do you have an advice for people who want to pursue this? Elinore: Just do it! There are lots and lots of ways to do it. You don’t have to just paint pictures and sell them, you can, as so many [people that I know do, you can work in the commercial market, you can work in the interior decorating market with work, you can form groups. You can show in small groups. There are more and more organizations that one can send ones work for temporary exhibitions, which I do do also as well as sending things personally and that combination seems to work. So that is a way to get the work out as well. It doesn’t really sale out there but people do see it. Jazmine: Where do you go for your inspiration for your paintings? Elinore: Well I had a favorite place, which has disappeared. In the book there, that Matt was looking at, has my what I call my “Reflections” series outside looking in series. I was standing on a corner by the Blue Fin restaurant in times square and that was unusual because that restaurant had a ceiling to sidewalk glass window that faced times square at 46th street. So that when you looking into the window, you saw the people inside and you saw the reflection on the glass of what was behind you of Times Square. I had done endless paintings using those variations on that subject. I like the idea of painting something that is real and not real at the same time. The mystery of that intrigues me. It’s sort of a collage like effect, which I liked. And then I have another series. One painting I just finished has reflections upon reflections, upon reflections and mirrors and you know their glass acts like a mirror and you know it becomes quite abstracted. Because it’s a visual process when you look at something, you don’t see the whole thing like you would see a renaissance painting. You don’t see the whole thing, you see in pieces. I look at you, I see your eyes then I see your mouth then I see your hand. I don’t see all of you. But sometimes when you make a painting you see the whole figure all at once. But I play around with these visual kinds of things. Then I was doing a series and I am still continuing it. I introduce a narrative into what I just described because by looking at these situations in Times Square you have a lot of electronic boards that have images on them and sometimes these boards are mixed up with the people in there. So, instead of using advertising, I used the narrative of an outside world. I’d always had the idea that I wanted to get this duality of the human mind and look at something and you can have something in your mind at the same time, so it could present a visual image. And so I introduced images of terrorism, guns and different things like that into the paintings that I have been doing from the reflections, which I call more of a narrative. A narrative situation. And that is probably the place where I am at. I want to do some more of that although, I find that I don’t have to use terrorism, and nasty things. I can do other things as well. But there is always something out there. But Blue Fin no longer exists on that street and there is no other place like it in Times Square so I am looking around for new situations that inspire me out there. Jazmine: Well I think that is all I have for you today, did you want to add anything else? Elinore: No, I can go on and on, but I won’t. You probably have enough. Jazmine: So, once again this is Jazmine Perdomo interviewing Elinore Schnurr here at the Diego Salazar Art Studios here in the Hunter’s Point Section of Long Island City, Queens on November 3, 2018.

  "Sering_Candice_timecode.txt": "Candice Suree, a Filipino American, was born in Manhattan, New York. Her family moved to Flushing, Queens when she was one years old. In this interview, She talks about what it was like growing up in Queens during the 80’s and what sort of environment she grew up in, as a Filipino American. Moreover, she talks about her academic achievements and provides examples of the reasons that lead her to choose her current occupation. 00:00:37 her earliest memory of Queens is, sliding down the stairs of the house she grew up in. she was born in Manhattan, but the family moved into the big house when she was one years old. The house is located in Flushing and 165th street. 00:03:10 her parents moved to the states because her mother saw it as a great opportunity. 00:03:57 they were the first Asian family to move to Flushing. All of her neighbors were either older Italian or older Irish. The neighborhood was also less populated and quiet. 00:06:09 as a child, she would watch television and try to play games around her household chores. 00:07:30 there were very few kids in her neighborhood. There was a family that had a kid, but they left before she had the chance to play with the child. 00:08:26 all of the siblings attended the same elementary and middle school around the area. Therefore, they would all walk to school together. 00:09:23 she attended PS 21 (147-36 26th Avenue, Queens, NY 11354.). The school was really diverse and consisted of students with different ethnicity. 00:09:56 she had a good experience attending P.s 21. 00:10:49 all of her teacher were white. Her teacher, Ms. Thom was the only Asian teacher in the school. 00:15:35 she was part of the math team during middle school. She and her sister also took piano lessons. 00:17:35 her parents would have her play the piano during family gathering. 00:19:34 the family gathering would also be held at Ergo Park, Cunningham Park, other halls, and other homes. 00:20:28 there were yearly. 00:22:19 she attended Bronx Science in 10th grade. The middle school she attended was from sixth grade to ninth grade. In eighth grade, she applied to Stevensons, Bronx Science, and Brooklyn Tech. She did not make the cut for Stevenson or Bronx Science. However, she did make it to Brooklyn Tech, but in the 80’s no one attended Brooklyn Tech. Thus, she attended ninth grade in her middle school and applied again for tenth grade. She made the cut for Bronx Science and LaGuardia. She really wanted to attend LaGuardia, but her father was against it. Therefore, she ended up attending Bronx Science. 00:24:03 she was really mortified to be going to a science high school or a speacilized high school. Therefore she did a summer program at Bronx Science, in order to ease herself into the school; and was 14 years old, at that time. High school was bad but also good, in terms of her, managing to stay out of trouble. Summer school was just half a day, so she would hang out in Washington Square Park, afterwards; a lot of hangouts would happen. Furthermore, she met her high school boyfriend at that time and they would hang out a lot as well, because they were really serious. They would eat McDonalds and go to all of the museum in Manhattan. 00:27:00 her sixth grade teacher, Ms. Goodman and winning the good picture contest lead her to be interested in art. 00:28:39 her parents wanted her to do the doctors track because she wanted to be a pediatrician when she was really young. 00:31:41 she did not finish her college application so attending the college in Chicago was her only option. She hated it, because it was not diverse at all. 00:33:43 she took some time from school and worked at Barnes and Noble. After semester, she decided to go back to school. She attended Hunter College around mid or to late 90’s. She then, went to the University of Puerto Rico for a year as an exchange student and decided to finish her undergraduate there. 00:38:42 a lot of the people thought she was Puerto Rican. Moreover, a lot of them were curious about her reason for moving to Puerto. 00:40:38her filipnio experience in Queens was a happy time. Queens to her, had a family oriented environment. There were a lot of Filipinos around her and there was space for it. Moreover, she recalls going to the Filipino market with her mother to get groceries. hoewever, she did not think about moving back to Queens after coming back from living abroad for a decade. 00:51:20 she hopes that Queens maintains some of its sense of roots ",
  "Serpe_Lynne_timecode.txt": "My name is Lynne Serpe and we are at Two Coves Community Garden in Astoria. It was once a vacant lot. There was an idea of turning it into a park but then the money dried up. But local people decided that well, if we turn it into a community garden then we don�t need to worry about the money because we maintain it. That was in 2006/7. I got involved in January of 08. At that time we had about 10 or 12 people. At the end of the 08 season we had about 80. And by the end of 09 season we had about 150. And today we have around 250 people gardening. We have 130 individual plots, and then we have a community plot where people garden together, that�s where people garden who may be on the waitlist, or who don�t have the time or energy to maintain an individual plot. Or we bring in groups from schools, from churches. Between the individual plots where you can have1-4 people or even more, and the community plot we have at least 250 people gardening. It�s an incredibly diverse garden. In 2009 when we last counted there were about 40 different languages spoken in the garden. And if you walk around you can kind of guess which plot might belong to let�s say Bangladeshi gardeners, or Caribbean gardeners they have callaloo, choy, things like that. This garden has a lot of sunshine. There are only a few trees that were put in by the parks department when they were thinking of turning it into a park. As a garden, we prefer not to have too many trees, because sooner or later they grown and cast shade, not just on your plot but the person next to you. Also we don�t own our space. We are a Green Thumb licensed community garden, so we get a license through Green Thumb (a division of the Parks Department). People get a plot and become members. They are expected to maintain their plot and renew every year. We also ask people to do a couple of volunteer hours a month, mainly working on the common areas. There�s a suggested donation of $20 for the season. Our plots are at least 100 square feet. When we first started, some of the early gardeners had much larger plots, but as we�ve gotten more and more popular, we passed a rule around 2008 for plot standardization towards approximately 100 square feet. We�re also an odd size. We�re a triangle. So some of the plots might be long and narrow, like six by sixteen � it really varies. We have about 150 people on the wait list. Myself and another gardener are on the plot allocation committee. I just spent this whole first part of the year from March through to a couple of weeks ago taking about 30 people off the wait list. So that will be around another 50-70 people gardening this year because, usually each plot has more than one person using it. During our renewal process it usually means that people have moved, or become too busy. The most common reason is that they have moved. The second most common reason is if they have had a child and are too busy. I planted a blueberry plant this year and have already had some blueberries. I also have strawberries, a lot of herbs so basil, thyme, oregano, lavender, rosemary. I�ve also grown stevia this year for the first time. Four different types of lettuce � red, mizuna, green. I have carrots, eggplant, tomatoes, squash, beans, and a whole bunch of marigold. 100 square feet, you can really pack a lot in there. I am a freelance contractor. My main contract in the area is the Queens library. I run a Greening Libraries Initiative. One of the many parts of that is that we have planted three gardens at libraries in Queens. The Astoria Branch Library on Astoria Blvd. and 14th, the Steinway Library up by Ditmars and the Woodside library over by 55th. The first two have their own courtyard, and at the Woodside Library we�ve partnered with the parks department and it�s a triangle across the way. So volunteers, kids etc. At Astoria the theme is a Shakespeare garden � so everything we�ve planted is mentioned in works of Shakespeare. At Steinway it�s more of a shade garden, because there�s a lot of shade. We�ve planted a lot of root vegetables like carrots, turnips and beets and radishes. Things that don�t necessarily need 8 hours of sun a day. And then Woodside is a butterfly garden, so we chose colorful flowers that would attract lots of butterflies. I first moved here in 1994 and lived at 37th Street and 31st Ave. I�ve come and gone over the years but always pretty much in the 31st Ave, 30th Ave area, and usually in the 30s. Because I�m a contractor, a lot of the time I have jobs in other parts of the country or even in other parts of the world. A lot of my work in the past has been political campaigns [in 2009 Lynne stood as a Green Party candidate for the NY City Council]. And I worked for the New Zealand parliament for a couple of years. So I am with a lot of campaigns and that takes me out of town for six months at a time. Then I come back because I love Astoria. The people are great. I love the food and diversity. Also it has a good balance between the old and new residents. I grew up in Long Island (my parents had grown up in Brooklyn and moved out when they were older) in a family with not a lot of money, so I first came to the gardening/green living thing as a way to deal with limited resources. Then I found that I really enjoyed gardening and getting my hands dirty. I enjoy eating the food that I grow. And here in particular I enjoy the community that I�ve met and the friends that I have made. I also like to feel that I�m contributing to the community. This was an abandoned lot and there were things associated with that. And now it�s this beautiful oasis in the middle of Astoria. It provides a place for hundreds of people to grow their own food, get some exercise and be outside in the sun. The number of kids in the garden�it�s so much fun watching them play and watering - and when they get to pick a fresh strawberry. With my first chance when I graduated from college I moved back to the city. I moved to Astoria. ",
  "Shah_Raja_timecode.txt": "“There is a big problem in New York City right now. There is a little doggie holocaust going on.” Back in college, Raja Shah wanted to develop a theory that would change society. “In my senior year I realized that this wasn’t realistic,” says Raja, who a few years ago returned to Sunnyside, where he was born. Over the years he has worked with the homeless, at literacy centers for children, with kids in gangs and with ex-cons. But it was as a volunteer at an animal shelter that he realized he could follow his calling and still make a living. His behavioral training of dogs that were deemed unadoptable yielded good results, and shelters as well as individuals began to hire him. The Dog Guru was born. In the past Raja had to travel to shelters and foster homes to train dogs rescued by Barc, Stray from the Heart and actress-cum-animal-rescuer Bernadette Peters. But on July 20, 2010 he signed the lease for the old 43rd Street Cinema at Greenpoint Avenue, where he now provides housing and training for 20 of these rescue groups’ most challenging dogs. Once the dogs are socialized they will be put up for adoption. “There is a big problem in New York City right now.” Raja says. “There is a little doggie holocaust going on. If you have 35 dogs being put to sleep 365 days a year, that’s a serious issue.” While he of course loves dogs, his motivation has always been to try to make society a better place. “Until we create a bigger solution,” he says about New York’s large euthanasia numbers, “I’m going to do my best trying to ease that number.” How does he do it? One dog at a time. The day I happened to run into him on the street, he was teaching George, a gigantic German Shepherd, some basic dog commands. He calmly walked around him, whispering commands and stepping over his tail in an attempt to take away George’s fear of being approached from behind. “Aggression is not always the worst problem,” says Raja, whose canine clients are primarily pitbulls. Take, for example, Penny, a three-year-old, 40-pound pitbull. Indoors, Penny just sat head down and moaned, while outside she was terrified. Raja was the last in a line of multiple trainers who had tried their hand on Penny. Penny would stiffen her front legs like a cartoon animal, making Raja drag her down the street. Raja tried to put a strap around her belly and bounce her on her front legs; he tried food motivators—dog treats, hotdogs and hamburgers—but nothing seemed to work. So Raja decided to train “the doggie,” as he lovingly calls his rescues, strong disciplinary skills indoors. Slowly he worked up her confidence and gained her trust. Eventually Penny became so focused on Raja’s commands that she forgot her fear when out on the street. Raja became her main focus. “I had a party that night,” Raja says about this turning point in Penny’s life. But he quickly admits that there have been dogs he had to give up on. While he contributes some behavioral issues in dogs to mental disabilities, he is also humble. “It’s not that they are not savable,” he says in his characteristic soft and low voice. “It’s just that I myself don’t know how to save certain dogs.” ",

  "Sheik_Ata_timecode.txt": "“When you want to come to America, don’t buy a discount ticket or you’ll end up on Skillman Avenue.” 28 years ago, two days after getting his American drivers license, Ata Sheikh almost made a wrong turn from 48th Street onto Skillman Avenue. When he noticed that Skillman Avenue was a one-way street, he turned around. Before turning, though, he spotted an empty store. The next day he happened to see the very same store advertised in the paper and decided to buy it. While his wrong turn had quickly turned into a right, the process of becoming a businessman happened step by step. “I knew nothing about business,” says Sheikh, who lives with his wife and five children in Woodside. “But I automatically started to learn. The customers are the main source to teach business people how to run a business.” Sheikh feels comfortable around his frequent customers, many of whom return several times a week for a cup of coffee, to discuss politics (Sheikh is an avid fan of Hillary Clinton), or simply gossip. He has faced only a few problems as a storeowner. He was robbed twice in the eighties and nineties and occasionally he encounters a “grab and run thief.” “This is a very good area,” Sheikh says with confidence. “For me this is my home.” Originally from Kashmir in Pakistan, Sheikh used to work for an import-export firm in Saudi Arabia. During his month-long vacations he traveled around to see other countries. He has always been the adventurer in his family and is the only one who left Pakistan. Sheikh now rarely visits his home country. “They think I’m the crazy one, who likes to stay alone,” he says about his seven brothers and sisters. “But that’s the way I like it.” While Sheikh and I talk, the lottery machine rings incessantly. 40% of the store’s income derives from lottery tickets and scratch-offs, the rest from soda, beer, snacks and toiletries. Asked to tell a funny story having to do with his store, Sheikh returns to the reason why he ended up on Skillman Avenue. In the podcast he tells this story as his favorite joke. ",

In this interview, Yuan described her involvement in the Chinese community and the church groups she joined as well as her daily life at the Golden Eagle Senior center in Flushing. 00:00:39 Yuan Shi was born in 1937, Hubei Province, China.

She attended a Christian junior high school in Hankou, and later studied at the Peking Union Medical College.

Yuan fell in love with the songs and asked her mother about the song. Her mother told her the song came from this big book and promised to teach Yuan when she grows up, but her mother never told her what it was. Yuan later found out the song was a Christian hymn and the book her mother referred to was the bible. Her mother couldn't tell her back then because religious belief was sensitive in China at that time. 00:10:00 Yuan explains how Christian religion affected mother�s life. Yuan�s mother was a Christian; she was honest, friendly, and hardworking. Her patients and neighbors all loved her. She treated poor patients for free and gifted them medicine. After she gave birth to Yuan�s older brother, she closed her clinic and began taking care of her family because she knew that family is her priority. 00:10:57 Yuan�s impression about her father.

Mingluan�s mother passed away when she was young, her uncle took care of her until junior high school. After that, she began her study at a medical school operated by French. 00:22:00 Yuan�s parents left their family and studied elsewhere, so Yuan�s family relation only has her uncle as her relative. Yuan had clear social relations. Because of that and the fact that Yuan studied physics, she was working with PRC�s national security and scientific research team. She was also involved in multiple research studies related to nuclear explosion-proof structure, monitoring structural strength in craft at sea, conventional explosive reactions in the mountains, etc. 00:27:08 During the Cultural Revolution, those who were landlords, rich farmers, anti-revolutionary, criminals, and right winged influence were not allow to work with national defenses. 00:28:40 Memories with childhood friend George at Tongji University 00:30:30 Yuan and George wanted to choose architecture design as their major, but Yuan�s second older brother Dong Shi stopped them and persuaded them to specialize in bridge with him. 00:33:36 Memories about class fieldwork in Hangzhou with George 00:38:13 Yuan and George liked to sit on the first row in the classroom because it helped them concentrate.

She also had a chance to see the scenery in different states and was also deeply touched by the power of scientific research in America. Yuan also loved the peaceful feeling in America�s countryside. Because her daughter was also studying abroad in New York, she later decided to migrate to the US to join her daughter in 1991. 00:48:57 Yuan visited her daughter who was studying abroad in Albany and the lady who was her daughter�s home stay sponsor. 00:57:14 Yuan went to Hawaii in January 1991 to conclude her research visit. 00:57:45 Yuan met a Ph.D student studying abroad in China from US.

The staff at the church referred Yuan to joined their music team and taught Chinese at the Immanuel church (which shared space with the New York Cho Dae Presbyterian Church located at 210-10 Horace hoarding). Yuan�s granddaughters also came with her to learn Chinese at the church. She later continued her Sunday worship at the church with her friends. 01:22:13 Yuan said that she visited different states in America and that she likes the countryside environment and the friendly people. 01:23:17 Yuan attended computer software, drawing, and art classes at CUNY LaGuadia College. 01:24:00* Yuan is currently a member at the New York Golden Eagle senior center located in Flushing. The senior center provides various recreational and social activities. The center offers different classes throughout the week and members can join the classes that they have interest in. Yuan particularly likes the painting and music classes. The staffs are kind and friendly. The location of the center is convenient, and doctors and pharmacies are all nearby. 01:27:12 Flushing is like China, and there are a lot of Chinese American. Yuan likes to go to the library. Sometimes she goes there with her granddaughters, but it became too noisy in the recent years. 01:28:46* Yuan loves going to the library in Queens. She thinks Flushing library has been getting noisier. She also went to the Elmhurst library with her granddaughter. Elmhurst library has children�s story telling session on Tuesday 9am. Yuan began going to the storytelling session with her granddaughter in 1999 when she was three years old. Yuan wanted Stephanie to interact with the teachers since it can help with her early education. After that, she also took her younger granddaughter to the library every week. 01:32:12 The postal office in Flushing is dirty, garbage and stickers are on the floor. In 2013, Yuan was a member of the All Community Adult Day Centers and the center held an oil painting exhibition at the Flushing Library and Yuan was part of it. 01:34:35 Flushing in 1991 had less people. Yuan recalls when she had a conversation with a Russian lady on the bus during her first days in Flushing. 01:35:44 Yuan�s daughter always drove her kids to Flushing for classes but it was hard to find parking. 01:37:32 In 2013, Yuan moved to Long Island, but prior to that, she lived in Elmhurst with her family. Yuan describes her life in Elmhurst. She went to the discount store near where she lived because the boss goes to the same church as Yuan. 01:39:05* The Immanuel church Yuan attended was located at 210-10 Horace Hoarding. It was convenient and easy to find parking. The church had to pay 600$ rent per month at 210-10 Horace Hoarding location and it had to move to another location because the landlord raised the rent to 1200$ per month. The church group later moved to the Redeemer Lutheran Church on 3601 Bell Blvd, Bayside, NY 11361 but the church wanted the group to follow their worship format and the group didn�t like that idea. It later moved again to Oakland Garden (at 220-16 Union Turnpike). There were about 80 people who came to Sunday worship before the move, but after moving, the church downsized to 20 as it moved from one location to another. Yuan said that because the church group got smaller, she felt the members of the group became closer like a family. 01:44:18* The church that Yuan was a member of sometimes joined the Chinese Christian Herald Crusades in their community outreach activities. Smaller church groups take turns in participating in their worship and outreach activities. One activity Yuan was part of is singing Christmas Carol in front of the Flushing library. The church group also gave out gifts to people as part of the Christmas celebration. 01:46:15 Because Yuan�s daughter has three kids, it was too crowded so Yuan and her husband began renting and sharing a newly renovated apartment near her daughter�s house with another young Shanghainese couple. Because her daughter lived in walkable distance, Yuan still ate dinner with her daughter�s family every day. They also celebrated special occasions and birthdays at Chinese restaurants. 01:50:14* In 2002, they began renting a small room with a balcony in a shared apartment with another young Shanghainese couple in Elmhurst near her daughter�s family. The rent was 350$ in the beginning but later went up to 470$ in 2013. The young Shanghainese couple worked hard and saved up money to purchase their own house in June 2013 and decided to move out. Because of that, the landlord wanted Yuan and her husband to find a place and move out by the end of August 2013. Yuan Shi had applied for senior housing in Long Island a long time ago, and it was during this time in need, she received a notice to move into senior housing in Long Island. Yuan and her husband later moved to her current residence at the Allen AME senior housing in 2015. Yuan said that her current location is more convenient than Long Island. 01:56:47 Yuan talked about her neighbor relation in Elmhurst and how she wants to grow flowers but no place to grow them. ",

Before choosing to change his gender presentation, his concept of sexuality and gender had no correlation. 00:02:47 When Elliott came out as bisexual his peers were unsupportive. Some thought his sexuality was an experimental phase brought on by puberty. His mother believed he would settle in a “traditional” heterosexual relationship.

Without the safe environment provided by college, Elliott does not believe he would have been able to socially transition. 00:05:54 Elliott attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan from 2013 to 2016. The queer community provided a comfortable space for him to question his sexuality. 00:07:00 Goes into detail about how classmates desired to use inclusive terminology; however, they disagreed on what identity was best to use. For example, there are misconceptions about bisexuality reinforcing the gender binary because the prefix “bi-” meaning “two.” 00:10:00 Undergoing physical and social transition was an act of activism for Elliott. In Pakistani culture there is a varied history of acceptance for trans women, but not the same for trans men. He speaks on the responsibility of being a visible role model in the South Asian community as a trans man and the loneliness of not having a role model. 00:12:00 Peers from Stuyvesant High School followed his transition on social media. 00:14:40 In Queens, the politics has been shifting rapidly in queer acceptance. For example, Daniel Dromm was elected to the New York City Council in 2009 representing the 25th district in Queens. He was openly out. 00:15:47 Elliott suggests non-LGBTQ people should challenge traditional beliefs surrounding gender and sexuality. They should not be afraid to question their relationship to gender and sexual identity. Furthermore, promote acceptance of differences rather than tolerance. 00:18:00 The commercialization of the queer moment has created a strange environment. Corporations do not want to appear outwardly homophobic; in that way they are performing “tolerance” rather than true acceptance. Companies that otherwise ignore the LGBTQ community suddenly view them as a profitable demographic. Then the rainbow flag becomes hyper visible on a multitude products. 00:21:55 Elliot is not out at work, but feels lucky because he “passes” as a straight, cisgendered man due to his relationship with a woman. However, he is concerned because there is no law prohibiting employers from firing people for their gender identity. 00:25:35 Elliott has performed as a singer in Stuyvesant High School’s choir, as well as the Distinguished Concerts International New York (DCINY). In a choir the singers are to present themselves as a unified corps dressing in a single color, typically black. The Principal at Stuyvesant High School was uncomfortable with Elliot’s gender-nonconforming clothes; in DCINY there were no such restrictions as long as one appeared professional. 00:29: 08 Due to testosterone therapy Elliott has had to retrain his vocal range from Soprano to Bass. Elliot has always taken pride in his talent. He is happy that his new voice now accurately reflects who he is. ",
  "Siddiqui_Muneeb_timecode.txt": "Muneeb Siddiqui was born and raised in Queens. In fact, he’s spent his entire life here. During the interview, Muneeb talks about going to elementary, middle and high school in Queens. He worked for a non-profit his senior year into his college years. He loved going to Queens borough Community College because the classes were easy and all his friends were there. When Muneeb started Queens College, the classes were harder and he began driving a yellow cab. He met a lot of entertaining people and learned how to navigate through the boroughs. He later started working as a chauffeur, which was a lot more professional. These days, he’s focusing on Computer Science at school so he can financially stable in the future. Through these experiences, Muneeb has become “a man of God,” thinking about God through all his decisions. 00:00:30 Muneeb Siddiqui is “as Queens as it gets” being born at Queens Hospital, he goes to Queens College and he went to Queens borough Community College. He’s lived in Jamaica his entire life. His favorite places in Jamaica are Jamaica Ave, Central Library, and the Colosseum. 00:01:25 He went to P.S 35. His favorite teacher was his 5th grade teacher, Ms. Salamony because he had a crush on her. He used to do all his work and got straight A’s. 00:02:20 Muneeb went to M.S 217, which was a block away from his house. He went to school with his cousin and couple of his friends he still knows. He didn’t like it. A lot of the people who went to his school were in his neighborhood, they lived in building around one another. His best friends in middle school were TJ, Yahya, Osama and Zee. 00:04:14 Muneeb cut class to go watch “Don’t mess with the Zohan” with his cousin and got caught on the way back by an uncle in their neighborhood. He saw them at Jamaica Multiplex and told his parents. His mom ended up throwing a slipper at his face when she found out. The movie was worth it, it was funny. 00:05:00 Muneeb likes Briarwood a lot more than his old neighborhood on 188th and Hillside because of the people he met there are people he still knows now. During Hurricane Sandy they went on the roof of their building and almost died which he considers a good memory. Muneeb also played a lot of manhunt and he was always the last one. *00:07:12- 00:07:56 taken out the of the interview* *00:07:12 break* 00:07:13 Muneeb went to Hillcrest High School. He was really shy and awkward. He and his Egyptian friend used to cut class and go to Queens Buffet by South Ozone where his friend lived. Earlier when he applied himself he was a really good student, but he didn’t care and slept a lot in class. He didn’t really like high school. 00:09:15 Muneeb ended high school early because he finished all his credits and worked full time in his senior year at IC and Relief, a non-profit organization. He would make bags of food for clients in need. He got the job through his father, who knew the supervisor. That was his first ever desk job and the best job he has ever had. Everyone there was a family. His supervisor would always pull pranks on the janitor. He got fired for not showing up on time after working there for 3-4 years. 00:11:23 Queens borough Community college was fun. Classes were easy and all his friends were there. He took the Q31 to school, except for when time when he took the Q30 by accident yet managed to still make to class on time. He would spend all day there going to class, hanging out with his friends and playing cards. He took Speech communication, English, math, physics, Arabic and fitness, all irrelevant classes to him. 00:14:05 Spring 2014, Muneeb started going to Queens College. Classes were harder and he didn’t really know anyone. That was when he started doing his yellow cab business. He majored in Computer Science. 00:15:22 While driving a yellow cab, Muneeb worked from 5 pm through 6 am. He got to explore his own city and knowing how to get from one borough to another. He knows Queens and Manhattan like the back of his hand. 00:17:18 Hannah, 37 and unmarried, was stunning. She was from Copenhagen. Most people don’t talk to him, they’re just on their phones but she was really interacted with him. He picked her up from the Tavern on the Green in Central Park and dropped her off in Downtown Canal Street. She was a rag to riches; she was dirt poor and then got really lucky with a designing job. 00:18:55 His customers would be very drunk. This kid threw up in the back of his cab, instead of cleaning it; he gave him a $150 tip, so Muneeb had to clean it himself. One time, he took a customer to Penn Station rather than Grand Central Station. 00:20:35 He didn’t think he played into stereotypes. When people heard him talk they were very surprised due to his brown skin. He felt comfortable. He was mostly in Manhattan. He barely went to Staten Island or the Bronx. He would only go to Staten Island to get to Jersey. He liked driving to Jersey because it was good money. 00:22:24 Brooklyn and Queens are the same place to him. Queens in the real “melting pot.” If you want diversity and culture, come to Queens. You can always find something to do. He loves bubble tea and the strip malls in Flushing. There’s hookah in Astoria. 00:23:24 He doesn’t have a lot of free time now due to school and studying. Being a chauffeur was a lot different than driving a cab. You can randomly pick up people; your company gives you clients. You also need to dress and act more professionally. He liked yellow cab better because he had no filter, he can say and do anything he wanted. His clients were a lot more serious, since they were jetlagged. 00:25:15 Now Muneeb focuses on school and doesn’t have a job. He is a “man of God now.” He’s gotten more religious. He was born a Muslim but now he’s practicing. He’s spending a lot of time with his cousin who found answers in the Quran and would preach it to him. Whenever he does something, he thinks about God. Today, he prayed at 5:30 am and then went to the gym at 6 am, he never did that before. 00:27:34 He’s now made friends at Queens College. They’re all at the point of their lives where they’re serious about life. 00:28:45 He’s hoping to be financially secure through education. There’s no moving up from driving a yellow cab, an education gives you more opportunities. In the future he wants to be a mentor and talk to kids. 00:30:00 He plans on staying in Queens. He was raised in a very brown household. He’s a lot more open minded and he knows Queens while his parents grew up in Karachi. They’re looking at things from a different perspective. 00:31:00 He’s seen change in his neighborhood. There’s a Starbucks being opened that used to be a HSBC bank, they’re being gentrified. Queens Boulevard underpass on the Van Wyck is finally done being constructed. Chinks the Rapper got shot by the Dunkin Donuts in his neighborhood. His neighborhood has been both good and bad at the same time. 00:33:10 “Just remember God.” ",
  "Simotas_Aravella_timecode.txt": "I represent assembly district no 36, which covers Astoria and part of Long Island City. I legislate in Albany for the people of Astoria. My constituencies - who I consider my bosses - live here in my district. And what my job entails is going to Albany and ensuring that their interests are accounted for, and that I advocate for them. There�s a myriad of issues in a district like Astoria, that�s very multi-ethnic, very multi-cultural. It�s always been a growing community. Traditionally it was a community of immigrants. Many immigrants came here, like the Irish, and the Italians and the Greeks. Now the new immigrants tend to have Latino backgrounds, or Asia-Pacific backgrounds. It�s always been a place where middle class people have come to raise their families and you know, just look for the American dream. I�m a typical story. My parents brought me here when I was six months old, we emigrated from Greece. We lived in a one bedroom apartment, my brother, my parents and I, and you know I used to sleep on a cot in the living room, because you know they were just two hard-working people. My Dad always worked at a delicatessen. Then at some point he bought the delicatessen and eventually bought a home in Astoria. I went through the public school system here, through college and Law School. I went to elementary school at PS17, right by Athens Square Park before there was really an Athens Square Park. And I went to Greek afternoon school actually not that far from there at St Demetrious. Being of Greek background my parents always instilled in me that you should know your culture and your roots. So five days a week after normal school I went to Greek school! That�s what a lot of children of Greek immigrant parents did, and they still do, even the second generation. Growing up I didn�t really appreciate what my parents were doing, which was ensuring that I understood the language and spoke the language, and knew the culture. You know growing up you don�t want to go to two schools, have no time to play with your friends, watch television, all the things kids usually do. It was about 20 years later that I truly appreciated the fact that my parents had really forced me to�I mean I�d always had to excel in English school too! I mean if I got a ninety-five on a test and not a hundred my mom would sit there and ask why I didn�t get a hundred! She instilled in me my best. She knew I had the capacity and she wanted me to live up to it. My parents� mentality was like �we come here and we worked very hard to give you guy�s opportunities.� - So typical American story. I appreciate particularly the values that my parents instilled in me. I like to call them the immigrant values, of a very hard work-ethic, of always keeping your word, and always giving back to your community. My parents always worked seven days a week. My mother was involved in the PTA, in our local church, everything. I grew up always believing that it was my responsibility, no matter how far I got ahead, to always give back to the community. I�ve actually been involved in local community issues since I was in high school, like raising money for our local senior centers, or orphanages, a lot of different things. When I got to High School I started working for the New York City council in their office of oversight and investigations. I did things like analyze how the MTA spends our money, the fact that train speedometers weren�t working, looking into the sale of lottery tickets to underage minors etc. All these issues that really made me understand how government can change things. After my time at the city council, the former speaker of the council Peter Vallone Senior, who happens to have been the council member for my district, offered me a job to be his local district representative. That was a wonderful way to really meet people. And you know I was doing that in college. And not just in college, I did it in law school too. His son ran for the city council seat here and I ran his first campaign. That was in 2001. Before that, actually the very first campaign I really became involved in was the former Assembly member�s race, ten years ago. So for me it�s particularly meaningful that I sit here, in the office he sat in. I don�t want to say that it was a dream because I never thought that I would run for the seat. Because I�m sure that you know that Albany seats in New York City are like a cheap one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. It doesn�t happen! Or if it does happen, it doesn�t happen often at all. Our senator [George Onorato] who represented all these districts � Astoria, Woodside, Ravenswood etc., retired, and so former Assembly member Michael Gianaris ran for the New York State senate seat, which left this seat open. I was very lucky to have his support, and also of the other elected officials in this area, and even more importantly, of my family and friends and my community. I was a member of community board 1 for nine years; I was on the board of the united community civic association, very active with them. For young people in government I think you can kind of split them up into two. There are the ones who want to run for office and are very aggressive about it. And there are the ones who take it as �ok, well I would like to be in public service and if I can serve the people in an elected capacity great. If not, I�d just like to be involved. I was always in that latter group. You never know what happens. I always lived in this community, but went to law school, worked in the federal court system for a bit, and then I went into private practice, but always being tied to my local community � and to the political structure, like I�ve been a member of the local Democratic Party for years. Not that I came from a political family. I came from a family of two immigrants who came to this country with two suitcases in their hands. You do have a lot of politicians who are born into that scene. So I think it�s a particularly interesting thing that I was able to accomplish. The other thing is being a woman. In the state legislature currently, 23% of the senate and assembly room, i.e. 23% of the legislature, are women. And actually we are about to lose one senior member of the Queens delegation who was serving since the 70s, she�s retired. And then one was nominated to become director of the OSG (basically the State�s landlord), and so if the senate confirms her she�s out the door. I�m sad to lose her as a colleague like that; she�s been a fabulous resource to me as a young woman coming into government. And there are talks about some others of the women moving on. It�s wonderful how welcoming the other women in the senate have been to new arrivals. You would think there might be some kind of rivalry but absolutely not. I haven�t felt it at all. We constantly go to dinner together, to lunch together; they�re always offering their services to me. I mean I�ve got two challenges. First, being a new member, and then second being a woman. Being a new member � I think in any government position � you have to learn the written rules and then even more complicated is the set of unwritten rules. To actually understand how to get something done, you�re not going to read it in any rulebook. You have to develop relationships and understand how to move something through the assembly. I was very proud that within 12 weeks of starting I was able to pass my first bill. It was a judiciary issue � to make it easier for litigants to dismiss their cases without getting intervention from the court which makes it a lot more expensive from them, so basically to open up the court system to litigants who don�t have money to hire attorneys. Everybody was commenting on how fast I did it. I�ll be honest with you my colleagues really helped me. Aside from my predecessor, who has been my mentor since I was a kid, kind of telling me what I needed to do, the whole assembly, especially the women, sat me down and just offered their advice. There are 99 fellow assembly members sitting in the conference that I participate in, the democratic conference. There are scattered women and the rest are men! I�m used to it having worked in commercial litigation in my former profession. It�s no different to that. When you get to a certain level with respect to women in the law, a lot of them don�t find the balance to be able to do it and actually have families. In the Assembly it�s a lot of travelling. I usually leave on a Monday, and I return back on Wednesday or Thursday. I don�t� have any children yet but I can imagine how difficult it is for young women who have children. A colleague of mine Grace Meng, she�s remarkable, she�s got two young boys and I�m in awe of how she does it. The trick is to have a very supportive family structure. She has it, and she�s able to do it. I have another colleague who�s also tremendous, who�s been in the assembly for 10 years, and she�s got 2 boys and a girl. Sometimes she has to go home and come back in one evening because she doesn�t want to be away from home. Sometimes also people convince themselves they can�t do it. I found that with a lot of my colleagues that were practicing law. When they reached a certain level and were either ready to have a family or have a second child they just didn�t think that there was a way to balance it all. I feel that people are very accepting of it now. But you have to make your own set of rules and you have to make it work for you. I hope I am successful and people can see that it can be done. I do plan on having a family as well; I�ve been married for six years. My husband has been tremendous - the most supportive person in the world. Everyone asks me how my husband�s taking it and I�m like �honestly, he gets more excited about it than I do!� I get home and I just don�t want to talk about Albany and he is very engaged. That�s the key to it. The hardest thing is waking up on Mondays and having to drive 155 miles. Especially getting to the point when you get onto the throughway and there�s traffic! I�m very used to utilizing every minute of my day. So the fact I have to be sitting in my car so long driving�I have found very productive ways to use that time. I listen to books on tape, and now I have a system in my car where I can take calls hands-free. And what I�ve also been doing is recording my notes and listening to them in my car. I�ve always filled up my time. When I worked in law I would be in my practice till literally two or three in the morning. The hours are really no different � it�s just that I�m at community events now rather than sitting behind a desk. Nonetheless the hours are grueling. I enjoy the camaraderie. I enjoy setting forth a goal, getting a bill passed that will help small businesses, for example. That�s a major issue for me because small businesses are the backbone of our local economy. They employ so many of our residents and they add so much revenue to New York State, and being the daughter of former small business owners I want to make sure that New York State is a friendly state for them, for the small businesses. One example of the challenges: We have a lot of eating establishments in Astoria. We have issues with the health departments that come up with new regulations and then decide to site restaurant owners or food establishments based on a promulgation that was made literally the day before. I�ve actually written a bill and got a lot of bi-partisan support, support through NY State, that would prevent them from enforcing a new regulation for 60 days and then they�d have to also give the businesses written notice of the new regulation. So if it means you have to install a sink. I�ve patronized the same restaurants since I was a kid. There�s a pizza store, Grand Avenue Pizza, on 30th Ave and 35th Streets. It�s one of my favorite establishments. The owner was telling this story that the Dept. of Health fined him 1400 dollars because he was displaying pizza with meat outside of a refrigerator. He�d been doing that for years. It was a brand new regulation that came out. Of course, the department has to regulate this stuff. But they gave him no notice. It cost him $10,000, because he had to buy the $7000 refrigerator. Pay $3000 to open the door to put the refrigerator in; because he was so anxious to get it in and didn�t know the timeframe, he just bought it from the first vendor. He was worried about his license getting revoked. So all in all it cost 10,000, plus the fine. Then it also affected his rating. He asked specifically does this also relate to pizza with vegetables on it. They said no. I bet next year they will come up with a regulation saying the veggie pizza has to be there too. They have every right in the world to do this, they should be protecting our health, but it�s unfair to fine somebody on a new regulation and not give them time to comply. All the businesses that I patronize always want to make sure they comply with every regulation. I�m also concerned to ensure we have strong laws protecting tenants. There are a lot of tenants here and there are a lot of things that have happened in the past couple of years that are not fair to tenants � the law is currently unfairly biased towards landlords. Children�s health too - one of the first bills I authored was a bill banning toxic toys in daycare centers. The reason the issue came up was that I was at a daycare center while I was campaigning in the summer and I saw that half the markers said non-toxic and the other half were these industrial markers � which a three year old could put in their mouth. The big challenge as a new legislator is understanding how Albany works. How do you get a bill passed? Sure, you write it, but the how do you get it passed. Particularly the leadership in the assembly and particularly the women in the assembly have been so generous with their time, and their willingness to share their institutional knowledge. You can also work to change the system too. I was very happy to be asked to be put on a committee to steer the way that the assembly would be going. That�s an honor for me as a freshman to be put on that committee. Something we know we need to be doing is making it more accessible to the public - making it more open. There�s a cry, a need for that. In March because of the budget I was there four days a week. But typically from Jan through June I�m there three days a week. I come home to the district Thursday, Friday and weekends. I�m always working through the weekends because that�s when the majority of the community events happen. In July we are in the district fulltime until we go back for the legislative session in January. ",

  "Singleton_Bob_timecode.txt": "My name is Bob Singleton and I�m the executive director of the Greater Astoria Historical Society. We're speaking in the offices of the society on the 4th Floor of the Quinn building in the heart of Long Island City. The GAHS represents the neighborhoods that comprised Long Island City, which is one of the three cities that formed greater New York in 1898 - New York, Brooklyn and Long Island City. The goals are to use our past not to weep for what�s lost, but to help build the future. GAHS serves the population of the people of LIC and its surrounding areas. Part of the goals is to help people understand and appreciate the past of our community and also the heritage of this wonderful neighborhood. We have some information on the actual birth of 30th Avenue. The original landowner who went to Astoria village and said he wanted to donate some land to start as a street. That was back in the 1850s. It ran from the East River all the way to 51st Street which at that time was the border of Long Island City. At the start of 30th Avenue it was simply some empty lots that weren�t filled. The trolleys started to run along it in the 1870s and 1880s. Small buildings started to line the trolley route, mostly houses. In those days the area was well spread out, and most of the shops were along the very major streets such as Steinway Street or Astoria Boulevard or Vernon. In 1917 that was really the big boost of Grand Avenue when the elevated train was put in and a station was put up on Grand Avenue. Literally overnight the area became developed into what we see today. It was lined with mostly three story buildings and even higher, where you had the shops and stores on the ground floor, and then in many cases those days the actual owners of the shops would live upstairs. Very interesting, in the early days there were a lot of German stores, and also a lot of the shop-owners were Jewish. It was the wonderful situation where people would live upstairs from their own stores. They were part of the neighborhood, and they supported the softball teams, or the charities within the neighborhood. The consideration in those days was that a healthy neighborhood was a prosperous community. So there was a wonderful relationship between 30th Avenue that started at that time and still exists to this day. Of course populations change, retailing changes over the time. So what used to be mainly retail store or small five and ten cent stores as they called them in those days, or small grocery stores, clothing stores, began to evolve. Today we see 30th Avenue, a different demographic. You see many specialty food stores on 30th Avenue. By the way the name changed from Grand Ave to 30th Ave at some point in the 1920s. Queens adopted what�s called the Philadelphia system, where Avenues that ran East and West, Streets ran north and south. It was a grid that was imposed on the whole borough of Queens. The reason being, that Queens was actually an amalgam, with different townships, villages, and there were a number of different Washington streets, Main Avenues and so on, so what they decided it would be better to have just one system for the whole area. Today if you walk down 30th Avenue you still see some of the original buildings there. For example the original police precinct and the original Long Island City Firemen�s Association. The police station is now the HANAC (Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee) building. The Firemen�s Association is now a medical clinic. But as you go between the area between 31st and Steinway Street, which is considered by many people the heart of 30th Avenue, you�ll see many outdoor cafes, many food specialty shops; the Greek and Italian communities are most known for fabulous food and for a caf� society if you will. 30th Avenue today is in as much demand today as it was when it was first laid out many years ago. As a matter of fact the future of 30th Avenue is very bright, because it�s become an area in much demand. It�s hard to say how it will change in the next 10 years. We are seeing much more housing, taller buildings being put up on 30th Avenue so it will become much more densely populated, if you will, in terms of structures. You�re getting other ethnic groups too � Bangladeshi, Arabic and Albanian and Hispanic, Mexican, Brazilian groups etc. so the area will become still more diverse than it is today. You are also seeing another interesting demographic, and that�s young urban professionals who are moving to New York City. There is a big movement, unlike there was in the mid-20th Century, for the best and brightest of our society from all around the world to move into urban areas. That�s even in the United States, where the suburbs were the thing in the mid-20th century. Well today, I think people are rediscovering the benefits of living in our community. If you walk down 30th Avenue you see all the things that make a neighborhood great. You see vitality, you see interesting people, you see faces there, and you see excitement, a buzz in the community. 30th Avenue is one of the finest parts of what is a fabulous neighborhood. One thing we say about LIC and Astoria is that is has all the benefits of a great city with all the wonderful aspects of a small town. I think the future of 30th Avenue in particular, and its surrounding Astoria and Long Island City, is very bright. ",

There are assistants in charge of his care that visit him throughout the week. 00:31:06 Sonia talks about how friends, who mostly communicate with her via phone. Life here is less bearable to be more expensive. She finds that therapy takes time away from her participating in cultural activities. She then goes on to talk more about her grandsons. 00:36:56 Here Sonia discusses the transitions that were made from when she could see to her losing her sight. She even talks about some of the advantages of losing her sight. She talks about her sick child and that living was more important than vision loss. Life is full of good things. She speaks of this view as the most important of the senses. 00:40:12 Sonia never enjoyed photography when she had sight. Now she knows that a blind person can do anything. Her hands are her eyes. Her friends do not see any interest in her photographic activities, as if seen in those who dedicate themselves to the art of visual communication. She teaches photography and her students are fascinated and impressed by her skills. 00:48:50 Sonia discusses the life of recent immigrants in Queens. Generally she finds that they have higher goals.

There is a lot of selfishness among Hispanics. Hispanic professionals engaged in pursuits such as dishwashers, waiters, etc. because they have poor proficiency in English. She later goes onto discuss their attitude towards life in the United States. 1:33:04 Sonia tackles the question “What are Latinos/as looking for when they immigrate to the United States? Some are trying to send remittances to their families in their home country. This allows their families who live abroad to live well while the same immigrant are stuck in rough conditions in the United States. Some migrants come to the United States without a real need to improve. What happens is that the people here paint them a life where everything is easy. These immigrants come here unprepared and face a life of hardship alone. 1:47:19 Sonia goes onto discuss the subject of Latino boys at school, family life, and the relationship between technology and family. 2:01:13 [Interruption, do not take into account.] 2:02:40 Sonia talks more about her life and reaches into recent immigrants and their goals to overcome obstacles in the United States. She expresses the sentiment that newly arrived immigrant and often professionals find it hard because they have to start from nothing. There is a trend of depression in Latin American professionals because they often have to start from nothing. 2:13:25 Sonia discusses the topic of immigration in Jackson Heights. ",

My favorite memories of Queens is going to Reef park. 00:06:46 when I moved to New Jersey I was 11 years old. I didn’t have any friends because everyone kept to themselves. I miss that Queens is so welcoming because there are so many different ethnicities. 00:08:20 I remember 9/11 I was 7 years old. I was in class and they told us that we were going home early and that our parents were going to be called.

There were just a lot of polish kids at school. 00:13:37 Everyone I knew went to the same Catholic church. I didn’t meet people from other religions until I moved to New Jersey. 00:15:35 when I was 7 my mom got a car and I didn’t have to wait for the bus anymore. My favorite way to get around was to walk because I didn’t have to wait for the bus. 00:17:16 Most of my class was on the basketball team but we didn’t have enough people we asked kids from the public school to join and then we practiced in their gym because ours was so small.

  "Sparta_Phillip_timecode.txt": "Philip Sparta (PS): My name is Philip Sparta. I live on 23rd and Hoyt Ave, so not that far away. I was born in Japan and moved here ten years ago, when I was six. Now I�m seventeen. I got into skateboarding with my best friend over here. Wallace de Olivera: My name is Wallace. What I enjoy about skating�it�s the thrill of actually skating. PS: And it keeps us from doing bad things, you know � we don�t do bad things like most of our friends have gotten into. It keeps us fit; too, it�s very healthy. I go to Bryant High School; he goes to La Guardia High School. Before they thought that the skateboarders were annoying. Once in a while the police would come and kick us out of this park [Athens Square]. We didn�t really care about it � we loved skating so much that we just kept coming back once they�d left. And now since the Skate Park opened [in Astoria Park] we hardly come here - once in a while. But we have other friends here who play basketball. So we come here once in a while to hang out. I actually like it around here. I used to live in Flushing. Over here is a lot nicer, it�s really diverse. It�s nice. I don�t remember too much about living in Japan. I remember moving here, it was so weird. Now I�m totally Americanized. I haven�t gone back at all. I�m not interested in going back really. Just maybe to skate there. Daily I skate about four to six hours, sometimes even more, when I�m not in school. But schooldays I go home around 11 at night. We skate A LOT actually. I�ve just gotten back from an injury � I hurt my ankle. And he did too. But it�s ok, we got back. ",
  "Spector_Maria_timecode.txt": "J - Today is October 28, 2018, I am here with Maria Spector, and...where are we? What cafe are we at? M - We’re in Community Cafe J - We’re in Community cafe in Queens, New York. Ok? J- So just like tell me about yourself. Where did you come from. Did you grow up here? M- I grew up in Queens, but nowhere near here, I grew up in Jamaica, Queens. J- So how was, what was that like as a child, did you have a lot of friends? M- We had a, I grew up in a great place. I grew up in a place called Parkway Village which was built mostly for uh because it was built for the UN actually because a lot of people couldn’t find housing when they worked for the UN when the UN was built. And so it was built and it was a very unique and unusual community within a community so it was sort of an enclosed kind of space within Queens that had mostly a very international. So before I think the Queens of today which is so international this was sort of the beginning of it. And it was nice, it was a nice place to grow up. I had, we had incredible freedom and incredible friends and it was just an amazingly diverse place for...yeah. J- I was going to say so did you have friends of all different types of races? M- Everything and mostly they were from all around the world because a lot of them worked for the UN. So they were just from, you’re actually interviewing another artist that grew up there as well. Well not maybe you aren’t interviewing her, but she’s on the list. J- Oh okay M- It was, I don’t know, people don’t talk about it much, but it had a lot, there was alot, it was a very interesting place it was a lot of political activists and very liberal, socialists, democrat kind of environment, it was just a very unusual place to grow up and I’m still actually friends with a lot of the people from there. J- That’s good. That’s good so when did you end up moving out of Jamaica queens? M- I moved out of Jamaica, Queens in 8th grade, but my mother stayed there so the connection wasn’t ever broken, but I did move out at high school. J- So when you moved out did you live with your dad? M- I moved and I lived with my father on Long Island for high school and my mother remained in Parkway Village. J- Ok okay, now do you mind me asking did they separate? M- Yeah they were divorced. J- Oh they were divorced. Now do you have any siblings? M- I do I have a brother, an older brother J- So how, were you guys separated or… M- No, no well he also moved out to long island for high school. He lives now in Whitestone, Queens. So he’s still in Queens, my brother. J- So how did you feel when your parents did divorce? Like as a child I know some kids take M- Oh no I was quite happy J- OH you were happy? M- Yeah it was a good thing J- Oh wow that’s a first, only because I mean my parents they divorced in 2010 , but they were separated since I was one, but I know that my friends when their parents divorced, they took it a little bit harder. M- Oh no, no I was quite happy. They’ve been separated a number of times and it was quite, it was nice and peaceful, it was, I could sort of concentrate and become a better student and move forward. It was much better. I was quite happy. J- Great, great so how was your High school experience? So I know that you are into art and so when did you...did you start getting into art when you were in high school? M- I did take a, maybe two art classes in high school, but I was a truly undecided kind of kid. I had no goals whatsoever, my only goal was to leave home and go away to school. I had absolutely no other pressing goals, desires, needs, thoughts, wishes, so I was pretty one-dimensional that way. I just really wanted to go away to college. And didn’t have any, I never thought about not going to college, that was it. I was just going away to college. So art was not something I thought about. I think I do remember in junior high that you know, they put you in uh in the city I was P.S. 117 and they did put you when you moved to your junior high, put you in a sort of major or concentration and they put me in a concentration of visual art concentration, but I didn’t want to be in there and I actually switched out to performing arts. So...and I couldn’t see anything which was part of it because I didn’t get glasses until the middle of eighth grade so its hard to be a visual artist if you can’t see. J- So who introduced you to art? M- In college, so I was registered for i think it was a dance history class and it was cancelled, and I had to find something and drawing fit in my schedule, so I took it and that was the first time. So at first in college I was actually a psychology major. And I was a psychology major first and that was only because i didn’t find anything I liked, anyway so and you had to find something eventually. So I’ve tried everything I’ve tried every course you can take. I took philosophy, sociology, psychology, environmental science, oh I really have to go back and think about it, but I tried I think I took every intro course the school tried to take every course the school offered. And since I was sort of up against the wall, I picked psychology which is actually a science where I went so it was a little different then the psychology you get elsewhere. Then I think I was taking up one drawing class and I liked it and then I took another one and eventually, eventually it turned out that I could get an art major if a stayed an extra semester so I stayed an extra semester and so pick up art and Psychology. J- So what’s your specialty? Like what are you most comfortable with? M- In art? J- Yeah, yeah comfortable in art? M-Truly, I’m a figurative painter. You know, I paint people, that’s my strength. That is where I am most comfortable, that’s how I’m mostly trained. And it wasn’t my training wasn’t in college. I don’t think college is really the place you learn to be a visual artist if you’re going to learn how to be a visual artist in a representative kind of way. If you want to be a conceptual kind of artist or a new media artist, I think you can learn that in colleges it stands today but I think you have to go elsewhere if you want to learn some of the more traditional forms of art. J- So I saw that you put on the paper that your mom was Jewish. M- Yes. J- Did you keep that same religion, like did you adopt the religion once you became an adult? M- Well I am Jewish, both of my parents were Jewish, but they’re also rather liberal, atheist kinds of background which I think is pretty common for New York City. It’s not an uncommon, uncommon thing. So I’m Jewish, but I married a man that is Unitarian, if you know what Unitarians are. J- No what’s that? M- They’re sort of the hippies of Christianity. They’re like uh, they’re very… J- Peaceful? M- I wouldn’t say peaceful. They’re sort of...they would be defined under a Christian religion, but they really believe in just about everything and nothing so. But my kids are Jewish because I’m Jewish, but like I said I wasn’t brought up, so I would be brought up culturally Jewish obviously because all my family was and I go to plenty of weddings and bar mitzvahs, but, and I tried to bring my kids to Temple, but I really had a hard time with it myself so I stopped. J- Why did you think that you had a hard time? M- Because I wasn’t brought up with it so it was very alien to me. You know, it’s very, it’s hard to, it’s you’re culturally something, but it’s also a very, very, very difficult- it can’t just walk into Judaism. They make it-, it’s a very-, you have to know a lot. It’s not, I think it’s very different to walk in. My brother married into a Catholic family, it’s very different to walk in to say, a Catholic church and you can figure out things pretty quickly, but in Judaism, you know, they’re talking in other languages, all kinds of other things. So it makes it very difficult, sometimes. But yeah, No, but certainly I’m sure I go back and I’m sure you can- if we did my genealogy, I’m sure it would go back, you know, many centuries...you know. J- That’s really interesting. So I have a quick question. You said that you lost your studio. Do you think it’s from the gentrification that’s happening? M- Oh it’s from the gentrification. I mean I was blessed, I has a studio in Long Island City for 17 years, I had extraordinarily cheap rent for 17 years I had great space. The first space I had, had an amazing view of the city before all the buildings were built so I looked straight out and you would see the like especially like in a thunderstorm, you can see the clouds come out over the city, and it was such an unusual place back then because I would say I came to Long Island City about ‘99 I think, ‘99 or 2000 and I think the only reason I thought to come here was probably because I had a history of Queens so it didn’t scare me away. I think new artists that come to the city wouldn’t think to come to Queens so, but, yeah no I was just gentrified out like many artists. You know most artists here now if you have a studio here you have to have a means to support it. I don’t know, it’s hard to now you know my rent was pretty cheap but now people are paying a minimum of $1000 a month. I mean don’t know how people do that with an apartment and everything else. You know, it’s just people don’t have the cheap studios like they used to. When I came in it was cheap, relatively, but still cheap. J- So do you still practice art at home then being that you don’t have a studio? M- So yeah, I’m lucky I have a house so I have space to work. And the only difference is in the studio here I was willing to use some of the more nastier things I suppose, you know I would be willing to oil paint and such which I won’t oil paint at home because I don’t want to bring in the turpentine into the house. And I don’t want to, it’s too messy so I use gouache and other water media at home. J- Wow. And it makes me like sad because I see New York, and I see how- and I’m only 23, but you know, I see how it was back then and now people who really enjoy art, can’t because it’s expensive. So with that being said, where do you think art is going? In, Queens, like where do you think it’s going to go? M- Going in Queens? You know I’ve been wondering how Jamaica (Queens) will do. Jamaica to me is an interesting neighborhood. It’s got a lot of established communities, but to me that is sort of an area where you might, might be able to get cheaper, cheaper accommodations but, I’m not so sure. I think the gentrification now is moving so quickly, that I think New York City is probably, probably done. J- Wow. M- So most of the artists I know unless they were established in a studio space that they own or for some other reason including some of those loft laws that were around, most of them are going and I don’t see people just going nearby I mean they are going and they are going far away and I know people that are going off to Europe I know at least two artists that have already gone to Canada. They’re going. And I think there are a lot of new artists that come to the city and I don’t think that’s going to stop, but I don’t, but I don’t know how they can sustain it. And what happens is they get a little older, they get married or have a kid and then they can’t sustain it. So I think it depends I think art in New York City right now you’re going to have really young people come out of art school, they’re still going to want to come to the city, but I don’t think they can sustain it past a certain point. So I don’t know there is a lot of artists moving along the Hudson Valley, even that’s gotten expensive now. So it’s hard for me to say, I think New York is always going to be a center to some degree because there is so much going on, but I don’t know. I don’t see a lot of the interesting things that I saw happen early on when I first was an artist around here. You don’t see a lot of the alternative spaces happening because I don’t think you have the young people to make those things happen in a way, so I don't know, I don't know. But there's still, I just went to an open studio this morning before I came here down the block from here, I didn't ask them how much their rent was, but it's got to be pretty high. So, you see I see work getting smaller. People don't have large spaces to work in, so the work is more contained. A lot of the work is not painting anymore, anyway you don't really need a big space unless you're doing certain kinds of work. You can do your work from a little computer at home, you really don't need, the idea of the romantic, I guess the romantic vision of an art studio is not really necessary for a lot of work that's done today anyway except for a place to maybe meet, you know meet dealers, curators, whoever, otherwise I'm not so sure you need it anymore. J - That's so sad, that's very sad. No, because like I don't know like I just wish, I just wish people weren't so money hungry, and you know, artists, truly talented artists who really want it, wouldn't really be able be to do it because they can't afford it, I guess. M - But they haven't been able to afford it for a long time. I mean really art is for the rich at the moment, I mean even to make art. Ask a lot of artists who are, you know how they support themselves, it sounds really awful, but when I was a young artist just starting out I had a very, she was a wonderful artist and a friend and she was in already, I guess she seems so old to me but really she probably wasn’t that old. But and she said Maria marry a doctor. And I said oh shoo, no, come on. You know, I felt especially because I met my husband back when he was, we met in our first year of college, so I was like no, I don't need to marry a doctor. I can support myself, I can make it with art. You know, the fact that she wasn't wrong, so. J - Wow. So, as far as your art is concerned, where did you start like did you start like did you start at like doing art pieces for free? Did you like graduate so like charging people? Like the art that you have right there, did you like charge people? I don't know how art works. M - How art works? J - Like as far as you're like selling it, like or showcasing it. M - Well, there's lots of different ways. That's a kind of a broad question. People will come to my studio and buy my work. If they see my work they might contact me, but most artists are not very good at that and I'm among them, so I don't sell enough. Yeah, so it's not, so most artists like me will end up making money other ways. So, I don't sell enough of my artwork to make a living from directly just from the artwork. There are artists that do, but the art market is also a very extreme market so you have say an artist like Jeff Koons who's so rich that you can't compare, and then you have the rest. So you have really sort of the top, the high end market and then you have really kind of the rest, but they're mostly artists that struggle and then most of them, 90 percent of them will be working some other way or be lucky enough to be you know supported by someone, there's only a handful of artists that really do support themselves from their art. J - So what do you do now? M - When I'm not making my art? J - Yeah, when you're not making your art. M - And not taking care of my children? J - Oh. Yeah! M - I teach art, I teach also. J - Oh, okay. M - So, I teach art at senior centers, I teach art at various places. So most of us and I sell my art when I can, when I can. J - So would you ever be like an art teacher at a school? M - No, I'm not qualified, I don't think. J - No really? I saw that you had a masters. M - Yeah, two masters. It doesn't mean, it's not a master’s in education though, I have an MFA, which makes me say qualified to teach at a college, but I think the majority of art, if you go back 40 years, the majority of arts is like, say got a MFA would have been able to get a job teaching at a college, but that's not really a viable alternative anymore because most colleges don't hire full timers anymore. So you're getting more than half the professors that they're hiring are what they call adjuncts, they are part timers. So, if you only got a few thousand dollars per course, it doesn't necessarily pay to do it and you're not getting health insurance or benefits anyway. J - Yeah. M - So, if you see a lot of well-known artists, you'll see that they actually were college professors. But it's not really, it's not a viable alternative for the amount of artists out there and the fact that they don't hire full timers anymore. J - Yeah. I have a lot of adjunct professors now. M - Yeah, yeah. J - So, I definitely understand M - Be nice to them. J - No yeah, no, definitely. So you have, how many children do you have? M - I have two. J - You have two. Are they older or? M - I have a 17 years old daughter who is going to go to college next year and a 12 year old son. J - So, with the recent, well, no, let me change gears. If you mind me, do you mind me asking like if you're a Republican or a Democrat? M - I'm a Democrat, a registered Democrat. J - Registered Democrat. M - Yeah. J - How do you feel about today's political state? M - Oh, I'm not watching the news anymore, and about three months ago I think I just did and then turned off the radio. I usually I painted always listening to WNYC or NPR and it was interesting, it was always how I was able to concentrate because I can listen to talk radio and concentrate when I paint, and I don't know, I just shut it off. My work is relatively, a lot of my work does have a lot of social commentary in it to begin with, so at this point I just kind of really not, I get the headlines, I look at the front page of the New York Times just to make sure. So, I went from a huge consumer of politics to pretty much not consuming it at this point. J - Oh wow. M - So. J - Why do you think, Why do you think you're not really into it anymore? M - Because I don't think this is going any place good, because I think we're just following a path that is following human nature to begin with. I don't think, I think the US thought itself to be immune to certain things, but it never was. So, I suppose for my own sanity, I mean life goes on. I'll do what I can, I've been going door to door for my local candidate, but I'm not terribly hopeful. J - Dang. You know, because it sounds like that's pretty much everyone's mindset. M - Well, you're voting, right? J - Yeah, yeah. M - You too? J - Yeah. M - And you're voting not just for, you're voting all the way down the line, right? All your local candidates? J - Yes, only because I just, something needs to be like something needs to be done. Like just yesterday I know you've heard about the synagogue. (Referring to the mass shooting that happened in the synagogue, killing about 11 Jewish people) M - Yeah. J - The you know, with all those people. M - And they're all old and its terribly sad. I mean the young, I think the youngest was in his 50's. I mean one woman was in her 90's. J - I saw that and I saw that and just his (President Trump) response about what happened, he said well maybe if it wasn't armed, I mean if it was armed maybe this wouldn't happened. Like where is the compassion. M - That's why I shut off the radio, see? J - Like where is the compassion? M - I think the best thing to do, I really do think at this point is the best thing to do is to work locally and worry about your local candidates and worry about who is on your board of education and who is your mayor, who is your state representatives, because I think the Federal right now, the Federal is going to go the direction that it's going to go, but if you can work from the bottom up, that's really what the Republicans have been doing. They were always very smart of what they did and this has been a long time coming and anybody watching could have seen it coming certainly at the minimum since the Reagan years. It's been coming, so I think that's the best thing. I know even in my school board, my little crummy, my little tiny town's school board you couldn't pay me to vote for somebody if I didn't know they were at least a registered Democrat, minimum Democrat, I take it Democrat, Liberal, Socialist, whatever, whatever, but if they're a Republican I wouldn't vote them for dog capturer, promise. J - Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. That's yeah, no, no, I definitely understand. So, I see that you have a camera right there. M - Oh yeah. J - Did you do photography too? M - No. Well, I have to take, I'm taking some installation shots of my work while I'm here, so I can have a documentation of it. I had some, but they didn't come out very good and the light is a little better today for me to be able to take pictures, so that's why. No, I'm a terrible photographer. I do use it for when I need to. I use it because I had to take to document my work and that kind of thing, so. J - So, how long have you been married? M - I don't know since 1996. J - 22 years. M - Is that what it is? J - Yeah. M - Yeah, I always forget. J - I know because I was born in 1995. M - Yeah, yeah, I know. J - So. M - So then I got married that year, and we got married at the New York Botanical Gardens, in the Bronx. J - Wow. So, how do you, what is your advice on young couples like what do you do, I guess like to stay, what did you do to stay married so long like that? M - I don't know, I don't know. J - No, no, that sounds reasonable. Everybody does everything different, so. M - I think you have to be flexible to rough out the good times and the bad times. You have to be able to ride out all the different ups and downs because I think life is hard and you always have to remember who it is that you always want to be there for even as you're fighting with each other and not to be scared of the fact that you fight each other. I don't know, I've been with my husband for a long time since we met, as a teenager I'm very lucky, but I do think that's part of it. Being able to not always expect everything to be, I never stay angry. Say we have a fight, I would never go to sleep angry. J - I heard that a lot. But sometimes it's hard because you're so mad. M - So when I was really young, I was really angry at my husband and he went to sleep and I was so angry that he’d go to sleep because I was so agitated. I mean you shouldn't do this, but I took a cup of water and I poured it over him, so I woke him up. Anyway, I don't stay angry, he doesn't stay angry, we keep our eye on the ball. I would never insult, I would never call him insulting call or any kind of whatever, whatever, and you have to stay together because and I think it helps to not be rich. J - Oh well, that's true. M - You have to be able to afford to divorce, right? J - Yeah, it's true. M - That's why so many stars get divorced they can afford it. So, if I left my husband I wouldn't be doing as well financially neither would he, he would be struggling. So I don't know lots of reasons, but do you want to know about Long Island City instead of my marriage , I don't know? J - Well, yeah. I just want to cover all bases because M - Yeah. J- No, it's really interesting to talk about it. It's really interesting to talk to you, but okay, so Long Island City, I've never heard of this place. M - You should walk around, we have an incredible view of the city. The piers, before you leave, you should go to the piers, I'll show you where to go. J - Okay. I was also thinking about eating around here because we didn't eat before we came. M - You can eat here. And this is more of, it's like a sandwich bar there's a lot of, you want more restaurant things, kind of things? J - Yeah, yeah. I mean yeah. M - Yeah. This is more of like a sandwich, It’s up to you, you can eat. You want to go get some food? J - No, no. So, with Long Island City I just visited a place in Miami (Florida), it's called the Wynwood and I was kind of, since I’m not from around here, is there a lot of street art here? M - Not really. Wynwood is sort of a design area. J - Oh so you know about Wynwood, okay. M - Yeah. Long Island City, there was nothing here, it was mostly warehouse buildings. A lot of furniture manufacturing and such. Like even the building that I ended up in had been a furniture manufacturer before it became an artist studio space. And as the furniture manufacturers and other industries moved away like they moved to North Carolina, artists moved into the empty spaces that were there. There is a famous street, but it was destroyed which was the graffiti building up this way across the street from P.S. 1 I’m blanking on the name, so you can look it up. It was quite famous and they actually won their court case, the artists, the graffiti artists sued the owner. J - Yeah. M - After he destroyed the building and they won, which was incredible. J - So what kind of art are you into? Are you into like graffiti art, street art, classical paintings? M - I'm more of a classical painting kind of person. J - More of a classical painting? M - Yes, I like people too established themselves for a couple of centuries before I paint them. J - Yeah. M - Yeah. J - So, have you M – It’s not completely. I'm not a really good contemporary artist. J - Have you visited like overseas like maybe like Rome and? M - I've been to Europe. J - Europe. M - Yeah. I've been to Rome, I've been to Italy, I lived in France for a little while. So, I've been around a little bit. I have never been to Asia. J - Never been to Asia? M - No. And I've never been, no but I've been to Europe. J - How do you like France? Why did you move there? M - My husband was working at the Natural History Museum in France, so we were there for a little while. My daughter was a baby when we were there. A: Is your husband also an artist? M - No, thank God. He's a scientist. A: Wow. M - You'll find a lot of artists and scientists get together. Oh that's so, that's so A - I know you would think that. J- Yeah, yeah you wouldn’t think that, yeah. M- very similar artists and scientists, yeah. J - So, while in France do you think your art changed? M - No, no. J - No? M - You know I don't know when my art changed. I think art has just a way of sort of, I don't think France would have changed my art. Most of my art changes with anger, I think the angrier I get the more my art changes. J - Why do you feel as though you get angry? M - (Inaudible due to her whispering), true because I think my art is a little angry. So, I think the angrier I get the more my art changes, probably. J - So M - So the Trump here should do wonders for it I suppose, I don't know, let's see. J - So, when you, do you paint when you're angry? M - Yeah. J - That's interesting, so. M - Better than taking it out on my husband. J - No, yeah definitely. So, when you do have that emotion do you feel like your paintings are a little bit better than like do you feel like you, like do you understand what I'm trying to say like do you? M - It changes the concept, it clarifies the concept, so the angrier I get somehow my, the concept of what I’m thinking about becomes clearer to me. So, that I think helps. So sometimes whatever is the trigger for it, it has to be the kind of thing that you become obsessive about or you think over and over again and you can't stop thinking about it, and then my art will make a jump in a certain direction. If something like that causes me that kind of obsessive anger, not slight anger, but it has to be an obsessive anger. A - What inspired you to do people in your art? Why people? M - I think people are more interesting than places. I'm always fascinated at people that paint without people in there. To me I don't know, I don't see much else, I'm not that interested in… I don't know, I'm more interested I suppose in humanity and in people that I am in outside, and I think people often paint landscape and abstract paintings, because they don't want to be in their own head. I think in this kind of painting you have to really be in your own head, I think it takes a lot of strength to do it because it's a little dangerous. So, I think if you paint a landscape it's a little safer. Forgive me landscape painters, but it's, or landscape or abstract, I know it's very safe, a safe place to be. J - What's your hardest, what you do think you can work on as far as your paintings go? Do you have something that you're not as good at, like some people are bad at painting noses or ears? M - No, I can paint noses and ears. J - Okay. Do you have something that you've always just had work? It's just really hard M - I think in the urban landscape, because a lot of the perspective. Sometimes that would be my, if I, that's something that I have to really think hard about when I do it. J - Urban landscape, what's urban landscape? Is it just something like this? (pointing at a painting on the wall) M - If I wanted to paint buildings. If I wanted to paint, you know then I have to settle down and really concentrate whereas for people I don't have to concentrate. J - Okay. So, when I was driving here we saw a building that was shaped like a K. It had a lot of windows. M - It could be one of the hundreds of new buildings that kind of come up in this area in years, so. J - Would you say that you wouldn’t, like or would you be interested in painting the new Queens? M - The landscape of it? J - The landscape of it. M - No. The people of it sure, not the J - The people of it? M - Yeah. I have no interest in painting the landscape of it. J - That's interesting. Do you feel like it's just because of the gentrification that's going on? Like you just have no interest in the new change that is going on? M - No. Queens has always been changing since I grew up here. It's amazing how different a place it is than when I grew up. It's been in a constant state of change, but I'm not interested and I enjoy experiencing the change, but I'm not interested in painting the change. J - I like that. I'm not. M - I don't know what I said. J - I don't know what you, that was good, that was good, that was really really good. M - I think that’s something like I'm interested in experiencing the change, but not painting the change because my paintings are internal more than external. J - Internal. Internal, what does that mean? M - It means that coming from inside me as opposed from coming outside me. J – Okay. M - So if you're painting the visual landscape, a lot of that painting is coming from the external forces, mine are coming from internal forces. J - Who is your favorite artist? M - Dead or alive? Can we go with dead? We'll go with dead, it's easier. I like Alice Neel. J -Who? Alice? M - Alice Neel. J - Alice Neel. What interested you in her type of style? M - She is, I think if you want to call her contemporary which I think you can, she is the best figurative contemporary painter that I know, in my opinion. J - What about alive? M - I don't know, alive makes it hard and I have a lot of friends all mixed in in there. I don't know it's hard to say. I'm not going to go with a live. J - No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine. So, do you like where art is going in 2018? Like, do you, I'm not really into like painting and art, but like do you like where it's going? M - I'm not really, you know the kind of work I do is not really within the art world. I'm still outside the art world because the kind of work that's going on, you won't see my kind of work at a contemporary art museum, you're not going to see my kind of work at the Whitney or any other place like that. So, I think anyone who does the kind of painting I'm doing is working outside the art world not in it. So, I don't know how to answer that question because art is not what people think art is. I think if you don't have someone who is an artist or someone who is in the art world then I think it's hard to sort of wrap your brain around what art is. Because art is pretty broad right now, and if I went to any place out there, any gallery or anything, I'm not going to see a whole lot of painting. Yeah. And you might see the paintings still sells to some degree, but even so they are really only, the selling is mostly done on the secondary market now anyway. So, I don't know. I'm not, I don't feel myself being part of the contemporary art world. J - What would you say your style of art that you're paintings? What would you say, what would you call it? M – Figurative, figurative. J - Oh you mean? You did say that. M - Yeah, yeah figurative I think would be the closest definition probably contemporary figurative art. J - Contemporary figurative and then figurative would just be like the actual person? M – Yeah, it’s a person. I mean it’s obviously it's not just a, I'm not just painting portraits that would, so they have with certain kind of commentary, so with a social point of view. A - So like the art that you have on the wall here, right? I noticed that it's always the two same women, but they are in different outfits pertaining to what's in the background I guess. M - So what is in the shadows in the background. A - So like for example the one right above you, it's a whole bunch of people holding guns and stuff like that and one of the girls has a dress on it for a target and it pertains to that background. M - Yeah. A - And it's so. M - She also has rubber duckies on the dress too as well. A - Yeah, so it's and then. J - What's the significance? M - Because it's like a duck target practice, and the other girls wearing camouflage for a jacket, their shorts are the stripes from an American flag. A - And why the doll, why the? M - And the t-shirt she is wearing is the NRA logo. A - Yeah. M - The doll is Raggedy Ann because that is about as American a dollar you're going to get. J - Also what was your inspiration behind that? A - Because they are all four pieces, were they all created at the same time? M - The ones with the guns, this one was I don't remember now. I think this might have been the first one with the guns, and then I have others like I don't remember the order. You can see the first one too which is different which has instead of having two girls you have a boy in them. So, but if you, I think the gun he is holding it says bang, right? So it has like a, you have a lot of popular culture commentary using a fair amount of appropriation from other sources in the work. J - So what was your inspiration behind that one (pointing st her paintings)? I see there's a lot of animal tribe, like print. M - Right. So then I have to look at that. A - Are they, because the way M - They are having sex. The animals, yeah. A - That's what I thought they were J - I didn't even catch that. M - Yes. yeah. J - Oh. M - Right. And so the girls are wearing all animal prints and I think, I can't remember I have to look at it to see which animal prints they are wearing, and I think if I'm not mistaken, sorry I forget my own work too. I'm saying, but yeah. So, it's the same thing. So, it's really about guns, violence, sex. J - So, would you call this kind of like a series painting? So, do you remember which one you did first? M - I'm not sure. I think it might have been the guns that I did first, but I'm not sure. There's one at home that I might have done before this, but it might be the one with the guns that I did first, very likely, yeah. J - What prompted you to paint this kind of series? M - I'm sure it was a gun shooting that I heard about. I'm sure, there's been so many lately that I can't possibly tell you which one it was, but if you look at the shadows too it's not just that they're pointing guns, it's not just that they're pointing guns at the figures, but they’re also, there's at least one shadow that is also suicidal. J - Oh my god, yeah, right there. M - So, I'm sure it was one of like I said many shootings. J - Many shootings. I noticed that you have, you said that you have a 12 year old. Are you afraid for? M - For him? J - Yeah. M - He poses for me. That's him in the front painting. J - Oh, he is in one of your paintings. M - Like my kids are actually in a lot of my paintings. They always pose for me, often pose for me. They are cheap, they are free and they are around. So, they are very good natured. Am I afraid for him? Yeah. J - With them. I always, like for like the first day of school was just, I saw a couple of posts on social media just saying oh, I pray that my kid is safe and I don't like that. It's just school is supposed to be a safe haven and. M - You know as a parent nothing makes me angrier than the fact that every time something happens, what happens in my kids school is that they end up more lockdown, like now the kids can only come and go out in one entrance and there's barriers so that they have like, I don't know what you call it, like plastic whatever that keeps the parents out and people out, and then the kids wear this high tech IDs and the principal has video camera surveillance in his office now. So, that's what they have done, and every time something happens the schools gets less of a place to just be and more of almost like a prison. J - I know, yeah. M - And you don't see kids walking on the streets much, so it's kind of sad because when you compare where I grew up in Queens in Parkway Village where I walked out my door and I was out for hours upon hours and the only, and all I knew is that my father would come out on the step and he'd whistle and because everybody in the village knew his whistle the news would travel until it got to me and then I knew to go home. But I don't see that with my kids, they are all, they live in very cloistered environments where people are always keeping them safe. I think that's probably why I bet you a lot of kids have trouble now at college and going away, because I think they are getting, people are rightfully protecting them because you want to protect your kids, but they have lost the freedom. J - I like that. So, when your daughter goes off to college, are you going to be comfortable with her like? M - I have no choice. J - Does she want to stay in? M - I don't know. Let's see what she wants and we'll give her a bunch of options, we'll see, it depends on how much it costs and we'll see what happens. J - Is she into art? M - She is into art. She likes art. J - She likes art. M - But, I think she's smart enough not to be an artist, so. J - Does she do it on her free time? Does she like a painter like you? Does she like drawing? M - No, no, no, but she's creative. You know art is, I think art, people make a mistake, they think art is about just drawing. Anybody can draw, but you have to go beyond that to be an artist. You can't just draw and just paint, you have to, there has to be something else behind it. So, you have to have I think a creative mind and that's where it becomes, it is where a scientist is a lot like an artist, you have to, it's about the creativity behind what you're doing. How you express it, maybe you express it as an artist or you express it as a scientist or you express it as someone in communication, but it's what’s behind it that makes it interesting, otherwise you're just an address. J - So what advice would you give in aspiring artist who does want to pursue their dreams and? M - Go to med school. J - Yeah. M - Yeah. Oh really, I'm not joking. J - Oh man. No, I know that there are some, a couple of artists that would love, just make a living off of selling their art and. M - Some do. Don't get me wrong, some do. All I'm saying is that it takes certain, certain things have to align to be able to make, I think make money from selling your art. I think there’s, you have to have the right kind of personality. We have to play your cards right, you have to be, an artist has to be a business person, that's forgotten a lot. I have to be as good as business person as I am at making my paintings because if I'm not, I'm not going to make it. The fact is I'm not such a good business person, so I struggle a lot more than someone who would be a better business person, but maybe not as good as an artist. So, you're self-employed as an artist so you have to worry about all those self-employment kind of issues like whether you have health insurance, how do you get health insurance if you're self-employed. So, if I were to give my advice to my kids it would be absolutely not to be a visual artist. But I wouldn't tell them, if they wanted to, Id be a 100% in support if they wanted to, but you know. J - So, what painting, I'm sure you've painted a lot of pieces. Do you, what one piece would you want to be remembered for like? M - I don't know. J - You don't know? M - I haven't made it yet. J - Oh okay. M - No, I think my work is better with everything I make. So, until I die. So, ask me at my death bed. J - Okay, so besides your paintings, what's one thing that you would want to be remembered by maybe something that's passed down to your kids, and their kids, which one thing that you just, which one thing that you would want people to remember about you? M - I was a good mother. J - That's good, that's good, that's good. Sorry, I'm just like engulfed in my own thoughts. M - Yeah. You want to pause and think about what you want to ask? You can do that, it's okay with me. J - Yeah. No, you know what, I remember because I like, the reason why I didn't really prepare any questions, I wanted us to be more organic as possible. So, that's probably why and sometimes I'm like engulfed in my own thoughts. M – Now are you going to send me, so I have an audio of this too? J - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah of course. M – All right. J - Of course, of course. This will be yours, so you'll have complete ownership of this. So, in any event that I want to, I don't know not sell it, but I wouldn't M - I don't think anybody is going to want to buy it. J - No, no, no, but like you will have complete ownership. So, if I would want to give it to Queens College or another organization. M - So, my MFA is from Queens College too. J - Ha, I'm sorry? M - My MFA is from Queens College. J - No, not Queens College. Queens Library. M - Oh okay. No as you say, yeah. J - Yeah, so I would always let you know where your voice is going to go and you'll have complete ownership with it. Just say we do monetize over it, I don't think so. I don't think we would ever, because this is supposed to be a free kind of thing, so. M - Right. J - Yeah, but you'll know. M - Okay. J - I'll definitely let you know. So, as far as the list that we got, who contacted you about it? Like how did you know that your name was going to be on the list? M - I think they contacted the Long Island City Artists which is a non-profit group and they look for recommendations and they recommended me, because I think it's a small community, it used to be a small community and so we all kind of know each other, so. J - Have you ever done this before? Like were you like, is this a reoccurring thing where people come in and interview you? M - No, but what's interesting as over the years I have a quite few people come to take pictures of me and my studio. That was a thing for a while. J - Oh okay. M - Yeah. J - Only because I'm wondering only because maybe I don't know would you want to be interviewed every year by different students? M - I don't care, I like young people. J - Oh yeah. What else? What else? M - You can pause for a sec, once you pause for a second think about it. J – Can I pause. M - I know that when they contacted me they seemed to be interested in having people that were from this neighborhood, so they seemed to want to know about the neighborhood. At least that was my thought. A - Okay, I have one for you. If you, let's say you grew up now in 2018 and you're 20 years old, how do you think your art would have changed as opposed to growing up back then? Do you think you would have taken a different path? Do you think you would have stepped with the same premise of people, stuff like that? M - I don't think I would have taken a different path. I think I would make just the same dumb decisions I made then that I will make now. J - What would, what advice would you give to yourself, your 20 year old self? M - To take advantage of the really wonderful opportunities that I did have that I don't think I took as good advantage of some of the opportunities that I had over my time. J - If you were to do it over again, would you still be an artist? M - No. J - What would you be? M - I don't know. I love making art. I think it's caused me a lot of misery. I'm just, I think it's a really rough field to be in and I think it's, and I think that this is not a good time to be an artist, I think. So, I mean it's not fair to say I know people often think that you're supposed to be, you couldn’t be nothing else, but you had to be an artist, and I don't think that that's, I think there's a lot of creative endeavors. I think as long as you're creative, I mean I love making art. I just didn't think it would be, I didn't think being an artist would be so difficult. I'm happy, I'm lucky, I'm lucky to live a creative life, but I think it's not the, it's a very idealized world. I think people from the outside think of romanticized artists and their lifestyle and who they are and what they are, but in fact it's a pretty brutal lifestyle. J - Do you see yourself opening up another studio not here, but somewhere else? M - Yeah, I do. Absolutely, yeah. I think I'm sort of I'm working, I mean I have a studio, it's just in my home. But I do have a whole room to myself. So, I do have a studio. Will I eventually convert my garage into a studio or move away or get another studio? Yeah, I don't think I'll ever have another studio in any of the burrows of New York City anymore. J - And when did you find, your city was here in Long Island City and you lived in Long Island City you say? M - No, I lived in Astoria since the mid 90's I lived in Astoria. J - So how did you find, was this always like, this place, I'm sorry. You said that your studio was in here. M - I found Astoria first before I found Long Island City. I found Astoria because I was with my husband, oh he wasn't my husband at the time, I guess I was with my boyfriend on the subway and his back went out and we got out of the train and it was in Astoria and I looked around and said I can do this and the rent was cheap, I think it was $500 a month, I believe my apartment. So, we settled into Astoria and then I needed to find studio space, and I think I would not have thought about Long Island City had I not been from Queens because Queens has quite a, nobody from the outside world was ever going to come to Queens. Maybe there are a little bit now, the outside world, and when I say the outside world I mean I think, what I'm saying is that the sophisticated college student from the Midwest who wants to make it big in New York wasn't going to come to Queens. So, that meant that the neighborhood around here was sustainable for a long time because we kept it quiet. It was a lot of serious artists that were working here, but there was not much of a scene here. There wasn't a party scene, there wasn't a lot going on, there were just people making their art. A - Could you say that Queens influenced your artwork? M - Yes. A - How so? M - I just think, I think Queens is a very, I think because in Queens you always had to be on a state of change. You have to be always in a state of creativity to survive in Queens. It's not a quiet place, it's sort of a moving place, and so to keep up with Queens and keep up with art you have to keep up with Queens, you have to keep up with each other. J - Okay. A - And it makes sense because that's how, I can tell in your work that its relevant and that's why you're keeping up with. M - Yeah, yeah. A - It shows, it shows. J - So, you said that you lived in Astoria, I mean sorry. You lived in Astoria, you had your studio in Astoria too? M - I did work when I lived alone in Astoria. I did work at home in my flippy slippers and I wouldn’t go out for like I think for days, but I did work from home. But eventually I stopped working from home because my husband moved in with me, although like I said I don't think we were married at the time, but I can't remember. And then I needed a space to work, and then I got a space like everything that was done in Long Island City, I got a space by word of mouth because everything was who you, to get a space in Long Island City was never easy. I think Brooklyn you could find a realtor to get a space, but in Long Island City it was you had to know somebody and so I knew somebody and they told us about the space. Anything I’ve ever, anything in Long Island City was always like that. J - So your friends that, was it a shared space? M - My first space was a shared space and the person that got me the space, my connection was because I spent about three and half years at the Art Students League, do you know what the Art Student League, is? J - No. M - That's on 57th street around 7th avenue and it's an old fashioned art school where people that want to learn how to paint in an old fashioned way go. So, I went there for about three and half years, and I knew, so that was my connection to I knew somebody from there. Here, he got me the space and everything. Everything is tied to that, yeah. J - Are you still friends with most of your art friends? M - Yeah, yeah, most of them. J - Are they finding it, not no, I mean do they still have studios around here or do they kind of branch out in other places as well? M - I should say the people that had studio spaces over long periods of time have already moved on, because we've all been gentrified out, but I still know plenty of artists that have spaces here. J - Is it because they are, are they working like with art and then working like a day job or is it just because they? M - Yeah, you know every artist is different and how they support themselves is all very different, yeah. J - I'm just thinking about how like what is this city planning on doing, like with this whole gentrification thing, like you don't know, but I'm just like thinking out loud like are they trying to, I would think they would want to keep the real authentic art. M - Why? J - Because it's A - Its part of history J - It's a part of history, it's a part of history, why would they want to M - Because it's money. You know maybe they’ll give a little lip service and try to make it viable for artists to some degree. But if you have somebody who can pay $5,000 a month rent, why would you do that? J - Because just knowing that there are artists out here that can M - So? J - Yeah, you know. M - You know I'm just saying. J - Yeah. M - This is why it's hard to be an artist. I can't compete with somebody working on Wall Street, and if somebody on Wall Street wants that space, they are going to get that space, and I can't count on them being a good person or believing in the arts. I can't count on that. J - If you were in charge of Long Island City, like if you could stop the gentrification here, what would be your plans as far as like would you let people not like obviously paint, not like have a city for free, but like what would be your ideas to kind of keep art here old like how it was back then? M - Back when I got a studio, when I was yeah? J - Yeah, but would you keep it like that, would you like what would be your? M - When I was in Long Island City you wouldn't recognize it at all. It was mostly, it was closed down on the weekends, there was nobody walking around, because it was really a hard hat neighborhood. So you had the guys in hard hats here during the week and you'd have like little delis where you could get like chicken parmesan and there was no, there was none of this. This café came in well after me. I wouldn't do anything, I’d just let it be. Yeah, I think what an artist needs, the artist needs, if people really want artists then you need to have universal healthcare. That would make it viable to be an artist, an artist is no different than any freelancer. So, if you want people that work freelance then there has to be a viable way to survive. So, you have to have universal healthcare and affordable living. I don't think affordable living is going to happen in New York City as long as people want to be here, they all pay to be here and right now given the politics, I don't see how we're going to have universal healthcare. So, I don't think it's viable for artists. J - Do you see yourself settling in New York or do you see yourself living somewhere else in…? M - You know I would love to be, certainly it would be my preference to be in New York City if I had my way, but it's not viable. It's just you know, it's not sustainable. J - You said that your mom still lives where you grew up. M - My mom is dead. J - Oh my god. Oh my god. Sorry. Oh my god. M - That's okay. J - So well, let me rephrase that. Did your mom stay in that area when once you separated? M - Yeah, she never left. She died there, yeah. J - Oh okay. And then when you, where did you live when you moved from your mom? M - For four and a half years I lived on Long Island in a small town called West Hempstead Long Island in Nassau County. J - Oh okay. And then you moved from there? M - And then I went out to college and the house was shutdown in there because everybody that was there moved away, and I think, so I lived upstate New York while in college and then my dad ended up in Bayside Queens, so I come back to visit him there. J - Have those areas changed as well? M - Bayside, I mean I always imagined it's more expensive. Well, actually Bayside has got much more Asian, a much larger Asian community has moved in to Bayside, because that's where all along the north shore and Flushing. So, as for where I grew up the UN is not there anymore, so that's changed a lot, that's not what it was. The UN school I should say moved out. J - The UN school. Oh from the people that you grew up with. Okay, I remember. All right, I think, oh yeah, all right. I think, unless there's anything that you want to say, being that it’s in the archives, is there anything that somebody from 2132 would want to know about Maria Spector? M - No. J - No? All right. ",

  "Stark_Alan_timecode.txt": "00:00:48 Alan works as the Beacon Director in M.S. 216 in Fresh Meadows. The Beacon is sponsored by the Samuel Field Y and funded by the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development. This is his 24th year in the Beacon world and his fourth year as director. 00:01:25 Alan was born on the Lower East Side of New York, on Montgomery Street. He moved to the Pomonok Houses in Flushing Queens, when he was three years old. He lived in the Pomonok Houses until he was in his twenties. 00:02:09 Pomonok was a very unique place to grow up, with lots of kids (Baby Boom after World War Two). Every building had a multitude of young people. You started in your own court and worked your way to the park at P.S. 201 or the community center. As you got older, you ventured more and more outside your neighborhood. 00:02:43 Being inside your neighborhood was a very secure, safe place to be, with lots to do, organized or not. There were different sports for different months of the year. 00:03:34 Alan created a film of about the Pomonok Houses. He thought it would be an interesting film about growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, about what the world was like back then. He started it in the 1980’s, but nothing came of it. About twenty years later, he partnered with Terry Katz, who also lived at Pomonok and is a professional film editor. The movie is Pomonok Dreams. 00:04:29 Pomonok was an interesting place to grow up for a lot of different reasons: making friends, having friends for a life time, families getting together and spending time together. Families looked out for each other. With everything new and changing in the world, living in Pomonok helped him to relate to that. 00:05:25 When Alan was a child, he and his friends explored the housing complex basements, played blind man’s bluff, played in the storage rooms, played ringolevio, punch ball, baseball, softball, stoop ball, and stick ball. 00:06:22 When he and his friends got a little older, they started listening to the big kids talk about girls and growing up, and as they got older they ventured out into the playground and met kids who grew up in the other courts and other places too. The park was so popular people came from other neighborhoods – there was city-funded Shakespeare in the Park and Harvest Moon dances. Families brought chairs and watched performances. It was exciting - something special in the neighborhood. 00:07:26 Alan started working for the Pomonok Community Center, as part of the Urban Corp, in his teens. 00:07:59 Pomonok was public housing, funded by the New York City Housing Authority, but the kids did know what that meant. It was a clean and nice place to live. 00:08:35 The maintenance men kept the buildings clean, people looked out for each other, and the families kept the housing project very clean. The grass was mowed, and families were kept off the grass with fines. Every spring, a truck came with pesticides. The kids jumped behind the truck and sucked in the air. They did not know what was in the pesticides back then. 00:09:48 There was a library in the community center – it opened Alan up to the world of books. He learned how to play pool, work with his hands in the shop. There were boy scouts, cub scouts, girl scouts. They learned how to play all types of sports. It was a great place to go. The children could come and go as they pleased. Parents knew where they were. 00:10:42 Alan still lives in the neighborhood called Electchester. He was filming in Pomonok for four years so was back at the Pomonok Houses. His mother moved out in 2000, so had not been back much before he started filming. Now, there is not enough money for upkeep as it should be. The people are trying hard, struggling to maintain the rent and keep the environment the way it should be. 00:11:51 P.S. 201 was a two-minute walk from his house, but Alan had to attend P.S. 163 on the other side of the Long Island Expressway. 00:12:53 P.S. 201 then built new wing in the 1950s, and the younger P.S. 163 students could go there, but Alan had to stay at P.S.163. 00:13:27 Alan remembered when New York City Mayor John Lindsay came to Pomonok – he came to the community center. President John F. Kennedy came in 1960 when he was campaigning for president. Alan watched the motorcade from Jewel Avenue and Parsons Blvd. Thousands of people were watching the motorcade – it was a big deal. 00:14:26 Celebrities from Pomonok: Vic Hershkowitz, the greatest American handball player, played in P.S. 201 park. The Doo-wop group the Cleftones practiced at Pomonok. Other celebrities included: Irv Gikofsky also known as Mr. G on radio and television, Mike Starr (a character actor), Billy Starr, Mike’s brother, who played football for the Jets. 00:16:30 Queens College is next to Pomonok Houses and was a great resource for people growing up there. Alan and his friends would sneak into the gym in the summer to play basketball. They would also sneak into the swimming pool. The college would invite all the camps from other parts of the city to swim in the pool. He and his friends would blend in with the kids from the day camps. They would play basketball as they got older in the gym at night. They attended concerts at Colden auditorium. They saw great groups of the 1960s and 1970s: Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Billy Joel, The Byrds, Laura Mulva, and the J. Geils Band, many great rock and roll concerts. They would get in without a ticket. 00:18:06 There were anti-war protests and rallies in the 60’s held at Queens College. There were protest marches from Queens all the way to Manhattan on the Long Island Expressway. The unity of that time was fabulous. 00:18:34 When Alan was about twelve, he and his friends tried to find glimpses of the nude models at the Queens College night-time art classes. 00:19:25 The college also has wide open fields and they would play football. 00:19:45 Everyone got along before the Civil Right Era, there was no big deal internally. As he got older, he understood that people were not treated right on the outside and things had to change. Pomonok was a very liberal place and the neighbors were from all from different backgrounds. 00:20:33 People were judged by whether you were a good person or not, not the color of your skin, your ethnicity, or your religion. 00:20:57 During the 1960s, most of the residents were Roman Catholic or Jewish. There was a Lutheran Church on the corner. In December, you could look up and tell, by the lights on the windows, what religion people were. People were proud to share their religion. Families celebrated Christmas and Jewish holidays. 00:22:11 There was always a rivalry with Electchester. Electchester eventually got air conditioning. Alan lived on Parsons Boulevard and could hear their air conditioners. There were sports rivalries and snow ball fights. Electchester was thought of as one step up, but they really didn’t think that much about it. Electchester was slower to integrate. The two groups of kids mixed together in school. There is still a rivalry, but Alan always sides with Pomonok. 00:24:10 Alan’s first marriage lasted for three years. In 1988, he married again and is still married. His wife did not come from the neighborhood. She was from Florida and grew up on Long Island. 00:24:44 Many of Alan’s friends married neighborhood girls. This perpetuated the friendships because the girls were friends too. Alan did not do that. 00:25:06 Alan has two children. His daughter, age 29, is a VP at JP Morgan Chase. She lives in Manhattan. His son, age 24, plays professional basketball in Israel. This is his third season. The apartment is very quiet now. 00:25:48 His wife is black. He did not seek that out. They met at the right place at the right time. It was a not a big deal for either of them. They raised their children as bi-racial. They did not lose friends, people were not against it. His wife is more conscious of people staring, but he does not recalls any bad incidents. Alan is proud of how his children were raised. 00:27:25 Alan’s children went to school in District 26, P.S. 221. He worked at Samuel Field Y, so he needed a bus that would take them to the Y so he could pick them up after work. They did not go to school in Electchester or Pomonok so they had many friends outside the neighborhood. His son also had many friends in the neighborhood because he played sports, but his daughter’s friends are mainly from outside the neighborhood. 00:28:30 Queens is a lot of people with interesting stories. Queens is a unique place because of the diversity. The complexion of the borough is changing, getting browner. There are people from countries Alan did not know existed when he was growing up. Downtown Flushing is transformed today, it is like an international city – you would not know where you are. As Director of the Beacon program, he deals with parents from all different backgrounds. The changes are amazing to him as is the diversity of people he comes in contact with. Growing up in Pomonok helped him understand diversity. Queens is thriving because of that diversity. ",
  "Steele_Judith_timecode.txt": "00:01:05 Judith notes that she’s doing this interview for the sake of future generations. It’s important for her because Judith has two children and four grand-children. She’s a survivor of the holocaust. Judith needs to tell her story to bring peace to the world. She wants people to stop killing each other 00:02:28 She lost her parents in World War II. Judith still remembers people being taken away. An organization separated the children and parents. They took the parents to Auschwitz. She never saw her family again. 00:03:48 Judith starts talking about her childhood. She was born in Berlin. She’s glad that she’s alive to tell her story. Judith’s mentioned a crazy man who convinced the world that Jews are evil. She said his name was, ‘Adolf Hitler’. 00:05:45 Judith’s parents were taken to camps. They were tortured and killed. This was in 1938. Judith was the only child. 00:08:05 Judith recalls a famous night in November, 1938. It was called ‘Kristallnacht’ which translates to ‘Night of Crystal’. 00:09:10 * She doesn’t remember what happened to her parents because she was only 14 months old at the time of Kristallnacht. It was then when her parents desperately tried to get out of Germany. After many attempts, Judith’s parents were finally able to book a passage on a ship. The name of the ship was SS St. Louis. Her parents took all the money they had left. Their business was destroyed. Her family name is Coppell. Her father was a fur dealer and her mother was a milliner. She remembers that her parents were very gentle and loving people. It took the ship ten days to go from Hamburg, Germany to the harbor of Havana. The ship stayed in the harbor of Havana for ten days, because they weren’t able to land in Cuba. Judith’s uncle’s family came to the ship from Cuba to talk to her parents and told them to give them Judith. Judith didn’t understand what was going on. They were rejected in Cuba. She remembers the ship’s captain’s name, ‘Gustav Schröder’. He tried to save everyone’s lives by trying to go to one of the countries in the Western Hemisphere. But, they were rejected from all of them. They were chased away from Miami coast by the American Coast Guard and they told the captain that they were violating United States’ territory. The order came directly from President Roosevelt. 00:15:02 Judith mentions that they had to go back to Europe. She has a picture of her mother on the ship where her mother has a horrified reaction upon hearing that they have to turn the ship back to Europe. 00:16:24 She learned most of her history from the story of the Voyage of the St. Louis. Judith was on it with her parents and her grandfather. 00:17:13 Her family chose to go to France. They went to a town called ‘Nay’ in the southern part of France. They were safe there. They rented an apartment in the home of a French Catholic family. Judith recalls the happy memories there. 00:19:42 * In August of 1942, France was occupied by Nazis. The police came to their apartment and told Judith and her family to leave with them. Her grandfather was left behind, because he was sick. As Judith, her mother, and her father were getting ready to leave, her grandfather was lying in bed and crying. Judith comforted her grandfather before leaving. The police took them to a camp called ‘Gurs’. From Gurs they took them to another camp called ‘Rivesaltes’. She has very vague memories of that, but the memories she has are forever stuck in her mind. Rivesaltes was the camp where the Nazis gathered the Jews before taking them to Auschwitz. She was in a long house where they put the children. She recalls her mother playing with her and suddenly stopping to tell her, “Judi I want you to be a good girl. Mommy and daddy have to go away.” Judith still remembers the look on her mother’s face. 00:23:30 Judith’s father took her to an organization called ‘OSE’ that were taking the children to safety. She recalls this whole event perfectly. This was the day the last saw her parents. She remembers crying for her parents the next day. 00:25:25 * Judith remembers the next day and saw that all the adults were taken away to Auschwitz. She was taken back to the house where they rented before by the OSE. Her grandfather was extremely happy to see Judith. Judith was malnourished. Her landowner, also her second mother nourished her back to ‘life’. Doctor said Judith wouldn’t survive, but she nourished her back to normal. Judith spent one month in the camp. She remained with this family throughout the war. They never tried to change Judith’s religion. They treated her righteously. Judith made sure to write their names in the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. Their names are there in the Garden of the Righteous. They risked their lives to save Judith’s life. 00:30:25 Judith shows pictures from her childhood. 00:31:20 She talks about what happened after the war ended. She went to school in France for four years. She recalls some silly moments from her childhood. She remembers when she was going to the doctor, Nazis came in and started shooting. She ran to a jewelry store to hide. The Nazis wanted to take over the town. The mother ran down to the store to protect them. 00:39:22 Judith recalls the moment when her second mother protected her and a Jewish gentleman she was hiding in the attic. When the Nazi came to the door, Judith’s mother dressed her normally and made sure her hair covered her ears. Nazis had a superstition that Jewish people have big ears. She also told Judith not to speak at all. 00:42:47 When the war ended, Judith went to a camp and spent few months in the summer time with OSE. She was in the camp with orphans. Judith didn’t want to stay there. Her second mother went to pick her up. 00:44:00 Judith recalls a comedic moment when she first got drunk. She had her passage to America arranged. Her second mother was very sad when Judith had to go to America. OSE wanted to reunite Judith to her blood relatives. 00:49:00 She was afraid of getting rejected by her new family because she had lice in her hair. The ship went to New York. The ship wasn’t allowed to land in New York because of dock strike. However President Truman made special accommodation for the children in the ship. Then she met her new family, which was her aunt and uncle. 00:51:40 Judith describes the first time she came to New York. It was a strange feeling to her. She wanted to go back to France. She wanted to see her mother again. 00:51:50 She describes the moment she reunited with her second mother. Judith thanked her for saving her. ",
  "Stein_Greg_timecode.txt": "Greg Stein discusses three decades of involvement in LGBTQ advocacy in Queens. He has volunteered for and served on the boards of the AIDS Center of Queens County, the Queens Pride Parade, and the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens. Mr. Stein has been the Treasurer of City Councilman Daniel Dromm’s District Leader Campaign since 2003. 00:00:00 – 00:00:15 Metadata 00:00:15 – 00:03:03 Briefly, Mr. Stein speaks about his involvement with the Aids Center of Queens County (ACQC) since the late 1980’s. Started volunteering at the AIDS Center of Queens County (ACQC) in 1991, joined their Board in 1994 and served for 21 years as Secretary, Treasurer, and then Vice President. ACQC offers social services assistance (advocacy, education, testing, legal services, housing referrals, etc.) for individuals affected by HIV. ACQC then became part of a larger, San Francisco-based organization, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. 00:03:03 – 00:05:10 Briefly, Mr. Stein discusses his involvement with the Queens Pride Parade Involvement in ACQC led Mr. Stein to become involved in the Queens Pride Parade. Mr. Stein became Treasurer of the Queens Pride Parade committee in June 2000 and served as Treasurer until 2012. He also directs traffic on 37th Ave. on the day of the parade. Mr. Stein also helps organize Winter Pride, an annual fundraiser held by the Queens Pride Parade to raise money for the parade. 00:05:10 – 00:06:22 Briefly, Mr. Stein speaks about his involvement with the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens (LGDCQ) LGDCQ is borough-wide, not neighborhood-based. Mr. Stein served as Secretary and Vice President of the club. 00:06:22 – 00:08:00 Mr. Stein speaks about how he got involved in AIDS and LGBTQ advocacy Heard about “gay-related immune deficiency” (GRID) in the news and realized that his friends may have been susceptible Attended meetings around New York City (at Body Positive, People with Aids (PWA) Coalition, and Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC)) to educate himself on the topic Learned about ACQC at a street fair following the Manhattan Pride Parade 00:08:00 – 00:11:13 Mr. Stein on knowing people suffering from HIV at the height of the crisis “In 1995, HIV was essentially a death sentence.” In that era, ACQC’s work focused on end-of-life care and burial arrangements Mr. Stein explains how HIV operates in the body. Mr. Stein explains how HIV prohibited people from working, and therefore being able to afford housing, food, medication, and other basic needs. 00:11:13 – 00:13:26 The discovery of “protease inhibitor” drug in 1995 made HIV treatable, and no longer a “death sentence”. In the 1980’s and 90’s, Mr. Stein attended many HIV funerals. He notes that he has attended very few funerals because of HIV since 1995. 00:13:26 – 00:15:14 Prior to 1995, there were many “false starts” regarding HIV treatment, so people were skeptical of the protease inhibitor’s effectiveness when it was first introduced. Protease inhibitor couldn’t reverse disease for people whose infection was far along, but was “lifechanging” for newly-infected people. 00:15:14 – 00:21:22 On how ACQC’s mission and services changed over time with medical and social developments regarding HIV/AIDS ACQC’s first office was in Richmond Hill, Queens. Met with resistance and hostility from the community, and assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio. In 1988, ACQC was forced to move, and relocated to Rego Park (63rd Dr. and Queens Boulevard). (NOTE: ACQC subsequently moved to Jamaica, Queens when the Rego Park building was rezoned from being commercial to residential). As more people became infected, public perception of the disease changed and became more accepting. As a community-based organization (CBO), ACQC receives state (New York Department of Health’s AIDS Institute) and federal (Ryan White grant) government funding. Explanation of how the “Ryan White” grants got started The types of services ACQC offers haven’t changed, but the number of people using certain types of services has. For instance, ACQC still arranges for housing for HIV-positive people, but now that the disease is mostly manageable and doesn’t prohibit most people from working, they focus less on end-of-life and burial services. 00:21:22 – 00:25:42 On how relying on government funding influenced/es ACQC’s programming New York State AIDS Institute encouraged ACQC to establish a needle exchange (“harm reduction”) program for intravenous drug users in Queens. Such programs already existed in Manhattan and Brooklyn, but not in Queens, the Bronx, or Staten Island. Encountered community resistance when searching for a location AIDS Institute also funded ACQC having lawyers, an education program, and condom distribution 00:25:42** - 00:29:24 On encountering/overcoming community resistance in AIDS/LGBTQ advocacy In Richmond Hill, community resistance and hostility forced ACQC to relocate to Rego Park When working to establish the needle exchange program, ACQC visited community boards of areas with high instances of HIV. Thomas Freidan, NYC Department of Health Commissioner at the time (now of the CDC), accompanied ACQC’s Executive Director to community board meetings. HIV statistics by zip code collected by the Department of Health helped ACQC provide evidence to community boards about the need for intervention in their communities The need for needle exchanges was concentrated in Queensbridge, Far Rockaway, and Jamaica. Needle exchange program operates out of a van 00:29:24 – 00:34:30 Queens Pride Parade First Queens Pride Parade was in June1993. Mr. Stein joined the parade committee in 1996. Unsure what the community response would be, so high security was put in place (police snipers, helicopters, etc.) Pride Parade in Manhattan had been happening since 1969, and hadn’t had any issues Jackson Heights was chosen as the location of the parade because it already had gay bars and nightlife Queens Pride Parade is characterized as more “family friendly” than the Manhattan parade. Mr. Stein: “It’s pretty vanilla, in a sense.” Queens Pride Parade has marching bands, music, street fair One year, the parade faced some resistance from the Muslim community in Jackson Heights. Many other parades use the route down 37th avenue, so in some ways the Queens Pride Parade just feels like another one of the many parades that there are. 00:34:30 – 00:36:23 People who march in the parade each year: ACQC, marching bands, gay gymnasts, political groups, politicians, religious organizations Parade route: on 37th Ave, from 89th St. to 75th St. 00:36:23 – 00:38:20 Jackson Heights as a center of LGBTQ culture in Queens People in other neighborhoods also formed a group call “Out Astoria”, “Out Forest Hills”, and “Out Far Rockaway” Most gay bars are located in Jackson Heights and Astoria 00:38:20** – 00:43:10 On how LGBTQ community and activism in Queens differs from that of Manhattan Queens Pride Parade focuses on LGBTQ visibility/awareness, while the Manhattan pride march is more civil rights-oriented. Manhattan march is bigger, more risqué, political, receives more corporate sponsorship. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Queens Pride Parade, the Queens museum curated a special exhibit about the history of the parade 00:43:10 – 00:46:20 On working with the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens Daniel Dromm helped start a Queens chapter of PFLAG with founder Jean Manford, who lived in Queens. Daniel founded the LGDCQ in 1994 or 1995. The Club endorses and supports political candidates who support its agenda, which is to minimize discrimination against gay people. 00:46:20 – 00:48:24 On his career as a public school teacher Graduated from City College of New York in 1970, commuting from Jamaica From 1970 - 1991, taught math at a middle school in Brooklyn In 1991, transferred to Russel Sage Junior High School Retired from NYC public schools in 2002, after thirty-two years of teaching. Taught at Iowa State in the fall semesters of 2002, 2003 and 2004 while maintaining his Forest Hills residence. 00:48:24 – 00:50:47 Mr. Stein explains the relationship between him and his housemate, an international student from India (who had walked through the room earlier). 00:50:47 – 00:57:49 On NYC public school system’s attitude toward LGBTQ issues His students dealt with verbal taunts and mocking, but no physical violence. Many teachers, including Mr. Stein, did not come out to their students, or to their colleagues. Mr. Stein discusses growing up going to a Catholic school in Queens (Parsons St. and 79th Ave.) Attended Archbishop Malloy High School, and then City College. 00:57:49 – 00:59:49 On his faith and LGBTQ identity Attended Catholic school for grades 1-12. Catholic. Keeps his identity private; easy in a faith tradition that doesn’t stress fellowship and socializing. 00:59:49 – 01:02:25 Hopes for the future of the LGBTQ community in Queens Continue raising consciousness about the LGBTQ community, both locally and on a larger scale. “No hopes, dreams, or aspirations” “We’ve essentially won the battle in New York City, but we haven’t necessarily won the battle elsewhere”. 01:02:25 – 01: 02:56 End of Interview ",

  "Stokolosa_Clare_timecode.txt": "Zach: This is Zachary Ryan with Clare Stokolosa. It is November third, two-thousand and eighteen and we are in Long Island City. So, howdy doo Clare how are you? Clare: I’m good thank you, thank you for coming to my studio. This is studio thirty-four, I’m in room four-thirty-four in Long Island City and we’re on the Astoria side. Long Island City is made up of Astoria, Sunnyside and Long Island City Proper and the whole area is Long Island City, which can get a little confusing. But I grew up here and I now live in Bayside, Queens but I’m back, my friends said I came back because my studio is here. I am a homemade Queens girl, born and raised in Queens. I was born in Boulevard Hospital on Fourty-Third Street and I think Fourty-Third Avenue which is now an apartment building, oh well. And I think it’s a fancy apartment building, and I grew up on Thirty-Third Street off of Broadway. It was a, and it is, but it was a very tight knit community, we played out on the street, there was the drugstore up the block that sold candy and we ran a credit there so that would be paid off at the end of, ya know, the pay period, ya know they’d run a bill or run a tab, and then ya know my parents would go and pay it off, ya know it was very different than it is now, ya know, pre-credit card, I guess, I imagine there weren’t credit cards, there may have been. And, I was, my my earliest memory, is being in my apartment on Thirty-Third Street and we had French windows that looked out onto the street and, they’re like doors, basically French windows are doors. And we were in the front and we had back windows too, and I just remember my mother sitting by the window putting her makeup on with the natural light, and I also remember her just looking outside, and, watching the light. And when the, watching the light shift to our side of the street and at a certain hour, closer to noon she would let me go out and play, because ya know then you could go out and play, by yourselves with your friends. And, I just remember the shifts in the light through the, the sunlight going the fire escapes and how it would cast different shadows on the building, and, buildings, and its very urban here, so it’s all brick buildings and how it fascinated me and I was always very fascinated with light. And I realized that later on in my painting and in my, my work colors that I have this fascination for light. There was one house on our block, it belonged to the Presbyterian Church, and it had a yard, and we would go there, the kids would go down there and play, and get chased out of the yard, that was our yard. But basically there were alley ways, there was Cats Alley where, ya know, people would feed the cats and lots of stray cats. And it was just a fun place, we played stick ball in the street it was a fun place to be. But I always did my art, I was always fascinated with my art. My parents, my father was from Polish-Ukrainian descent. And he grew up on the Lower East Side and he’s, his family’s the one that brought us to Astoria. When he was, and my mother I’ll just mention was from Italian, her, my grandparents on my mom’s side are from Italy from Southern Italy, and they lived in the Bronx. But my father growing up on Tenth and First Avenue in Manhattan went away to, what was like the fresh air (inaudible) now, but it was called, it was a little different it was like a camp for underprivileged children. And he came back and he was about ten eleven years old, I think he was like ten, and his parents weren’t in the house anymore. And the super had a note with the address on it and said, “Your parents moved to Astoria, and here, you take the train and this is how you get there,” and this is before cell phones and a very different place and imagine a little kid coming home and his parents aren’t there and he has to find this place and it was crazy, ya know like take this long train ride on the subway and he did, and they wound up staying here. My grandparents had a small, like a, like a little diner, dinette, with another partner and so my grandfather was a chef and he sort of came here and started that business. And I don’t remember it, I don’t remember I never met my grandfather. But it was right I think on Thirty-Fourth Avenue which is an avenue away from where we live, it was either Thirty-First or Thirty-Fourth I’m not sure. So we were just kind of in, ya know, my, my father was raised here. He went to school at IS, I-S which is Intermediate School One-Twenty-Six on Twenty-First Street, between Broadway and Thirty-First Avenue, beautiful building, built in the twenties, and he was the first graduating class in eighth grade. And it just so happens that my first year of teaching art, I got a job teaching at One-Twenty-Six, and, so it was kind of incredible I remember bringing in the, the graduation picture to show my principal because it was just coincidence it wasn’t planned or anything, but it was very interesting. A real inner-city school, at the time rough, it was a real eye-opener, I loved every minute of it I loved my students. We would, I would have, I had this big beautiful classroom that overlooked, you could see the city you could see the bridges. And I would have my, and it had beautiful wooden floors and high ceilings. And I would have my students sketch out the window, not hang out the window but sit by the ledge and do observational drawing. And just so happens that for me it was very reminiscent because I went to Art & Design High School in the city. So I would cross over to Manhattan over the bridge which is just, ya know, it’s like fifteen minutes … to go to school. And I would do the same thing, ya know, when I was in high school we would sketch out the window and and do observational drawings of Manhattan (inaudible) Manhattan, and so it was like that bridge that connection, the waterways, always being surrounded by water. And right now I live in Bayside and we’re right by the water too, so there’s something about the light in New York. And being in Queens and where I live in Queens I was always at the water’s edge, by Astoria Park which is right here which is right along the East River, always by water, and that’s what I really love about New York and where I live in Queens. And I remember, I’m in Bayside now, I don’t mean to skip around, but I live near Fort Totten and my father was in World War II and he was, he lost his arm during D-Day. And, so, this is a little sad but it’s good, and, so he got to go to the Commissary at Fort Totten, so I remember as a kid going to Fort Totten which is this beautiful base, army base, that goes back to the Civil War. And I remember going there and he would do shopping, like it was very inexpensive and it was pretty, we’d drive there. And he had this big green kind of bubbly round car, I don’t know (inaudible) Chevrolet or what it was. And it was like kind of like an automatic, where you put the money in and then they would put the food through on the other side and you would open the little plastic door and to me that was like, that’s all I wanted, that’s all I wanted to get to do that and pull out the little piece of pie or whatever so, that was fascinating but. And now I live in Bayside and I go to that park and I’ve done paintings there, so it’s just like this, these these, overlapping things that have happened to me and where I wind up in my, ya know, in my life. But my mom, mom being from the Bronx, my father being in the army and losing his arm, with LaGuardia when he was, ya know you think of LaGuardia Airport but Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor, someone knew him. And knew, someone that my father knew or my grandparents knew, knew Fiorello LaGuardia, who was the mayor or New York, and knew he was starting a veterans administration in the city. And it was really to help men who were, people who were wounded to get back to their lives, ya know, and get them out of bed, get them from their depression. So my father was hired to work at the VA, I don’t know if it was a hospital but it was a center. And he worked to like, go and and try and help people get back on their feet, ya know, literally and figuratively. And my mom in those days there were phone operators, like with the switch boards and you move the wire and you would connect people. So actually my father before he even knew what he was saying, he would say, “I met your ma, your mother online,” ya know how like you say you meet someone online and you meet someone on the computer, well before that he always would say, “I met your mother online she was the operator.” So it’s kind of a different reference but the same. And he asked her out and she was from the Bronx, so that’s how they met and when they got married, in the Bronx, they wound up moving and living in in Queens and living with my grandparents, so it was a little tough on my mother. And then there was the Fuller Brush Man, so the Fuller Brush Man used to sell things, go door to door sell soap and brushes and things for the house and products. And he told my mother that there was an apartment opening up around the corner so that’s when they found out, that was their connection and they moved, it was a double building where we lived and then we wound up getting a bigger apartment when the rest of us, its five siblings, I mean I have four, I have a brother and three sisters but there were five children. So we got a bigger apartment and it was a five-story walkup, we lived on the first floor thank God and our windows were right there, my mother, everyone’s always out the window and we had the wash lines in the back hanging the wash out in the back and I remember even when they had it on the roof where you could hang the wash, I guess that’s a, ya know, fire code hazard now so don’t do that anymore. But was a really close-knit neighborhood, all the kids played we played in the hallway, we played outside, we played tag and stick ball. There were lots of stores, that were like individual mom-and-pop stores, there was the German deli and then the Italian delis and the pizza place. We use to go to the movie theaters, there were three movie theaters, two on Steinway, one was a Lowes and there was the Strand and we’d go to the matinee and just, on a Saturday or Sunday and buy popcorn and bon-bons little ice cream bon-bons and it was all kids and crazy and noisy and we watched like a, a movie and, a cartoon and that’s what we did, I’m sure it was inexpensive. And then we’d go to the pizza place and the pizza places were like a long counter and then there was an outside window that would lift up and they’d cut a slice from a big pie and then put it on a piece of like paper and like throw it, ya know, not really but kind of like throw it at you. And then you’d get like a little tiny Coke, ya know, not like what we think of as these big sodas, ya know, and it was twenty-five cents, I remember twenty-five cents. And it was delicious, it was so good. All the food was, ya know, all the food was so good and there were different ethnic, it was mostly I guess Irish, Irish-Catholic, there was Jewish. There was Italian, Spanish, there was blacks but it was I would say it was segregated because of the projects, we have a lot of projects. And I don’t think it was, I I was too little but I’m gonna say it, ya know, that it probably was, ya know, like most of the, African Americans were in the projects, there were several projects, they were mixed. And, ya know, the demographics have changed over time definitely, it’s just always maintained neighborhood. Ya know, whoever’s living here it’s just great, it’s, ya know, now present day one of my sister’s still lives here and, I mean I love it here and everyone wants to move here, but I love it it still keeps that family sense to it which I really like and that little bit of hometown and when the different groups come in different ethnic groups they bring that flavor in, that food in, that’s what it’s just, it's always been known for, ya know, that original food, ya know, change and then it was Greek and Muslim and from different like, whether it’s Indian, the food’s changed but you could get whatever kind of food you want and it’s authentic, it’s delicious. And my, but going back to me, my memory, again, was just playing outside and being home with my mom and she was Italian, always cooking, she would make dough and she would give me dough, and I would make little sculptures, I was always making my art. My sister’s tell me how I use to just sketch, like sketch objects, sketch the telephone, sketch anything I could, watch tv, sketch the tv. Ya know I have vague memories of that and I know I was always tracked for art, in the first grade, I I went to Most Precious Blood, which was a Catholic school through eighth grade, then I went to Art & Design public school in Manhattan where I crossed the bridge, which I thought was always part of my life crossing this bridge, the Fifty-Ninth Street or Queensboro Bridge. And just always had art in my life, I was tracked for art, my first grade teacher said, “She needs glasses and she’s a good artist, I don’t know how smart she is,” no but those are the two things she said and I’m still wearing my glasses and I’m still doing my art, and I just have this need to always do my art. But I just always fascinated with light, and color and paint, I think it’s because I didn’t see well, that I always saw color first and then I would see form and then I would see the line, the line was last. So, so we’re right outside the very noisy street so it’s a part of the neighborhood. And so I was just fascinated always with color and just always loved making things and whether it was three-dimensional out of clay or painting I just always remember painting. My mom had me like set up my paints in the middle of the living room with the rug and the plastic-covered furniture and a little table and I was painting away, but I just always, I always loved it. And, it was, I just, I love living here, I love living here and doing my art and one thing is I live by the trains, so I was right off of Broadway and we had the R-Train and the N-Train. And now they switched so what you think of as the R, is now on the N-Line and the N is on the R-Line, but that doesn’t matter, if you live here, they did switch so the train, the letters for the train switched and the R was originally on the L-Train and this is actually a painting that I did, this is from the L, of someone on the L-Train. And the L means elevated train because we have an L-Line that runs through Fourteenth Street and to Brooklyn, but when I say the L, it means elevated train it’s short for elevated train. And the other line was underground which is the subway, and that was always there so that’s was our form of travel, always took the trains everywhere. And the bus, actually there was a Steinway bus and it went right to Fifty-Ninth Street and stopped last stop two blocks from my high school, so made going to school in Manhattan real easy. So I could take the train, I’d meet my friends on the train or I could take the bus, my girlfriend Irene would meet me by the bus and we’d say, “Okay let’s take the bus today.” And so that was really always cool and convenient. And going, ya know, I went to a Catholic school, my father, it was Most Precious Blood, I know my father helped fundraise to build that school which is now closed a few years ago. And it was great, it was a little stifling cuz I’m I was an artist so wearing a uniform, ya know, but it was great we had, ya know, a lot of tradition and the church it was a good place. I just liked a little more freedom than wearing my uniform because I wanted to be more expressive but otherwise, ya know, it was good. And I remember, ya know, I especially remember the teachers that were really interested in art and we always did a little more extra art projects. And I always wanted to do my, of course my art homework first, you know when I would get home it was like, “Oh I have this,” and my mother say, “Well what about,” “I wanna do this first, I wanna do this first,” so I was always doing my art. And I remember the people in my life who always brought me art like my friend who lived on my block, my friend Debbie, and I had more than one friend Debbie, but the younger one and her aunt was an artist so I did my first oil painting at her aunt’s house. She set us up and she lived in one of the newer buildings that had on, on Crescent Street and it had a patio and ya know it was probably built in the sixties and she set us up with a little easel and the paint tubes and that’s the first time I ever used oil paint and I remember I painted a tree with a squirrel on it. And I remember like after that no painting my mother’s vases, and just like objects in my house and I just got my own oil paints and I never stopped, I never stopped. And then my brother, who was older than I was, had friends that went to Art & Design in the city on Fifty-Seventh Street and Second Avenue, specialized high school. And I took the test and I got in, and it was life-changing so ya know, the hoop earrings, the babushka that my grandmother use to use, I wore the scarf around my head and now it was, that means scarf, and ya know I was ya know I loved that freedom and we got a really strong great, my friends and I got art education, very strong based. And it’s a wonderful, it’s just been rebuilt it’s in Manhattan and it was just rebuilt and it’s just around the corner now so they bought the airspace so it was low so now there’s a big high rise and in exchange they built a beautiful state-of-the-art school. So actually I won an art award as an art teacher award and it was presented at Art & Design, cuz they had the conference there so it was very special to me. I taught art for many years, and I have my BFA, my Bachelor’s of Fine Art degree, and from Hunter College, which was right across the bridge, on Sixty-Eighth Street and Lexington Avenue, again, just taking the bus, moved to Sunnyside there was another bus that just went the Q-Sixty(?) that went all along Queens Boulevard and stopped, ya know, on Sixtieth Street and then I’d just walk uptown to Sixty-Eighth so that was my form of transportation really buses and trains. And I have this fascination with light and trains and train tracks, and I talked about the light and the fire escapes, I also lived by the L, the elevated train and you’d see like the train would pull in and pull out and as it did it would change the light as it would go over the tracks and it would cast these shadows and you’d hear that click-click-click-click-click-click-click, click-click-click noise and so it’d pass by and it was fascinating to me, it wasn’t noise it was like a melody, ya know, it was just like, it was like a song. And I remember, and I have my whole series, ya know I did all my sketches I call it “New York City Faces of the New York City Subway” and people on the subway and people in transit, that I’ve, that I’ve worked on. And actually that’s, jumping around a little bit, but I just did that I was teaching an art history class up town in Washington Heights and on my way to work I was in Bayside so it was a long train ride I was on the LIRR to Thirty-Fourth Street and Penn and then I take the one up town and or the A, and just everywhere, no matter where I was everyone’s just on their devices, everyone was on their phones it’s a different world than when I was little. And I said, “What’s going on, ya know, so I said I’m going to document this,” so I started, I always sketch, I sketched when I was in high school I always sketched. And, so I started drawing them and I enlarged them and I did a whole series of paintings on them. But always that fascination with the subway, with transportation, bridges, getting passage ways back and forth, getting across waterways because again I was surrounded by water and I was always fascinated with that. And a little bit of an activist, there was a very old building, school on Steinway Street right off of Broadway and it must have been built at the turn of the last century or before, maybe sometime in the eighteen hundreds and when it came down the community was trying to get a park built, so we would go there, we were just kids, like ten and the girl scouts would go, I wasn’t a girl scout but I would go with them and we just would like try and clean up this huge massive lot and we would like take bricks and make this huge massive pile to make a statement and we built this huge mound that must’ve been, like a story high. And we wound up getting a park, half of it was a park and half of it is a parking lot and is still there, the parking lot and the park are right off on Steinway between Broadway and Thirty-First, so we did get something accomplished. And we did fight, I remember when I was a child we had the movie theater, and Lowes was this big beautiful old movie theater and it had like the king’s chair with the crushed velvet, red, and very gaudy, and it had like the big balconies with all the stairways leading up and you’d go and sit in the king’s chair and your feet would dangle and I remember people were fighting to keep, to keep the theater from being destroyed and they did not succeed. And they also were doing a petition because of cable tv, we didn’t want to pay for tv, so this was so I guess I had a little bit of activism and neighborhood activism in me and I’ve always tried to do what’s right for the community, very active in my union, I was an art teacher for many years and always trying, like wanting to give back and I guess it came from when I was young, I had that in me. Zach: Is there anything else that you, that, of this area that has really affected your life? Clare: The life that, this is a very urban area, and I grew up on Broadway, which is where all the stores are, there’s (inaudible) and there’s Broadway, the Steinway Street, there are certain avenues that have most of the stores. And, I, I would say just being surround, like being in a hub, I need that energy. I go to Italy and I stay in a town that has that kind of life to it even though it’s small, and I go back and forth with my art career. But I love home, the, the, the little the mom-and-pop stores that were along Broadway, I love the restaurants that are here. We really didn’t go out to eat much, there were certain restaurants my mother was very particular where she went to eat and she was an incredible cook, everyone like if they talk about my mother they talk about her meatballs she was an incredible cook. And very very kind person, open door. Living in an apartment building with the people would like talk to each other through the window or come in and out of each other’s homes, like open door, and I don’t know if that was because of my family but everyone was super friendly. So having all the stores, but also having that small sense of community really stayed with me. Ya know, that friendliness, that safeness. I love stores I love shopping I love touching things, ya know, forget the Internet, ya know, I just, I just love that, the noises, the smells, on Sundays, ya know, people cooking and being in, ya know, as a kid we would like wander through the back alleys, I guess we did a lot of dangerous things, ya know. And just hearing that mumbling of the sounds and the cooking and the aromas of the cooking of the different, ya know, like, different smells from whoever was cooking, I talked about the different ethnic groups so you’d, you’d smell it and just hearing that kind of quiet, because it was a busy area, but on Sundays, everything closed on Sunday. And that was really special, and I remember when I first went to Italy and I was in Florence and it was a Sunday and I was walking through the streets and it brought me back to that time because I heard those same sounds, ya know. And it was interesting because my mom was Italian so there was that kind of, and ya know I guess there were a lot of Italians in the area then, different groups but. Just, I remember the our school had a big parking lot and in the once a year they may had a Bizarre, we had the Ferris wheel and we had like, where you would, ya know, the the wheel, spin the wheel and you could place a bet, and little rides and that was like incredible like everyone, “We gotta go, we gotta go to the Bizarre.” So that was like all these big things these were events, when I grew up and when I was going to school when I was really young, there was a chicken coop across the street on Broadway from my school and you’d see the, I’m sure, I didn’t know they were ringing their necks but there were little chickens walking around on Broadway. To me they were like pets, and, ya know, it just, just we had the trip to the moon and and the whip, those were rides that would come down our street, they were like on a, on a cart and you’d pay ten cents and you’d get to go on this ride. And, ya know, Mister Softy(?) and the sound of Mister Softy(?) and the Good Humor bell. Ya know there was a lot more, I remember, I remember when I was really little, home with my mother looking out the window, there was a woman who use to come and sing like opera songs, and she was dressed like, ya know, with the shawl and she had the, the scarf tied up on her head and she’d come in the alley way and she’d sing opera, and my mom would wrap a, the back alley our window was higher, in the front it was lower, and my mother would put money in like a little tissue and I’d get to throw it down to her and I’d peek out the window and that was like, incredible. Like I didn’t realize how much music was and sounds were in my life, and I’m talking now and I’m realizing it. And then I remember the Junk Man use to come, and he had a truck and he’d come down and go, “Alley-o-Junk, Alley-Whack, Any ol’ Junk” and he was scary-looking, I don’t know if he had many teeth and was kind of scraggly and he’d always come back the window and like wave at me, and I’d kind of hide cuz I guess I was home, ya know, my my siblings, I have one younger sibling my sister Annie but my, Maryann, Teresa, Peter they were out at school and so I was home with my mom a lot so she definitely influenced me a lot. And ya know it was the age of tv and all the sitcoms, and, I loved tv, I am an avid read but I, that wasn’t till later on, I always did my art. I don’t know whether influence of art, my mother was always so good at it, the food always looked so beautiful, she always decorated beautifully. My aunt on my father’s side wanted to be a seam-, ya know, a seamstress but, a fashion designer but I don’t think, I think that was kind of taboo. My father, he, he used to go in to Broadway and, to there’s a bar right it’s still there I don’t know what it’s called now and listen to Tony Bennett. And I actually met Tony Bennett, at an awards ceremony, ya know, because he’s very pro for these specialized high schools that are, are in danger now and they’re very very important. They’re, they’re throughout the boroughs, they’re for all different subjects and they’re trying to get rid of them and they’re so vital and important. But I met him at, and he’s so kind and I went over to him and I told him that my father use to go and listen to him, and he, I don’t know if it was true but he goes, “Those were some of the best times in my life,” when he was starting his career he was such a nice man. And like Ethel Merman lived, ya know, like, I think Rosemary from the Dick Van Dyke Show went to school, they went to Bryant High School, my father went to Manhattan to school, to high school, but my aunt went to Bryant High School. And a lot of people who are, ya know, wound up being famous went to school there a lot of them came out of Astoria, I don’t know why but. And we all kind of stayed, ya know, had my family in the Bronx, ya know, it’s funny New York is, is kind of very worldly and very provincial. So I know a lot of people moved to New York but a lot of my friends that were born and raised here are like our families are here, like we stay, like I’m in, ya know, I’m really in Queens my other family is in the Bronx some people have moved away but, people kind of stay close. So there is, ya know, we have, there is the wrong impression about New York because there is close-knit community here. There’s like this inner smaller community and people are friendly, they might be rough, but they really are helpful and friendly, ya just have to, I have friends that come here from Italy and they don’t speak English and (inaudible) trying to communicate and they were like trying to order a coffee it was in Manhattan and it’s like, “What, what do you want. What do you want.” and she’s like “Oh my God” she was trying, she didn’t know what to do it was just funny, it was comical. But really can be helpful you just have to get past that. But I would just say that like there’s something about Long Island City, I mean there’s some reason why everyone’s coming back here, I mean it’s getting very expensive. It’s sad to see all the high rises that are going up, there’s so many, I mean I hope they do family, I hope they do planning for schools and sewers and hospitals, so many hospitals have closed. The hospital I was born in, Saint John’s Hospital, on Queens Boulevard down by Woodhaven. I mean we need hospitals, we need to plan for schools, we need to plan in every which way, ya know, it’s a, we have to have, not just putting up buildings and factories, ya know, and when I say factories, I grew up, there were all factories here the Swingline(?) factory for the stapler, I grew up with, there were a lot of factories here and a lot of manufacturing in Long Island City but now when I say factories I mean they’re just putting up all these high rises and I hope they think of urban planning, and what they’re going, ya know, and saving and saving some of that community because a lot of, a lot of communities throughout Queens are being shut down. Like in Kew Gardens there, there’s a whole little neighborhood and that land was leased by the railroad and all those stores were told they have to leave and they’re going to be putting up high rises there. So like, it’s nice to bring people in, but then where are they going to shop, and where are they going to eat and, ya know, we have to think of those changes and I, I hope, I just want to say like with my art, I hope, I always had my art it always brought peace and energy to me, I want to express things that are good and happy and I want to use it as a window, in a, a window in and out and I hope I keep doing that with my art. And I hope that people just stay aware and are involved in their community. Zach: Do you see yourself ever leaving this area for somewhere else? Clare: I love, I live part of the time in Cortona in Tuscany in Italy, I can never leave New York completely, it is too much, I mean I, I always tell her, I used to tell my students and I, even when I, I worked with art teachers and as a mentor and, and doing professional development for the city but, I, I don’t like to use the word “never,” but I can’t imagine totally leaving New York, and I guess, ya know I always wanted to, ya know when I was younger I was kind of embarrassed that I lived in Astoria it was like blue collar, I always looked I’d go in Manhattan and I’d look at all the big buildings and wanted to live there. And actually, recently before I moved to Bayside I thought about it, and I looked and I wound up moving to Bayside which to me use to be the country, it was so far away, but I remember I use to go to the Commissary there, so it’s like, ya know, going back and forth to these neighborhoods these little triangles, and I don’t, I don’t think I could ever leave New York and leave Queens. And one other thing that’s very funny is I’m in Bayside by Fort Totten and it’s by another bridge, it’s by the Throgs Neck Bridge, which is right across from my aunt’s house and they live right on the water there, always surrounded by water we use to go to the Bronx, we use to swim in the East River all the time. And my cousin told me that she use to rowboat across to the, the shore in Bayside and, and, pick up her friend in the rowboat in Queens … that was my phone, and, technology times have changed … and rowboat across back to the Bronx. But there’s like kind of that triangle, ya know, like I had a lot of friends in Brooklyn, always in Manhattan, cuz always the East Side mostly, because it’s right across the river. But I just, I can’t imagine ever leaving here. My grandparents are in Calgary Cemetery on Queens Boulevard, my family and my grandparents are in the Bronx in Saint Raymonds. And I’m very nostalgic I really hold onto things and, ya know I don’t know, we’ll see, I hope to spend more time in Italy and I love it there, but I think it’s because it holds some of the town I stay in, holds some of the qualities what has a lot of culture, has a lot of the arts, they appreciate my art there, which is good, it has, it has what this neighborhood offers. So the friendliness also the culture, but I, ya know I taught in Queens, I taught art in Queens, my studio’s in Long Island City, I taught in Corona, Queens, I taught in Glendale, Queens which I didn’t even know where it was until I got, I taught, I taught in Astoria, my first gig teaching. And ya know it’s like I was raised here I went to school here ya know, I went to school, ya know, for in Manhattan but this is like where I am, I live here, probably die here. Zach: Do you enjoy making your art based on things that you see here? Clare: Yes, I, I always, I’m very influenced by, I’m very influenced by the architecture, the light. And one of my favorite paintings is Edward Hopper’s “Sunday Morning,” and it’s, it’s of a, there’s like a, a barber shop pole with the stripes on it it’s like red and white, in the picture and some old storefronts with a old façade of buildings. And I swear to God that’s what it looked like right around up the block from where I live. That’s, it looked exactly, there was the barber shop, there was a little grocery store, there were a few buildings. And I, I’m very influenced by the architecture and the light in Manhattan and, and in Queens and in my neighborhood and the trains and, ya know, the, the tenements which are disappearing and the high rises and the bridges going up. Yeah, I’m just so, my view is always of Manhattan because I’m on the, the Queens side. But I’m very influenced by the people, I sketch the people, I paint them. I try to, to keep that in my life and use it as my art is a form of communication. What’s funny is, my phone was ringing which is on my wrist because it’s a watch and I feel like Agent Ninety-Nine, you probably don’t know who Agent Ninety-Nine is from a tv show, from Maxwell Smart, but when I was a kid they had phone books, there was the white pages and the yellow pages, and they use to have original art, not original art but images and one of them was “Sunday Morning” by Hopper. And you could send away and I got this free poster of that scene, and I framed it, the way I could frame it I was just a kid and I’ll put it up in the room, in, in my brother’s bedroom cuz I, I didn’t have my own room I shared with my sisters but I use to decorate his room. And I remember going to the Whitney and they did a show on him and they had his, his easel and they had that painting on it and it was the most incredible thing. But I love his cuz he really deals with light, Hopper, he’s one of my favorite artists. And, and the light and the city and the scenes, and when I draw whether I’m in Italy or whether I’m here I like to take in the architecture, the people and the life around me. I’m fascinated with it. Zach: So you mentioned that you’re fascinated by people and the life, are there any noticeable differences that you’ve noticed between life and culture here versus overseas? Clare: They, in, in Italy I would say that they’re slower, and I mean that in a positive way. They appreciate living more, just enjoying, ya know, they, they go to work, they work very hard they have, they still have like the long lunches the siestas, everything still, it does close down, there are some places where it doesn’t but basically places close down, then they go back to work in the evening, they go home and they hang out and in the cities it’s changing a little bit, but they go home, they relax and then they go back to work and everything opens back up around four five o’clock it’s like incredible. Like everything just like, so it’s like okay it’s hot, or okay it’s this or that and they go home and they do their shopping or they do whatever and then they go back and they open up things. I remember I was in Italy last summer I, I go several times a year and often in the summer, and I was, I always do my walk in, it’s a walled city, it’s a Truskan-walled city(?), ya know Renaissance it goes all the way back, and this is Cortona. And I always do my walk around the mountain and I was walk, and I end up back in the park and there were these women walking their dogs in front of me. And I was thinking about work, I was thinking about my artwork and a painting I was doing, and how I was going to solve the problem but it was actually, as much as I love my work it was a little stressful because I was trying to solve, ya know, painting isn’t just when you’re in front of the canvas, there’s a lot that goes into my art, ya know, thinking it through, the concept. And so I was like, all of a sudden I was like (big groan sound) ya know, I took, I was like, I had like this deep breath and they turned around, Italian, and I speak, ya know, some Italian and they turned around and were like, “What’s wrong,” ya know, what’s the matter and I said, “Oh, I’m thinking about work,” and they said, “Well don’t think.” It’s like in otherwise not not to think but (inaudible) intelligent people but relax, they enjoy life. I, I think New York is a little, as much as I do love it the pace when I get back, the pace is a little fast. Ya know, well I love it and I miss it, I guess as I get older, that’s why I like to spend, I, I think of Italy as like my Florida, a lot of people in New York go to Florida, they snowbird, I want Italy to be my Florida but my husband says it’s a little further than Florida but, we go quite often. Zach: Is he here in Queens with you? Clare: Yes, we live together. We got married a few years ago in Cortona in the town. And he loves it there, he’s from Italian descent also, and on his father’s side, and he loves the life there. His mother’s also from the south, like from Alabama here. So it’s like, from being from Southern Italy and having, and from being, he has, it’s almost like that’s what the pace is like, they’re more southern in Italy like, ya know, like southern here. They’re slower, except Rome is different but, ya know, they have that pace that, “Ah, yeah take it easy sit down for a while,” ya know, ya chat first, your not just like. Sometimes when I’m the, when I’m at the gallery and I deal (inaudible), ya know he runs the gallery and sometimes I’ll ask him about something he says “Tranquillo, tranquillo,” you’re not in New York, relax. You’re in Italy please, you’re not in New York don’t be in New York. So I have that pace in me and I have to learn to like, chill. Zach: I was going to say, which pace do you feel like you have more of? Clare: Well I do have that, that, I have that, that, you know, especially, you know when I was teaching art and I was on the schedule and in the public schools and I was always an advocate, always joining programs involved in, outreaching and getting involved with the museums, it’s a lot of work, you know. So, looking for things and my principals always supported me but it, I had to do like the footwork and then say, “How bout this” and they were like, “Well can you make it work?” and you know, “We’re behind you,” you know, I was lucky that way I was very fortunate. And it was always for the kids, ya know, but I, I, I love that, but I think as I get older, ya know, slowing down a little bit. And I made, I just recently made the decision to do my art full-time, I always did my art, even when I taught art I was always a, a working artist. But to do it full time it, and to just, ya know, put myself into that and share my art, help other people who want to find this journey of, ya know, being an artist full-time and also giving back to the community, which ya know is also very important to me. So, ya know, you learn the pace, it’s like a dance, it’s like a dance. Zach: What do you hope people take away from your art? Clare: I hope they’re inspired, I hope it brings them a smile. Happiness, and insight at the same time. I did, I had a show called “Le Donne(?),” and it means “women” in Italian, and I did it, it was at a college in the city, at (inaudible) College, and it was all women, all the images. Except actually this painting, you can’t really see it, but this painting was in it. And this is actually of someone I knew from Italy, it was a boyfriend who came here, because a lot migrated here to make a living. And this is the L-Train on Broadway. And I have a painting of me on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, and it’s all about bridges and passageways, so I want my art to be a window, a bridge, an opening. And in the show it was all women and their different roles. And, and these, if you ever look at an old building in Italy they’ll have like two (inaudible), and in other countries too they’ll have like, the gargoyles or the lions and a lot of times they’ll have people bearing fruit, like as greeting people coming into a big palazzo or big building. And so I had these two framing as you entered the gallery, and then I had all the people in Noah’s Lover, his Mother, you know, as sibling in their different roles and that’s what the show was based on. And I remember one kid looked at this picture, and he was Spanish, it was blonde, it was like a woman with a blonde baby blue eyes, and he looked at it and he says, “Oh my God that reminds me of me and my mother,” and that’s it, that’s what I want my art to do. I don’t want it to be like, “That’s not me” or “I can’t relate to that,” I want it to create, I want it to move people, I want them to, I want it to be whether you’re looking at people on the subway, I want people to identify and relate to it, and what better way through art. And I thought New York City, the subway in New York City you get all kind of, I know I’m jumping around, but you get every walk of life, you have the homeless, you have people travelling from all around the world on the subway, you have people with lots of money taking the subway, the mayor takes the subway, you have, ya know, people who have to share a metro card because they, they can’t afford another metro card and they have to meet and I know this, from, from experience from people I know that they have to meet someone at the station to get that metro card because they can’t afford to get another one and share the metro card back-and-forth to work and school. So you have all kinds of walks of life on the subway. And it’s a, we live in harmony on the subway, I know you hear a lot of bad things but really, how many people are on the train, how many masses of people are on the train living peacefully, I want to capture that in my art. I want my art to speak about peace, about communication and I want it to bring a smile. Zach: What advice would you give people who are looking to follow in your footsteps or enter this field? Clare: It’s hard. It’s fun. You have to have the passion. You have to believe. And just go for it, just keep pounding the sidewalk, ya know, there’s more, there’s more to it than just, if you want to just make your art and have it and keep it intimate for yourself and your family, that’s good. If you want to go beyond that, know what you want, define what you want and it may change, go back and look at that over time. Be open, share with people, share with, don’t be like, “I need this all for myself,” I learned from a lot of people, and I, ya know, pass it on. It’s just a lot of work, be determined, be organized, ya know, as an artist ya know, what kind of, I can speak for myself, I’m kind of like all over there. But I think my teacher training helped to keep me solid and keep me together. It’s just like, follow your dream, and, and, ya know, don’t give up. Zach: Is there anything else you would like to add? Clare: This was very emotional. Zach: Did you have fun with it? Clare: Yeah. Zach: You seemed to enjoy it. Clare: Yeah, it was very emotional and probably didn’t talk about a lot of things … It was a lot of fun … A lot of stories … Just thinking back, my family, friends, ya know I didn’t mention a lot of people by name or anything but, ya know, just like my, the connections like, having all these siblings and they had friends and the extended families and. One thing I want to mention, growing up there was the telephone. We use to lock ourselves in the big closet and talk on the phone, I remember my father pounding telling my sister get off the phone. But what is lost, and this is important, what has been lost is through having a telephone in the house, everyone got to knew, to know their parents’ friends, even if it was via telephone. You would pick up the phone, you’d have a little conversation, you’d pass it on. You would talk, you would know who your brother’s friends were from that, you would know who to call at a certain time, you’d know your father’s friends, your mother’s friends. They knew, they knew, it was, it was more sharing of people, and now it’s great that we have our private phones and we can reach each other so quickly. But we’ve lost that, that community, by so, there’s always give and take, by having these phones which I did the study drawing people on the phone, we don’t share as much. So we have to try and keep that balance, and speak to people, look at people, I draw them so I look at them. So many times I catch them when they find me drawing them but they rarely catch me drawing them, cuz they’re always like this. And just we need to keep community, and, and because communication will bring us peace, and fear, and hatred, and thinking people are different is only going to divide us and is not going to lead to good things. So just be opened, opened to new things and don’t be afraid. Zach: Alright … Thank you for your time, Clare. This is Zachary Ryan and Clare Stokolosa, November third, two-thousand-eighteen, from Long Island City. Clare: Thank you, Zachary. Zach: Thank you. ",

  "Stone_Neal_timecode.txt": "Neal Stone is a third-generation Canadian. He talks about the important values of community engagement and contributing to the community he learned from his four grandparents as well as his parents. He moved to Manhattan in 1998 as an urban planner, after receiving a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Canada and working on human rights issues in the Philippines. His work as a NYC urban planner has helped him understand many of the infrastructure and political issues facing Queens and the rest of the City. Neal lived in Manhattan and Brooklyn before he moved to Jackson Heights in 2006. He loves living in Jackson Heights because of its LGBT culture as well as the vast diversity of the community. He has been very involved in the Queens Pride Committee and the Queens Pride Lions Club. Neal talks a lot about ‘jumping into new adventures” - starting college, going to the Philippines, and moving to NYC from a small town in Canada. 00:01:16 Neal has lived in Jackson Heights for 11 years, loves living here, and might wind up being here forever. But 30 years ago, this was the last place on the map he thought he would be. 00:01:43 Neal grew up in small town in east central Saskatchewan: Kamsack. This area was originally settled in 1880’s. 00:03:17 There was a mass exodus of eastern Europeans to this area in late 1880’s. His maternal great grandparents came from Eastern Europe. His paternal great grandparents were Norwegian and British. 00:05:04 His paternal grandfather was a postal service worker; his grandmother was an RN. His mother’s family was from an agricultural background. They homesteaded the land. These are big families with lots of cousins. This grandmother later became a health care worker and his grandfather became a handyman/carpenter. His grandparents were great role models, believing in neighborhood, community service, and community development. 00:07:31 Neal’s parents were both public school teachers and were high school sweethearts. 00:08:36 Neal talked about the level of commitment his parents had to the well-being of their students. As he grew older, he appreciated how much love and energy goes into teaching and has tremendous respect for his parents and the public- school system. He now understands the challenges and hardships faced by educators in the public-school system. 00:10:30 Because of his grandparents and parents, both he and his sister chose activities and careers that brought them to community betterment. 00:11:09 Neal went to college in the 1990’s. He started at the University of Manitoba. He thought he would be an architect, then a landscape architect. He got his degree, but was still not sure what he wanted to do. He did a variety of jobs, gained experience living in a bigger city, and was involved in political campaigns. He was still not sure about a career. 00:14:54 Neal started a Masters’ Degree program at the University of Winnipeg in Public Administration but that didn’t quite fit either. He was active in the Royal Air Cadets in high school, which focused on learning to fly a plane, leadership building, and commitment to the community. Between this BA and MA, he acted as an instructor for younger cadets. 00:19:44 He was advised to try a City Planning program at University of Manitoba. He registered for the Masters of City Planning program – just to see if he would like it. 00:20:53 Neal enjoyed the classmates in this program. They were from diverse places and experiences. They became very close. He caved into peer pressure and became a full-time student and more committed to the profession. All his fellow students became professional colleagues and long-term friends, who keep nurturing his work. 00:23:34 After he graduated with his master’s degree, Neal wanted to travel overseas. He wanted to do some cross-cultural work before settling in as a city planner. 00:25:28 He talked with his local minister about oversees work with the United Church of Christ. 00:27:00 He decided to go to the Philippines. There was a position open for environmental education which he felt was relevant to his education. When he got there, the environmental education position did not exist. He was offered a human rights position and decided to give it a try. 00:28:28 It was a great experience. Neal was excited about the people, made new friends, and learned a new language and culture. He stayed a year and a half. 00:29:13 He left the Philippines as a new person – an enhanced student of the world, experiencing globalization, cultural diversity and richness. He talked about it being a metamorphic experience. 00:30:30 After the Philippines, Neal went back to Kamsack, living in his parent’s basement, not working yet, with nowhere to go. He always loved the west coast of Canada and the US and applied for work in Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle, and Portland. 00:31:30 He then saw a posting and applied for a job “in a place called Westchester County”. He had been in NYC once, before he went to the Philippines. 00:32:33 Neal’s first trip to NY was a graduation present to himself. He assumed he would never get back to NY because he would live on the west coast. He stayed in Chelsea at the YMCA. His impression of the City was that it was exciting, but old, dense, dirty a not what he was used to. He was convinced he would never live in NYC. “But never say never”. 00:34:27 He took the job in Westchester County. He moved out on a four-day drive. (1998) 00:35:36 Neal found a roommate on the internet (before google!). He searched the internet for the place in NYC where Canadians live. The Upper East Side came up! 00:36:50 When he was offered the job, he thought he had hit the jack pot salary wise. He drove over the GW Bridge to the Upper East Side, and met his roommate. The apartment was on east 83rd street. It was a rail road apartment and a walk-up. He realized he would not have a place to park his car. When he learned that parking would cost more than $600 a month, (had no idea it was so far to Westchester) and his rent was $1500, and he still had to pay for gas and utilities, he realized he had no money for food. He would have to make some changes. (1998) 00:40:00 Neal described how arriving in the city in 1998 was the beginning of the sanitizing of the City, the decay was past its bottoming out. The new-found safety, cleanliness, and gentrification was very fresh to people who had lived here. They felt like it could go back to the old way any minute. He did not experience what NYC was like before. 00:41:53 Neal then got very involved in his planning work – taking on committee work and doing city projects. He got rid of his car and started working at a new firm for more money. 00:42:35 Neal moved to Williamsburg in 2000. He moved into a very small studio in east Williamsburg. The rent was $400 month. It was a 2nd-floor, wood-frame, walk- up. The rent allowed him to save money, a good stepping stone for Jackson Heights. 00:43:38 While living in Brooklyn and working in the new firm in Manhattan, he asked to get involved in projects to better learn about regions and neighborhoods in NYC. When doing work on these projects, he learned about the economic impact of development on neighborhoods, city infrastructure and transportation systems. 00:47:10 Neal talked about how being a planner is being an overqualified generalist. There is always someone else who is an expert in a particular subject. A planner’s role is to facilitate between the public interest, the developers, and politics. It’s about competition, money, people, power. This is what makes the City go around. Now anytime he reads the paper about Queens communities, he feels intrinsically involved because that is what he does. 00:48:51 Neal came out late to his family and friends, only after moving to NYC. It was less difficult to do after already living here. 1999 was a pivotal point in his life. In coming out, he opened the doors to dating and meeting people. He was married, is now divorced, but a lot of why he came to Queens and lives there is because of his marriage. He and his husband are still part of each other’s lives. 00:50:54 Neal described the decision to move to Jackson Heights. After living together in Brooklyn and saving money, Neal and his spouse wanted to buy a home. They looked around Brooklyn. This was in 2006 – almost at the top of the housing boom, before the big crash. A lot of gay couples (male) and families were moving out to Jackson Heights between 2004 and 2007. It was always a gay neighborhood and very multi-cultural. They had a lot of friends already living in Jackson Heights and they were encouraging them to look at the co-ops and brownstones. The neighborhood was stable and multi-ethnic, accessible to Neal’s work on Long Island and his spouse’s job in Manhattan. They went to a couple of open houses and their attention shifted from Brooklyn to Jackson Heights. The neighborhood was family friendly, had potential for community development, good transportation, and great restaurants. 00:54:51 They eventually bought a co-op at the Windsor. It needed TLC and became Neal’s long-term project to fix it up. He also started looking around for projects to get involved in here to contribute to the neighborhood. 00:56:22 A city planning colleague was co-chairing the Queens Pride Committee and asked Neal to help, knowing he could not say no to help the LGBT community – he is “paying it forward” doing things for our community. 00:57:34 Neal talked about his respect for those older than himself, who had less freedom and privilege about being gay – although he also fought hard. He hopes the next generation appreciates what they have – an easier time being who they are. But he said that you cannot be complacent. We all have a responsibility to be vigilant and not silent when things are under attack or being taken away from us. You can see that happening now in this country and all over the world. 00:59:24 Neal was asked to chair the Queens Pride Parade in 2012. It was a good way to have a voice and contribute to Jackson Heights and the LGBT community. It was a way to be political without being political in terms of party politics. He didn’t know many people in this group as he had recently moved here. He did a lot of community outreach to local bars that put together fabulous floats. 1:02:01 Neal talked about how the Queens parade differs from the Manhattan parade. The Queens parade is a little bit less racy than Manhattan and more family friendly - celebrating safety and diversity. There are community-based groups and it is shorter than Manhattan. 1:04:15 2013 was the 20th anniversary of Queens Pride and with the help of his spouse, who was connected to the theater, their celebrity grand marshal was the cast and crew from Wicked who were either raised or living in Queens. 1:05:59 The focus that year was to fight bullying - not just gay kids but all kids. 1:07:10 They decided to do this by promoting the gay straight alliances in the local public and charter schools. They approached a number Queens high school alliances and invited them to give ideas about how best they could contribute to the parade and festival. The Pride Committee received great feedback from the schools. The students were responsible for the float the morning of the parade and the Wicked crew promoted the anti-bullying and the gay/straight alliances. 1:11:55 Neal talked about Council Member Drumm. It was heartwarming how Drumm has continued to support and advance Queens Pride and the students that had participated in the Parade. They had made arrangements with the Wicked crew for the students to come to Manhattan to the theatre and participate in a meet and greet and back stage walk. Council Member Drumm participated in that. He met the parents, students, and cast members. This was Neal’s crowning achievement of his investment in the Pride Committee. 1:13:54 Story of float getting stuck in a tree! 1:15:31 Neal talked about how when you have finished with a job like that, younger people with energy move in to take your place. You do not do the work to receive thanks but because you want to do something for your community. You want to build something that has inherent goodness and leave it better than you found it. Pride’s 25th anniversary will be a memorable year. 1:16:52 Neal then talked about the Queens Pride Lions Club, chartered in 2011. Joining the club was a way to get more involved in the Jackson Heights gay community. He did not get active until 2015. He did not have the time to commit before then. 1:18:24 He started getting active about two years ago (2015) in the Lions Club. He started attending all meetings and took on more responsibility. It is the first LGBTQ Lions organizations in the US and Canada. He talked about the importance of being out and visible within such a prominent organization, being a community presence, providing club services for the straight and gay community. “We are one of you, just as important as fellow Lions Club that are not so gay.” 1:20:28 The Club was formed as gay club, but is open to friends of gays as well. Activities include– eye care and eye health for people of all ages, youth programs, recycling electronics, paper shredding, and a clothing drive for disadvantaged and homeless youth, primarily LGBTQ. There are so many other projects throughout Queens and NYC. The Club raises its visibility, saying LGBT people are here and part of your world too. He will be Vice President of the Club this year. 1:23:34 In his final statement, Neal talked about his hope for the future. He talked about the community continuing to enrich itself with all sorts of different ethnic activities. He also talked about the importance of Jackson Heights continuing to stand against the discriminatory actions happening across the country. He very eloquently talked about Jackson Heights being a “shining light” in this regard. He also talked about looking forward to remaining in the neighborhood. ",
  "Sullivan_Casey_timecode.txt": "My name is Casey Sullivan and I�m the chef of Queens Comfort in Astoria. It opened in February of this year, 2011, started by Donny and Avery [Donnie D�Alessio and Avery Thompson]. They both were in the film business - they made a lot of horror films and some Pakistani soap operas. They were also interested in restaurants. I�m into movies too, so yes, that explains why these references in the place. When we don�t talk about food we talk about movies. They wanted to do comfort food and were looking for a chef, and I�d just moved to New York from Chicago. I�m from California, from LA, but have pretty much lived all over America - Georgia, Kansas City, Chicago, and a lot of places in the South�Tennessee� I am pretty into America! I am a really big proponent of American culture and I think that especially in the food world - now people are kind of taking notice of it - but historically it hasn�t had the respect that it deserves. You know, people look to France for how to make good food but I think we have good traditions here. And that�s what we try to do. It�s strictly American food, not just Southern. Growing up in LA there were a lot of Hispanic influences also, but definitely, Southern too. Just about comfort, American food. My favorites are smoked meats, like brisket and pulled pork, but my absolute favorite food to eat and cook is fried chicken without a doubt. I think it�s one of the hardest things to cook and eat. And it�s one of the things with the most variances and all the different schools of thought. And everyone thinks theirs is the best. I know we have the best in Astoria here. And I think we have the best in New York. We do our fried chicken pieces � like legs and thighs maybe with some biscuits and watermelon and corn on the side. We usually have it on the weekday nights. This place is very different for where it�s at. There are places like it in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side in Manhattan that do this kind of thing well. But here it�s new. A lot of the things we�re doing takes people time to figure out. Fried green tomatoes�even the way we do burgers, it�s just kind of different for a lot of people. But the reason it�s a success is because people who like it love it. And when more people give it a chance it will be very successful. And we have fun. I think some of the food we�re putting out is the best. We�re actually making some of the best food which is crazy to say. But we�re hard on ourselves, we don�t pull punches as far as this could be better, that could be better. There are a lot of arguments. Its simple food but we take it really seriously. Both of the other guys are bona fide cooks now. They didn�t have restaurant experience at all - front of house or back of house. They started out in the front and it was so hard to find help in the back, and people willing to put in the hours, and also on days like this you can�t afford to pay a bunch of cooks - it�s slow right now. So they have had to step up in the back and they do. When it�s a busy brunch and this place is full it�s me and those two guys, and that�s it. We try to use the green markets - like the one in Union Square. There�s nothing more fun than going to the market and grabbing the green tomatoes and a big bag of corn, and other vegetables. Meat is harder because of the expense. When you start doing free range and local meat you�re looking at adding ten bucks onto a dish. We do what we can though and use local butchers � literally walk down the street, make a call and tell them what we want and go and pick it up. They are both from Long Island. Donny lives in Astoria, Avery lives near. I live in Washington Heights - 176 and Fort Washington. Food is interesting to me and when you�re dealing with food you�re also dealing with American history. It�s a way to be. It�s creative kind of, but it�s also a craft. Like laying bricks, but laying bricks really well. You know. The middle class in this country, the workers, used to be artisans and craftsmen. They didn�t necessarily design great buildings but they built great buildings. You know, like someone designed the Chrysler building but there were guys who built that and that�s amazing. That�s what I think that we do. I don�t invent anything but I feel I make a Chrysler building every day! You know, you pay attention to something, you do everything right, you do it the way you were told to do it, you might find faster ways to do it but you don�t cut any corners. That�s a craft, you know. It�s one of the few crafts left in the country that you can make money doing. I think that in America there is a sense of when you boast about certain foods, if you treat food like it�s important, the American culture doesn�t like that. If someone brags about food people see that as suspect. Like, �well there�s nothing special about this food, it�s the food that my grandmother made,� missing the fact that that�s why it�s important. It�s the food your grandmother made and she took care of it. People have pride in it but then if you were going to go with a career in cooking. Well, the word Chef is a French word. The �career� of cooking meant that you were going to go a European route. But nowadays people don�t want that. I don�t want to eat crepes! I just don�t want to do it! I appreciate the way that they design kitchens and that the philosophy is [food]. I would be running a losing race if I tried to cook French food better than a French guy, you know. And the same holds through. Bring any French guy in to cook our food � put that in! I�ll have a fried chicken challenge with M Wells any day. They do proper Montreal food, and that�s what you should do. If I moved to Berlin I wouldn�t cook Berlin food I�d make fried chicken. I have to do what I do. Most of my training was in Kansas City, where I worked with really good chefs who really know how to cook. I know how to cook in a proper kitchen, run a fish station, meat station, and do all of that. In Kansas City there�s great barbeque and straight American food � it�s found its way into fine dining there. You can have grits, pulled pork etc. on a menu in a fine dining restaurant. Those are the things in my formative years. Now that the other two are well trained we kind of stagger the hours, like I�ll come in a bit later and as the night goes on Donny can leave early; but at the weekend it�s pretty much all three of us all the time. I�ll take a nap right there on the bench. You come in at five and I�ll be asleep right there! These tables Avery built them all. They built this, they built the floors, re-did the wood, the stools, Avery�s mom did all these cushions. They painted the walls. They didn�t mess with the kitchen though - I kind of wish they had. My girlfriend is a mixologist (classic cocktail bar tender) she�s the head bar tender at Caf� Boulud in the City. She got that job in Chicago - so we moved to New York figuring I�d find something. Literally I was here two weeks and I met them, through Craigslist. ",
  "Sullivan_Patrick_timecode.txt": "“I put the collar on her.” “But he let me run lose.” I recently visited Christina and Patrick Sullivan at their house on 39th Avenue in Sunnyside Gardens, where they have lived for more then 40 years. Both came to New York by boat from Ireland. Patrick used to work at the airport helping to track down lost luggage, and Christina worked as a housekeeper. The couple, both long retired, first met at Gaelic Park in the Bronx. “I put the collar on her,” Patrick said in his thick Irish accent. “But he let me run lose,” Christina quickly added among giggles that turned into full-blown laughter.” The wheels of life are turning,” said Patrick, who is 84 years old. When the couple bought their one-family house in 1968 they paid $26,000. The sellers, who had lived in house since it was built around 1930, had paid around $6,000. Real estate prices in the neighborhood went down during the Great Depression and one of their neighbors acquired his house for $5,000 in the 1930s. In 2000 the same house sold for $270,000. now a one-family house in Sunnyside Gardens sells for $500,000 and up. “What happened?” Christina said. “Real estate is a very good business to be in,” Patrick said, matter-of-factly.“We had a very rude one,” Christina said about their own real estate agent 42 years ago. “Oh, he was rotten.” After Christina and Patrick had put down a deposit for the house, the agent received a better offer and tried to give them back their deposit. But the couple refused to take it back and thus managed to acquire the house. Christina and Patrick did not want their photo taken, so we settled on their marriage portrait. (“The good-looking fellow, that’s me,” Patrick said, laughing.) In the podcast Christina and Patrick talk about old times—the creative potential in their neighborhood and mom and pop stores that have long vanished. ",

  "Tabaco-OBrien_Gail_timecode.txt": "Gail Tabaco O’Brien is a long-term resident in Bellerose, Queens. In this interview, Gail spoke about her memories of growing up in Queens with her family and friends. Filipino culture and traditions played a major role in the family. Gail discusses about how her family’s life in Briarwood and how the Filipino culture is reflected to her social life and family life. 00:01:00 Gail was born in Newark, Queens in 1965. She was born in Long Island Jewish Hospital and her mother worked there around 40 years. Her mother had children there as well. She was home for all of her children except for Gail. 00:01:18 Gail was the youngest out of her siblings. Her mother started working there as a nurses aid when Gail was 1 year old and when she was 16 years old. She was 44 years old when Gail’s mother had Gail. 00:01:58 There were 10 of the siblings that are alive and 6 of them passed away for different reasons. Gail is their 16th and youngest child. 00:02:47 Gail’s earliest memory in Queens is when her family had a big yard, where her father used to do gardening, had a harvest and her mother and father used to make flowers. They had a fun time in Glendale Street and they used to play tag with other kids in the neighborhood. 00:04:55 Gail’s older siblings used to go to a Catholic Church, but most of her siblings went to the same public school together. They used go to Elementary school, PS.115, PS. 122, and Martin Vienna High School. 00:05:35 Gail and her siblings used to commute together, bus for elementary school. During middle school, they all had to walked; no bus. During High School, they needed to take the Public Transportation bus. Everyone in the neighborhood had that experience commuting to school. 00:07:28 there were Filipino traditions that they followed back then. Obeying the oldest, men were superior, and there were 6 girls in the family and 4 men in the family, the women had to serve men during dinner, but overall, with all of those traditions, they were all still family. 00:09:00 her parents were very strict compared to her American friend’s parents. Gail and her siblings weren’t allowed to sleepover, they shouldn’t be late when they arrive back home from school. As they got older, Gail’s parents wouldn’t allow them to go outside until they finished all of their chores and work. Before Gail thought that her parents were really strict, however, she realized that her parents were teaching her and her siblings that it is important to grow up. 00:10:00 Gail also learned that doing easy things during your childhood, won’t help you mature as they grow up in the future. 00:11:38 Gail’s family used to go back to Philippines every two years in the early 1970s. Gail only remembers her memory when she was only 8 or 9 years old. But she remembers she had funny memories with her family. There were no electricity back then, but her family had no problem with it. Philippines also had nice scenery and ocean. 00:14:51 Gail went back to the Philippines in 1980 which she vaguely remembers, with her mother, father, and one of her sisters, Mary. Gail didn’t know anyone that much in her father’s side of the family, but she knew her mother side of the family. 00:16:20 Philippines has changed compared to the last time, Gail came when she was 8 or 9 years old. Gail is also glad that her parents took her to the Philippines because it gives her a motivation of being born as a Philippines. To Gail, it felt like she was born there even though she wasn’t really born in the Philippines; they don’t know the language and culture that well. 00:18:40 Gail remembers vaguely about the airports back then when her parents tried to make sure they were together all the time when they were going back to America from the Philippines. At the airports back then, there was militia, but the family had no worries and had a fun time together. 00:20:27 Gail’s brother, Joey, went to the air force and brought her back at TV back from Japan. But overall, even though she was so young back then, Gail had no scary memories. 00:21:52 Gail’s brother, Joey, never really talked about the experience being in the air force. However, Gail’s father was a POW in WWII and he used told her stories about what he experienced back then in the war. Her mother used to tell her stories on WWII about how she and her husband fled to hill with some of their belongings. 00:24:33 In 1980s, Gail used to hang out at the park because back in the days, kids used to go to park a lot. Her sister, Mary, used to play handball back then and since she was educated, she was allowed to go outside and play.

Growing up as a kid, that didn’t matter to him because he had friends from the block and school, however, he felt like an outcast because he and his family felt different from everybody. His father used to tell him that if he heard rumors or insults like that, he should brush it off. 00:02:30 Alex’s strongest memory in Queens is growing up with a big family. His family consist of his father and mother with 10 siblings; which there is 4 boys including Alex and 6 girls. Alex’s deepest memories are spending times with his brothers and sisters. 00:03:50 Alex was the 4th oldest out of all the siblings. He remembers playing board games, and back then when he was a child, school was his main priority. His mother couldn’t finish her education because of the war. 00:05:13 as a kid, playing in the street in their block was normal. They played games like stickball in the street. 00:05:41 A normal day for Alex was going to school, coming back from school, eat dinner, and finish your homework/study, and go to sleep. However, during summer vacation, Alex and his siblings were allowed to stay out longer since there was no school. Around that time, his father spent more time with the kids by like teaching them certain hobbies like gardening, singing and playing the instruments. 00:06:45 Alex, later then, realized that the reason why his father was giving them hard labor to do is because his father wanted to teach them that how to take care of things and how to grow up. 00:06:53 Alex’s father played the ukulele and Alex and his siblings used to make fun of him. He taught his kids how to play the ukulele and taught some of his songs to them.

His older brother, Ron, got the guitar and Alex got a bugle.

He remembers a time when his parents came to watch a game, he used to get hit a lot and his parents didn’t want him to play hockey because his parents thought that he was going to die. 00:18:25 Alex’s family just came off of the Vietnam War in 1969. One of his brothers, Joel, was stationed in Vietnam. The Vietnam War was a hard time for not only the family, but for America because no one can explain what happen in the Vietnam War except for those who survived. They said women and children die due to the aftermath of the War. 00:19:18 His brother didn’t want to explain his experience in the Vietnam War until many years later when he wanted to open up and share his experience about it. 00:21:00 His family was very fortunate going to the Philippines back then. His father was recruited by UN in 1947 and one of the benefits, his father got was that he could bring back his family every two years. 00:21:19 the first time Alex went back to Philippines is 1956 when he was one years old and he continued to go back until 1972 when he started to work over the summer times. 00:21:43 Alex’s memories of going to Philippines were amazing to him because he had a wonderful time with his family even though there were no electricity.

He built so many things for the family like the living room and showed the kids how to use tools. Alex wouldn’t be able to do what he could do if it wasn’t for his father. Alex appreciates on what his father did for the family and for him. He had no friends during his free time; he only focused on his children. Alex believes that his father wanted to go back to Bohol because it was hard for him to communicate with other people in America. His parents went through so much for the family and he appreciates them so much for making the person he is today. 00:51:30 the most important trait in a family is the times and memories when the parents are with their children. 00:54:15 To Alex, going to Queens College at that time played a major role at that time because he spent most of his time outside of campus. Alex attended to Queens College in 1975-1979. Alex had a wonderful time playing in the parks in Queens especially Alley Pond Park and Kissena Park at that time. ",

He even discussed about the times when his family went to Philippines a couple of times before to visit their family over there. Carlos wanted to discuss about the difficult time that they faced in Bellerose, Queens about being Filipino and how other people distinguish them to other races. 00:01:05 Carlos Tabaco was born in Queens Long Island George Hospital in June 19, 1957 and he is the 5th born child in his family out of 10 children. 00:01:40 Carlo’s first memory of Queens is when he got the chicken pox and he remembers that there was a gas station called St. Clair and his father bought Carlos a dinosaur there. After growing up with his siblings, he felt like he was part of one big party. His parent was born in the Philippines. In his family, the girls had a stricter time than the boys because of their traditions as a Filipino. 00:03:17 Carlo’s family couldn’t bring their Philippine’s tradition and culture with them when they left for New York because they didn’t want to stand out in front of the American kids back then. They had to distinguish of being a Filipino family in the household and being an American family in the outside. 00:04:06 In Carlo’s household, there was a line of respect; when the oldest one says to the 2nd oldest to do something, the 2nd oldest would tell the 3rd oldest to do it and it will go on like a pattern. Outside of the house, however, they treated each other as equal because they don’t want to be an outsider and try to be embarrassed by listening to the oldest and doing what he/she was telling them to do. 00:05:45 When the family went to the Philippines, Carlos was in 4th grade and went to school called Divine Work College in the Island of Bahal. Carlos had some easy and hard times when he went to Philippines because he didn’t understand the culture and they didn’t interact with each other as much as they did. Carlos and one of his siblings, Angie, interacted with each other with the most when they were in Queens because they were just one year apart from each other. 00:08:31 when the family was in New York, there were a lot of kids in the block and they did a lot of stuff together. Although Carlos loves the Philippines a lot, he still loves New York more because it consists of more memorable times for Carlos. 00:10:06 Carlos just played with his friends most of the time when he went because his brothers had their own social like Alex was into playing sports. Carlos was more like a street person than a sports person. There was a bowling alley called Stolley Bowling Alley and it was a place for him and his place used to meet up.

They tried to protect those places from other gangs in their areas. 00:14:14 Carlos and his friends used to walk everywhere and there used to be this amusement park in Flushing where they used to go to hitch some rides. When they were 11 or 12 years old, they used to take those buses to travel around like in New Jersey and New York. 00:17:02 a typical day in the Tabaco’s household was waking up, using the bathroom as fast as you can so that the other siblings could use it too, eating breakfast, go to work/ school, eat dinner, and went to sleep. When Carlos was 9 year old, he used to work with his brother, Joey, in the World Fair and get paid $5 per day since back then, everything was so cheap. Their job was to clean up the area and the benefits that they got was a free pass to go anywhere in the World Fair. 00:20:30 When Carlos and Joey got paid from their jobs, they used to contribute to the house. 00:22:59 Carlos and Joey wanted to worked because they just felt like wanting to do it and they thought that it was pretty cool back then. To Carlos, working is just a normal thing to do including helping other people with chores as well. 00:24:36 back then, Carlos and his siblings didn’t get along with each other until much later when they got older. When they were kids, it almost felt like survival of the fittest; they didn’t really spent a lot of play time together. When they were 16 or 17 years old, that is when they started to get along with each other and did almost everything together. They camped, skied, and fished together. 00:27:31 Carlos went to Martin Van Burren High School, for pre-school, he went to P.S. 115, for middle school, he went to I.S 172. In Junior High School, Carlos admits that he did a lot of drugs. He graduated Junior High School in 1975. Carlos and his friends, during 1972 to 1975, wanted to experience what being adulthood would be like. Carlos started smoking during 9 years old, and he started buying cigarettes when he was 11 or 12 years old, but during 9th grade, his best friend tried to convince him to stop doing drugs, and Carlos managed to stop doing them in 10th grade. He barely made it out of high school, since he wasn’t a really good student back then. 00:30:30 back then, when Carlos and his friends used to drive, he and his friends usually meet up in Cunningham Park, Alley Pond Park, and in an empty street where they usually race in. Carlos’ first car was a Toyota Cyclic Jeep T and they managed to put a lot of people in the car. 00:32:10 Carlos used to work at a place called Masters, which now became Models. He used to use the money he earned for gas. After high school, Carlos took 2 years off; he went to Mississippi with his brother, Joey.

Carlos back then was a little wilder than his other siblings. Carlos didn’t learn how to do laundry until he was 44 years old and he doesn’t know how to cook since his sisters had always made the food for him. Carlos, however, did other chores for the family instead like mow the lawn with his father, do gardening with his father. 00:45:00 Carlos’ friends from the past: Kevin, his Irish/Italian friend, Howey, his Jewish friend, and Mitchmizoki, his Polish friend. They used to do everything together like go to bar, flirt with other girls, and etc.… 00:48:35 Carlos’ grandmother was always there for him, and protect him because in the Philippines, it was difficult for Carlos to understand the culture and bond with other Filipinos there. 00:52:10 Carlos’ favorite memory was his marriage with his wife. He met his wife while working for Parliament; she was the department manager. They used to eat lunch together, started to hang out with each other, started to date in 1985. They got married in 1988, and had a daughter in 1990. He had to work for a lot of hours and his time management destroyed his marriage, but later on, he overcame that depression by just going on with his life with his friends and family. ",

  "Tabaco_MolinaFrances-MooreAngelina_timecode.txt": "Frances Tabaco Molina and Angelina Tabaco Moore is long-term resident living in Bellerose, Queens. In this interview, Frances and Angelina spoke about her family life, their childhood living in Bellerose, Queens and their experience in the Philippines.

Their father was the first Filipino in the Philippines to hire in the United Nations. One day, their mother followed their father back then by herself and she had a hard time adjusting in America because she didn’t know English and didn’t know where to go. Her mother told her that the only time she was scared was when she thought that she was never going to meet their father at the airport in 1947, but eventually she did meet him. 00:03:47 Angelina and Frances’ father was a teacher in Malena before he got the job for the UN. He was also a Carpenter in Bohol. One of his other jobs consist him helping out an American family before, that also when he found out about the job for the UN. 00:04:46 when the family moved in to America, they stayed at a house with their siblings: Joey, Joanne, Robbie, and Alex in Newark Park, Queens. Her father, however, stayed at an apartment for employees back then. 00:07:08 back then, when Angelina and Frances were growing up, their father used bring home a few Filipino friends and tried to entertain them by throwing parties. Their parents were really strict; when their father looked at them with intent, they knew immediately that there were people coming over. 00:08:29 while Angelina and Frances were growing up, they weren’t allowed to go out and have fun unless it is with their family. They remember the time when they went to Jones Beach with their father. Their mother used to stay home back then taking care of Gale, one of their sisters, until when she was 1 year old. When Angelina and Frances used to be home alone with their siblings, the girls in the family would have to take care of the boys in the family like making them food, cleaning the house, and do the chores. They did this because it is a Filipino tradition that they had to follow; they lived in the way that a regular Filipino would have lived like. 00:10:45 Back then, there were no Filipino in the area that they lived in. They couldn’t associate with any Filipino back then because their father’s friends, who he brought over, didn’t have any kids. When they used to go to the Philippines back then during the summer time, they used to live with the grandmother’s house. Normally, they leave the Philippines the week before school starts. 00:12:08 Angelina and Frances remembers going to the Philippines for their first time when they were 5-6 years old. They remember feeding the chickens and they remember that their parents were really strict at home. When they were in the Philippines, since there were so many of them and their siblings, certain people were also watching them and making sure that they were okay. 00:13:08 they were remember riding a boat from New York to San Francisco and they took pictures at the Golden Gate Bridge. They also remember taking the plane to the Philippines. 00:15:08 The games that they used to play back then was similar to baseball, however, the game was originated from the Philippines and they brought to New York and they used to play it at Newark Park. They used to play this board game that originate from the Philippines called Sonja; they used to play that game a lot more than chess and checkers. 00:16:49 back then, they used to play games, but not as much. Angelina and Frances used to sing a lot back then. Their brothers played the guitar back then. Their family used to also sing a lot of popular songs together like ‘planting rice’, Filipino song. Their father used to play the Ukulele. 00:17:56 their father loved music, but their mother wasn’t really much of a fan of it. Their mother used to be always in the kitchen when they were home; she was always busy cooking for the family and taking care of the kids. Their mother didn’t even watch TV with them when their father allowed them to watch TV. They used to watch TV shows like Superman and Batman. While the girls were watching something, when their brothers wanted to watch something as well, they usually change the show that they like to watch. 00:20:15 they used to go to a church called Lady of the Snow. Her sister, Esther, bought their parent’s house. Her father had a garden in the back yard, and they used to go help him harvest and plant the flowers sometimes. 00:21:00 basically, all of them basically grew up together because they had no cousins living in America. They hung out together most of the time; they even had friends at their block as well. 00:23:30 they went to school in the Philippine for one year when they were 1st or 2nd grade in 1966. The most difficult thing that they faced while going to school in the Philippines was the language barrier. When they try to speak English, other Filipinos laugh at them, but they still helped them out because they understood the communication problem. 00:28:33 they celebrated their first Christmas at the Philippines. There was no snow; it was very humid there. Their cousin cut their Christmas tree because Angelina and Frances always kept asking where the Christmas tree is. Their mother bought gifts for them and they used to have Christmas Carols singing in front of their house. They are thankful for Christmas now when they live in America because they tell their kids that in other countries, they celebrate it differently compare to American celebrating Christmas. 00:30:18 The Elementary School that they used to go to is P.S. 115. School was pretty difficult and it goes in a very fast pace here compared to a Filipino school. They went back to an American school when they were in 3rd or 4th grade. The system felt different for them because they came back to America from the Philippines; they needed time to readjust to their system. Learning, reading got a lot of faster, and going to other classrooms when they switch subjects confused them. 00:31:53 during 6th grade, Angelina and Frances went back on track to their system and they weren’t falling behind anymore. It took a while for them to get back on their pace, but there were more things that changed while they were gone. Their friends from back then, made other friends, so it was difficult for them to get used to them. 00:33:33 back then, they used to have a lot of bicycles in the back yards. They ride together at the block most of the time, not on the street thought. They also used to create bicycle with different parts and back then, kids used to ride popular bike called Swinge. 00:35:28 their brother, Joey, used to be part of a gang in the late 60s. Gangs were forming around that time which was also part of the reason why their parents sent Angelina and Frances to the Philippines. Joey was also a leader in one of the gangs at that time, so other gangs didn’t really bother any of them. Robbie, their brother, was not part of a gang; however, he used to hang out with his friends outside. Their parents were very concern about the family’s safety so they tried to prevent some of their kids to go outside and then they moved to the Philippines for a while. 00:39:00 during high school, that is when they get start seeing Asians around the neighborhood; back then, there weren’t that much Asian people that lived around their neighborhood. 00:39:19 a lot of the kids would make fun of Angelina and Frances at first, until kids find out that they are part of the Tabaco family, they tend to back off. So they didn’t really have a problem at school when it came to bullying. 00:40:35 Back then, people knew their neighbors whether it was the kids or parents, unlike the present time. 00:44:45 Angelina and Frances usually went to the park with the younger siblings back then at P.S. 115. All of the kids would go there; it would be the main place for kids to have fun and meet up back then. 00:46:35 there was no prejudice in the area that they lived in. They were the only Filipino in their area, but they lived their life in their own way. Their parents bought their house in 1953; the neighborhood was basically filled with white people. The white people start a petition to kick the colored folks out of their neighborhood. But their father wasn’t going to let the white folks kick them out back then. 00:49:15 in their neighborhood, there used to 1 Jewish family, their Filipino family, and the rest of their neighbors were all white people. 00:50:38 Angelina and Frances didn’t get racially discriminated that much because kids back then, only focused on the blacks, and white kids didn’t know where to place their status back then. Angelina and Frances also had white and black friends so they were in the mix of both popularity races in Junior High School. 00:51:30 Angelina, Frances and their siblings went to the same high school, which was Martin Van Burren High School in Queens Village. They used to ride bus together, or walk to school and home together because their parents want them to safe. 00:57:03 there was one Filipino in their high school other than them. They were in the same music class as her. They got to know her more and she played the Viola. She was very quiet, born in the Philippines as well and she came to America at a very young age. Her parents were very strict like Angelina and Frances’ parents. She was very quiet most of the time, but she would talk to Angelina and Frances because she was Filipino as well. 00:59:15 the teachers in their school knew their family because of their older siblings and the well-known family that had about 10 kids with very strict parents. The teachers knew Angelina and Frances older siblings as well because they knew that they were very good the subject, so when they needed help with their homework, they told them to ask one of their sisters or brothers for help. 01:00:48 they met Filipino from other boroughs like the Bronx; their father knew people from the Bronx and they were Filipino. They tried to hang out with them; however, if they didn’t know the language that they speak, they would be offensive toward them. 01:04:27 the guys started to drive during their high school times except for the girls. The girls started driving when they were 18 or 19 years old. Most of the time, it is the girls that drives the car because the guys normally take the bus or train. 01:08:45 While growing up with a Filipino family, they were family oriented. Their parents focused on the kids’ education and their safety. Their mother didn’t want them to rely on anyone else; she wanted them to stand on your own two feet. By the time, when they were going to college, their father didn’t want them to go to college because he believes that the woman in the family should be at home cleaning and cooking for the family. But some of them still went to college and one went to trading school. 01:10:55 Angelina and Frances doesn’t regret with how they were raised by strict Filipino parents. Their parents did the very best that they could and they imprinted on what a family should be. Their parents did a wonderful job at raising their children and Angelina and Frances believe that they wouldn’t be who they are right now, wouldn’t their parent’s teaching and blessing. 01:16:20 New York has influenced their life by making it a home for them. Angelina and Frances is not just being proud as being a Filipino American, but also being a true New Yorker, who grew up in New York. They believe that New York is the place where you have the opportunity to become anything that you want to be. They want to bring their relatives and friends from Philippines and share their great experience that they had in New York. ",

  "Tate_Gerard_timecode.txt": "In this interview, Gerard Tate discusses his life, historical events and how the community of Ridgewood has changed from the early 20th century to the present day. His formative years coincided with the Great Depression and the Second World War: a period of relative poverty and little mobility. As he notes, few people frequented areas beyond their immediate neighborhood. He attended P.S 88, graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in 1953, attended Cornell University and subsequently served on active duty in the army for two years to 1962, before the escalation of the Vietnam War. Back in Ridgewood, Gerard became a junior high school teacher. He has also traveled extensively throughout the world. He notes that today, the community of Ridgewood has become much more diverse; once home to a mostly German population, the neighborhood now has people of Hispanic, Indian, Muslim and Chinese heritage. 00:00:38: Earliest memories of Queens are of the Vander Ende-Onderdonk home. Gave a book on this home to Leslie. 00:02:32: Picture of Eidershtein�s: sister got married in Rackless meadow and had her reception in Eidersthein (a German restaurant). Room was not air conditioned: fans run by a central machine. Real time German establishment; best German food; served the best German food; Zum Stammtisch also very good. 00:03:37: In early 1900s, Eidersthein was on an old farm road. 00:04:00: Father was born in 1894. His uncle owned a funeral parlour in downtown Brooklyn. Funerals were held there; people in horse drawn carriages would come out on Metropolitan Ave. People would conduct funeral services in cemetery there and after funeral service in Brooklyn, have funeral lunch in Eidersthein. 00:05:00: Big debate in German congregation: which restaurant had the best sauerbrauten? Always settled on Eidersthein�s instead of Zum Stammtisch. 00:05:31: Father was born in Brooklyn, mother born in Manhattan. Consolidation (of the two areas) occurred in 1898. Can look it up Ridgewood Times. 00:06:20 Paul Curries tried to save Eiderstheins; original owners wanted to sell it but couldn�t sell very well because it wasn�t historical anymore. After the historic part of the building was taken down, the restaurant was no longer considered historic. Infrastructure was in very bad shape. It is now an Arby�s. 00:07:02 There was a trolley that followed the same route as the B58 (now called Q58): 00:07:43 Trolley/bus start at the Brooklyn side of Wyckoff Avenue. Labeled D58 (the trolley) or B58 (the bus). 00:07:58 Decided to change bus name to Q58: because it only has stops in Queens (only a block or two in Brooklyn). 00:08:29 During the war, government ripped up rails in many places. But, they did not extract rails in Fishmond road and under the L train. 00:08:43 Gerard and his friends would put pennies under the rails: the trolley would flatten penny out. This is similar to the penny souvenir machine. 00:09:27 P.S. 88 during WW2: used to grow victory gardens during first and second World Wars. Grew tomatoes etc but Gerard doesn�t have a green thumb 00:10:24 Grandparents were second owners; brought house in 1917. 00:10:50 When mother was born in Manhattan in 1898, used to live in various places in Manhattan. Wasn�t nice in Manhattan. So mother�s parents moved from Manhattan to corner of Seneca and Linden (used to be a drug store there); mother lived block or two behind drug store. 00:11:40 In 1916, mother graduated from teacher training. In 1917, all male teachers gave up munificent teacher salary to work in the war industry. NYC was center of manufacturing in USA at that time. Can still see traces of pollution there today; 00:12:00 Friend took him to Gowanus canal for 77th birthday; Newtown Creek Alliance is managing remediating efforts in the polluted canal. Gerard has visited several different canals in Europe and Asia. 00:13:31 During his trip to the Gowanus canal, Gerard saw a drunk tear through a hill right into the water; HazMat team had to rescue him out of the polluted waters. 00:14:21 Father�s family arrived before Civil War; lived in downtown Brooklyn; used to live in the area where they built the telephone building. 00:15:01 Father would go to bars with a metal tin can. Enter the bar through the side entrance (for kids). Collect can of beer (liquor) to take to construction workers. Construction worker lower rope; father put growler on the rope. 00:15:55 Used to call refrigerator an ice box up to the mid 50s. 00:16:05 Depression through WW2: ten year gap where nothing really changed. Neighborhood didn�t change; people had little mobility. No cars whatsoever. Would play ball in the streets. 00:17:26 Mother got job as a schoolteacher in 1917; income of mother and grandparents pooled to buy house on Linden street (Gerard lives there now). 00:17:58 May walks; Grandmother would organize Maywalk from Seneca to where current house is located; would have May pole celebrations. 00:18:33 Communists co-opted May Day: people don�t recognize holiday anymore. No more May walks. 00:19:23 Library of Grover Cleveland (part of Queensborough Public Library I think�) hasn�t changed; lighting design is still the same. Ceiling is exactly the same. 00:20:17 Cathy became chair of education committee. Got money to put new fluorescent lighting and turned old reference room into a computer lab. 00:21:13 All the people he knew have passed away. No longer has intimate friends on his block. 00:21:57 Had close friends living on the same block growing up. Went to same grammar school, church, etc. 00:22:23 Population of Ridgewood was stable up until second World War. People didn�t really have any money to move. 00:23:00 Ridgewood was the center of clothing manufacturing for many years (until jobs were outsourced). People bought fabric and there were a lot of knitting mills. Women worked in mills. 00:23:50 Women would work in knitting mills and then walk home from the factories. There were knitting mills of different sizes all over Ridgewood. 00:24:40 Clothing manufacturers went to different countries: Ridgewood wages couldn�t compete-end of clothing manufacturing in the area. 00:25:32 During War, Military/ Navy employed tens of thousands of people. ConEd employed hundreds of people to perform jobs now done by machines. 00:25:51 Father worked for Brooklyn Edison. USA entered ww1 in 1917: no man his (father�s) age could stay home; all volunteered for the army. 00:26:26 Father volunteered for the army, even though he had an exempt job. Never served overseas: was in machine guns training program in Georgia. Unit was not called; armistice of 1918 ended the war. 00:27:41 Served in army in the 1960s. Landed at an airport in Georgia (unsure of name). Walk in through concourse; saw segregation (negro water fountain, white water fountain etc). 00:28:29 Shocked at segregation. 00:28:50 Took bus to Columbus, Georgia to army training center; only saw white people in bus. 00:30:00 Theatre performance of �The Princess and the Pea�: only saw white people in the theatre; saw African Americans sitting in the far balcony. 00:31:32 Ridgewood used to be very German; German newspaper, movie theater, 00:31:42 Took German in Cornell. 00:37:22 Was at the infantry in Fort Bennings. 00:37:46 Served as kitchen police at Fort Dicks. Dished out mashed potatoes. 00:38:41 Classmate from Cornell had degree in English but since he came from College of Agriculture, was assigned to Kansas City as a meat inspector. Gerard (an Economics major) assigned to infantry magazine. 00:39:43 Served for two years in the Army after he graduated. 00:40:32 Considers himself lucky. He was too young/had a college exemption for Korea. Also, he served two years on active duty and was already in an inactive role (served as a peacetime soldier) when the Vietnam conflict escalated. 00:41:52 Peeled potatoes with peelers but couldn�t get the eyes out: had to cut eyes out. 00:42:35 Clean trays; Make sure everything is clean then go back to barracks. 00:43:50 Had fond memories of life in the army; relatively stress-free because it was not wartime. 00:44:28 Knew sergeants who had served in WW2/Korea and still serving in the 1960s. Could talk to eminent individuals one-on-one. 00:45:40 Was able to serve steak to General/President Eisenhower as part of the Ivy League Platoon (Gerard represented Cornell, couple of people from the other Ivies-Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown). 00:46:52 Follow me statue for the infantry; General wanted a �Follow-me� statue holding an M1 gun. 00:49:26 1968: Vietnam War started in earnest. 00:50:16 USA used to be very friendly with Ho Chi Minh; He and the Americans celebrated victory over Japan in WW2. 00:50:50 U.S. was suckered into Vietnam conflict by the French. 00:51:24 U.S. had built World War 2 style Western European army. The French originally tried to fight the Vietnamese guerilla army with a Western Army. U.S tried to fight using WW2 style Western European army. Overall, Gerard observes that you can�t win a people�s war with this tactic. 00:51:48 We still haven�t figured out how to fight a guerilla war (Iraq, Afghanistan); Vietnam war was a losing proposition from the start. 00:52:17 Vocal opposition to Vietnam War-talk to Tom Dowd about this. 00:52:30 Growing up, neighborhood was all German. His family moved to Ridgewood from Manhattan because they wanted to have a yard. Ridgewood was the first suburb community served by trolley (for transportation to Manhattan) 00:53:15 War (first and second world wars) spurred economy. 00:53:26 1960s community was all-German. German newspaper, radio, German clubs 00:54:25 Children of German immigrants moved out to suburbs and other areas of country. Neighborhood gradually became Italian and Hispanic. Records in Catholic church reflect changing demographic. 00:55:00 Now, Eastern Europeans and African Americans are moving in. 00:55:16 Queens is most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the world. Stunned when he heard Afro-Americans in Queens speaking an African language he heard in Africa. 00:56:36 Came back from Ghana. During a walk in Flushing Meadow Park, he sees two Ghanaian women sitting on a log selling things just as they do at a marketplace in Accra. Notes irony: He could have just taken a Q58 bus (probably to Flushing) instead of getting vaccines/traveling 10,000 miles to experience Ghanaian culture. 00:57:14 Went to Ghana to become a schoolteacher. Sister and brother in law were professors. 00:57:48 Went to Ghana with Museum of African Art. Director of the trip knew everybody 00:58:18 Stayed in famous five star European style hotel called the Hote d I�voire. 00:58:56 European style supermarket in back near hotel. 00:59:30 Went to East Africa with teacher�s crew. Noted that when he went for the first time, the society was completely segregated. People weren�t really allowed to approach his hotel. 01:00:55 No eggs/chickens in many West African cities unless you imported them from Europe. Heifer Project built fish ponds/ established indigenous chicken agriculture. 01:01:58 During a trip to West Africa in the 1990s, Gerard was able to observe the beneficial effects of the Heifer Project. With an abundance of fish ponds (artificial ponds), people were able to consume protein in the form of fish every night. Women walked around selling eggs. 01:02:40 Went to Africa with a lot of professors. These included a man based at the museum of African Art, sister professor, etc. 01:03:11 Was reluctant to bargain with the market sellers. 01:03:32 Went to a place and saw women making blankets. Blanket cost $15. Gerard asked to pay $14.95. Settled on $14.99. Gave $2.00 as a thank you. 01:05:44 Communists took over Ethiopia; killed everybody. 01:05:58 Ethnic divisions in Africa got out of hand; every hotel they (Gerard and his company) stayed at were trashed and featured in the newspapers. 01:06:33 Hote d�Ivoire and supermarket in Cote d�Ivoire was trashed. Manager asked; �Why are you trashing it? It�s not European.� 01:07:12 Graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in 1953. Grover Cleveland featured on the class ring. 01:07:48 Made hats on Class Day, probably made of cardboard. 01:08:51 Has a 1953 class hat. 01:09:06 Also has a1957 hat from Cornell University (when he was a freshman at Cornell). 01:13:01 55th anniversary of the high school in June 13, 1986; Celebration; people sang old songs about the school. 01:14:01 Became a schoolteacher in Ridgewood after coming back from the army. Bought house for mom and has been living in Ridgewood ever since. 01:14:32 Taught at junior high school; doesn�t remember name of the school. 01:14:52 Got involved in politics for John Lindsay (was night mayor for John Lindsay). 01:15:12 When he was night mayor at Paulback City Hall, the nighttime security consisted of himself, Sid Davidoff, Jeff (became head of Disneyland) one police officer, janitor on duty. 01:15:50 Father was involved in politics with grandfather (his father�s father) back before first World War. 01:16:10 Remained Republican until John Lindsay was thrown out of Republican party-became a Democrat afterwards. 01:17:34 Mom would get a phone call-phone call would come to pharmacy. Messenger kid would come to his mom and tell her she had a job for a day (sounds like mom started as a per diem teacher). 01:18:30 Mom and dad married; lived on second floor of grandparents� house sister was born in 1930. When grandparents passed away, family took over whole house. 01:19:20 Parents took trip around the world when they retired; traveled extensively. 01:20:02 Was a boy scout for 8 years. 1953: Boy Scout had a jamboree out in California. Traveled on the BNO Railway (featured in Monopoly game) 01:21:35 Stopped at several places Washington D.C., maybe Kansas City; train station rest stops aren�t there anymore. 01:22:19 California was building up university campuses. (Maybe Boy scouts organization) bought a cattle ranch and set up a world-wide jamoboree there. 01:22:58 Stopped at Chicago on the way back. 01:23:24 Carlos Ramulo; president of the Philippines. 01:23:44 Left when Japanese (took over). Took famous picture with General MacArthur. 01:24:27 Carlos came to USA after the war and was honored by the Boy Scouts. 01:24:59 Gerard was there when Carolos was presented a Scout Honor for being involvement in liberation of Philippines. 01:26:12 Some people criticize McArthur for leaving Corregidor (base in Philippines). 01:27:00 Declared to Filipinos that he shall return. Was a very inspiring figure 01:28:05 Pearl Harbor and Japanese air raids showed that in war, you could no longer have a battle fleet unprotected by aircraft carriers. 01:28:46 British/American battle fleet tried to stop Japanese takeover of Singapore/Malaya but had no aircraft carrier. Japan destroyed the fleet. Consequently, the U.S could not save the Philippines from invasion. 01:29:48 President ordered McArthur to break out. 01:31:35 McArthur flew/retreated to Australia 01:32:38 Remembers December 7th, 1941 very clearly; went out to World�s Fair Ground (ice skating rink); remembers the announcement that all military personnel must report to the nearest military base. 01:33:28 German U-boats torpedoed oil tankers near Rockaway beach; people visiting the beach got their feet dirty from oil clumps. 01:34:26 Enforced blackout sessions in East Coast; as a precaution against German air raids. Black out shades for home windows during air raid drills. 01:35:10 Air raid warrens come around telling people to keep lights off. 01:37:00 New York City and whole country was static because of depression and war. Considers himself lucky because his parents kept their jobs during The Great Depression. The family would go out to Huntington for vacation. 01:38:19 Had first pizza when he was a freshman at Cornell; people did not travel extensively outside of their immediate neighborhood so they were unable to sample different food. 01:39:09 People living in suburbia were more isolated; many didn�t have telephones and could not really travel to the city. 01:40:23 Very rarely met people from outside your neighborhood. E.g. you would never meet a Jewish person outside of New York City. 01:41:09 Only three religions in New York: Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism; Students would know that during Catholic holidays, Catholic teachers would take off. Jewish teachers take off during Jewish holidays. 01:42:34 Now recognize Moslem/ Indian holidays. 01:43:12 Talks about the Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese Chinese conflict over the organization of the Lunar New Year celebrations. 01:44:01 Anniversary Day in Ridgewood: anniversary of the founding of the Sunday School Union. Churches had Anniversary Day parade consisting of thousands of Sunday school students; parade of many blocks. Schools in Queens and Brooklyn were closed for that day (this eventually became Brooklyn Queens day). 01:44:52 Hundredth anniversary was the last organized parade-extremely low turnout; mostly senior citizens came out. 01:46:35 Rockefeller (mayor?) signed a bill that mandated Brooklyn Queens day as a holiday. 01:47:32 A lot of churches that used to be around are no longer there. For example, there used to be a church right across the street from a McDonald�s: attendance progressively decreased until the church had to be de-sessioned. 01:49:56 Gerard�s church was started by Germans that moved to Queens from Brooklyn and Manhattan. Used to have services in German and English until the German pastor left. 01:51:16 Gerard mentions a church behind a bank (maybe Ridgewood Savings Bank) that has become Taiwanese. Used to be a sisterhood run by Protestant German �nuns� (women who serve a role similar to that of nuns). 01:54:01 Talks about the P.S. General Slocum disaster: group of German Americans took a boat trip in Manhattan; boat caught on fire. Many people, mostly consisting of young women, children and the elderly died. Many of these dead are buried in a cemetery near the site of Eidersthein�s Restaurant (currently an Arbys). This disaster precipitated a huge decrease in the German congregation of downtown Manhattan. ",
  "Taylor-Johnson_Florence_timecode.txt": "00:00:00 Florence Taylor-Johnson was born in Manhattan on December 30, 1928. Three months later, her family uprooted and moved to Elmhurst, Queens. She remarks how Queens was a lot different back than it is now. One major change she noticed were the ethnic demographics in her neighborhood. 00:10:35 Florence recalls her family being one of the first families of African American descent in the neighborhood. She often felt discriminated against—which cut like a knife. 00: 18:42 Florence believed her children had a good childhood and appreciated it. However, she does not think her grandchildren did. 00:19:43 Florence received her high school diploma from Flushing High School in 1946. Her parents encouraged her to attend college. However, she chose the latter and decided to get married and start a family. 00:20:40 On the weekends, Florence enjoyed going to the movies with her brother and taking weekends trips with her family. 00:27:40 Florence had the opportunity to join the Civil Rights March in Washington. Doing this made her fee like she was a part of something greater then herself. This also made her feel she could make improve social conditions. 00:29:04 Although, Florence was busy with her family, she always made time to march. She recalls marching in the Labor Day Parade with a baby carriage. Although she was not able to march as often when she became a mother, she felt it was the quality of the time she gave is what counted. 00:33:42 She feels people growing up in 1995 were different from the generation she was a part of. She makes a distinction saying that adults the mid-1990s weren’t as outspoken about political and social issues. She believes this is because people are concerned with keeping their jobs and what the people around them thought. Florence believed this was out of fear of being called racist. 00:36:42 In March 1968, Florence was working at a local social security office. A few days after Florence started her employment, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This event upset her very much and what angered her even more was the fact that people had acted like nothing had happened. She was so bothered by this experience that she decided to walk out. Her boss told her that if she left she would be fired and she calmly responded “I guess I’ll be fired”. She described the time period between the death of MLK and funeral as a “traumatic time”. 00:38:25 Florence recalls being ridiculed for being an activist. ",

Sharon: Yea. Johana: And, where did you decide to go to school? Sharon: I did a lot of more traveling around the country by myself before I went to college and then I ended up living, I lived in San Francisco for a while and then I ended up moving to Cincinnati and that’s where I went to college cause they have a very nice, old art school over there. Johana: Oh, that’s cool. And, you got your Bachelor’s in Art? Sharon: Yea, and painting yea. Johana: Painting, oh wow. And, I saw on your biography that, looking at your website, that you went to teach in Mexico and in Canada, how was that? Sharon: I taught in several other states, I didn’t teach in Mexico or Canada, I traveled there. But I taught in school in Ohio and I taught in the Ozark, Southern Missouri. Johana: How was that? Sharon: That was a bit of a culture shock, but interesting, yea. Johana: Did you do a lot of art projects there? Sharon: I did with kids, I did a lot of art projects in the Ozark they were very, you know, they were a little, I don’t want to say they were deprived, but they were hungry to make a lot of things, do a lot of things, and they were really good at it. Johana: That’s good, that’s always good. And, then you said you went to teach in Mexico? Sharon: No, no… Johana: No, just, just. Sharon: I never taught in Mexico. When I was a kid we used to live there on and off. We lived there for half the year when it was cold, my father didn’t like the cold. Johana: Oh, that’s cool. Sharon: So, we go down there for the winters and come back. And, it was also early in Mexico before it got too touristy in the South, so and he always, would never, always had to be south of Mexico City cause he was like, it’s not real ‘till you get south of Mexico City. That was his whole thing. Johana: That sounds fun. Sharon: Yea. Johana: And, then did you go to Canada as well? Sharon: I did a lot of motorcycle trips up through Canada, so stayed and camped up there, did a bunch of traveling up there, so. Johana: That’s nice. Sharon: Yea, it was interesting. Johana: And how, how was that? Sharon: It was rough, like being on a motorcycle all the time, 24/7, and then camping but when you’re young, you can, you know there were a lot of times, you know, when it’s raining or whatever and you don’t stop because as soon as you stop you get even wetter, so you just keep going and that was hard but otherwise it was really fun Johana: That sounds like a good time. And, then was it, back then was it dangerous traveling or no? Sharon: Not like it is, I mean, I feel like it was, it was more common, people, I did a lot of hitchhiking back and forth across the country and it was a bit more common then. I don’t know, I was, I was lucky, you know, I was never in trouble to speak of. But, I feel like now, you know, with, there is a lot of, I don’t know if it’s hyped or if it’s really is really dangerous, I mean it’s probably a combination, but people just don’t do it anymore, but actually from what I can tell. Johana: It’s pretty dangerous now I’ve heard. Sharon: Well and, all the youngsters just want to make money, like nobody is interested in like finding themselves you know. Johana: Exactly. And, how did you end up here in New York? Sharon: When I went art school in Cincinnati we used to come here twice a year just to see art, do a lot of stuff and I had a lot of friends who had gone to art school and then moved here. And so, I had a daughter, when I lived in California, I had a daughter, I was a single mom, and then she went with me to the Ozarks to teach and then I brought her here to New York one time and when she was only five and for the next three years, she was just like when are we moving there, when are we moving there? I was worried she would be overwhelmed and she just loved it and so we moved here when she was eight. And we’ve been here ever since. Johana: Does she like art like you? Sharon: She is an architect. She went to Cornell and Harvard so now she is a, she is a designer now, but she went to school for architecture. Johana: And what have you done here in the city, have you done many projects? Sharon: I taught art in the public schools, I taught in the Bronx for a while, and then I taught in a school in Queens for 18 years, I taught art and then I did a lot of like mural projects. I did the JR’s Turn the World Inside Out. I did, we did a lot of, I had we worked at five points before they tore it down, I had kids that were interns, I got them jobs in a lot of art places. And of course, we went to all the museums and stuff. It’s a great place to teach art and you know teenagers, they always, they usually always like art class. Johana: Yea, it’s fun. And what, can you tell me a little bit more about the JR art project? Sharon: Basically, it was, he had a truck where you would come and take portraits of people and then we would, we paste them on to place and when he came to Times Squares, I took a bunch of kids down there and, you know, they had their portraits taken and we got to meet them and we pasted their faces on Times Squares. Johana: Oh that’s fun, and how was that, what year was that and like? Sharon: 2013 maybe… Johana: 13 Sharon: Maybe, maybe he won price, the like TED talk price in 2011 and so it was just a couple years after that’s when he started doing the inside out project, so it might have been 2013, 12, 13, 14, I know it was before the end of 2014 so. Johana: Oh, that’s nice, and what other projects have you done in the city? Sharon: We did the Queens 7 train mural project which is a different murals along the 7 train line in the city that were supported by the DOT and like the one on the bridge that goes, that’s on the street that turns into Queens Boulevard, there is a mural that goes from Long Island City over to La Guardia Community College. It’s 850 feet and we helped a bunch of us helped paint that and now the guy who designed it and originally started the project has moved to Nevada, so now the last couple years we’ve kind of been, me and the kids were kind of in charge of the upkeep Johana: And, then how is it like painting a mural that big? Sharon: Exhausting. It just never ended, but it was a really nice design and it was designed from the patterns of sneaker bottoms and then there was a shoe string design that went all the way through the mural and it would just peak out of different parts, so it was really beautifully designed. And, the sections were big bold colors so it was easy to do it wasn’t too, you know, tiny details. Johana: What time of year do you do that in? Cause… Sharon: We did that in the Spring and in the Fall mostly like in the Spring now we check it for, it only, it doesn’t get graffitied very often, people are very you know respectful of it but occasionally it would get graffiti or stickers put on it or some of the paint would start to chip off and we’d go in and try to fix it up in the Spring and sometimes in the fall or whenever there is graffiti we try to cover it up right away so it doesn’t catch on, you know. Johana: Do you use some type of special paint so that like the weather doesn’t? Sharon: No, it’s just in Januvik. I want to give them a plug that’s a big Januvik spread there on the Boulevard and they really helped, they donated everything, all the paint and all the materials, the brushes, paints, you know, plastic they donated it all so, so I can always go back to them and be like “we need this color” and they just donate it for the life of the mural so. Johana: Oh, that’s good, have you done any other projects? Sharon: I mean, I know we have, I just, we have, we did, we have a big expo night every year that, where the kids, like did all these different shows and then we would have…our high school was a big part of the consortium’s schools so we would have group shows in different places of all the kids’ artwork, so different things like that. Johana: Do you still teach? Sharon: I just, last year, I just retired, so I still see the kids sometimes. I still have relationships with kids that I had way back in the day, like in, and help them with college projects and stuff, bigger things, but, and I just went to my principle’s retirement party, so I’m still in touch with the school, do a few projects with them, but mostly I’m retired. Now, I get to paint my own stuff. Johana: So, when you were teaching what kind of stuff did to teach to kids? Cause I know like some art classes are different than others? Sharon: Yea, mine was mostly about…I’m definitely a proponent of black mount school like basically I mean art is good for self-expression and you know a lot of that sort of thing, but I think art is about teaching people to make decisions. Teaching people to own things because for the most part in school you’re worried about or taught things to memorize or that you can regurgitate at some point and I think art it does the opposite, it teaches you how to make decisions, it teaches you that nobody else can make a decision for you and that you have to, like, face your own fears or you have to take risks, you know, and you have to be willing to acknowledge your sloppiness and do whatever you have to do. You have to work, you know, you have to work with it, you have to work with what’s inside and sometimes that’s very scary for kids, but its good like it teaches them to trust themselves and learn how to make decisions. Johana: That’s good. Does everyone have like a specific painting style? Sharon: Everybody has a style, like, you know, I try to give them a lot of times, I would give them a lot of medium choice so that if they felt like a certain medium would express what they wanted to say they could choose that. You know, and kids are all different some of them would know right away what they wanted to do, how they wanted to do it and other kids would just agonize over like concept and I would always hear this like “Miss I don’t know why I’m in this class, I don’t know how to draw,” you know that was it, but they just got to work through all of that and then figure out that it’s not about that, it’s not about skill level anymore, it’s about like examining things so Johana: That’s good, and I think I read somewhere that you went back to school for your Master’s? Sharon: Yea I did, I went back to school for my Master’s in a, mostly in liberal studies because I had to, cause in New York, like I had a lot in the two other states where I taught. I have teaching degrees in two other states and they don’t expect you to have a Master’s Degree, they expect you to have teaching certification so they’re a lot more stringent in other states it’s a lot more rigorous on how you learn to teach. Whereas, in New York you just, you basically need a Master’s Degree, you’re not, you’re really not, to have a lot of, you do some professional development every year but you’re not necessarily required to take courses specifically designed to teach you how to teach. Johana: Oh ok, and is there like a specific way they teach you how to teach art or is it just in general? Sharon: No because then you know it’s a fluid thing and a lot of people teach it differently. There’re specific classes you can teach like, you know, drawing or painting or whatever but it also depends on the department of education because in our school we didn’t have a set curriculum because we were part of the National Consortium which is a more independent schools and so we pretty much had more choice in what we taught. I can’t speak for all art teachers but that’s how it was in our school and all the middle colleges around the country, which there are like 20 something of them now, they don’t teach a little more independently than traditional high schools. Johana: Do you still like to travel and go around? Sharon: I do, I just, now it just seems like time goes by so much faster like traveling is such a luxury, there is too much to do. Johana: Have you ever gone overseas and painted something? Sharon: Not to, not to make art but I’ve gone overseas. My daughter went to school overseas in London for a year and so we took some time and did a lot of traveling in Europe. Johana: That’s nice, where did she go? Sharon: She went to Oxford. Johana: Oxford. And, where did you guys travel to? Sharon: We went to a lot of places in England, we went to France, and of course if you teach art you have to go to the Louvre, so (laughter) I would really like to go back there. Johana: Would you ever go and just set up shop and paint over there? Or just… Sharon: I mean, I don’t know if I had connections I probably would. I don’t know if I’d have the nerve to just do it cold, but I wish I spoke more languages than I do but yea. Johana That’s cool, and can you tell me about your paintings? Sharon: I just finished writing a proposal for the Queens Council of the Arts, I want to do a series of paintings in a non-representational, like abstract paintings a lot of people confuse those two, but some large paintings in reaction about women’s position in society right now cause it’s changing and there’s a lot going on and there was a great article in the New Yorker called “The Canvas Ceiling” about women in the 50s and abstract expressionism and when I was in college and after college I painted almost exclusively abstract expressionist paintings and so that’s what I would like to pursue now again more so than, I did a series recently of a bunch of city-scapes of views of Long Island City that are not going to be available to people very soon because of the really fast development that happening in Long Island City. It’s developing faster than almost anywhere in the country and so a lot of the views that were around when I first moved here 20 years ago are no longer here so I took pictures of them. I did a series of paintings of those but they are very, I don’t know, traditional, they are not traditional but they are very, they’re city-scapes so they are very recognizable but that’s not how I usually paint. Johana: Can you describe abstract expressionism? Sharon: It’s mostly, it’s about, to me, I feel like it’s about the person being a conduit in a sense of it’s about the purity of the paint and the and using formal issues like light and depth and contrasts and that stuff, form, color to create an image that you can move into and around in and that carries some emotion with it. But, it’s hard to get into a space where you can make those, you really have to focus on making them repeatedly and to get into that space that you become somewhat of a conduit of your emotion, but it comes out in the purity of the color and its really, it’s hard to put into words but that’s how I see it and I just feel like this is a prime time to, as a woman and a mother and having grown up relatively independent very independent my whole life, I feel like I’m wanting that to come through in the paintings. It’s not necessarily anger as much as like incredulous that we are as women seem to be going backwards in our independence and I would I want to express that somehow but I’m not sure how it’s going to come out. Abstract expressionism is just what it says it’s just an expression that you have to work with and make the painting it’s not something where you have a predicted outcome. Johana: That’s nice, and how long does it usually take you to do a painting? Sharon: It usually, a, somewhere between a month to three months depending on you know the size and how it works out. Johana: And did you first start displaying your work here in the gallery or how did you end up here? Sharon: I ended up here because LICA is just a really great, LICA is Long Island City Artists, and they’ve been around since the 80s and they’re just a really great artist organization because they are non-profit. They have all the benefits of being with other artists, working with other artists and putting on exhibits and doing all the great stuff without having a share of the gallery world and the money making and the you know the, the weird competitive vibe that you get in other gallery scenes this doesn’t happen here the people are really amazing people who run it, it’s a great place to work. Johana: Have you displayed your work in other galleries around the country or….? Sharon: Not in New York, only in Cincinnati and a little bit in Ohio, nothing dramatic, but not really in New York like unless you count like the cafes and local venues nothing, no other galleries. Johana: And, what were your biggest inspirations in other artists or role models? Sharon: Yea I’ve always been like a big fan of the, of the abstract expressionist of the 50s and then again in the 80s. There were some great women you know like Grace Hardigan and different, Elaine DiCouning, people where, women who were really painters and the you know sculptors who, Louise Nebison who was a great inspiration and then there were France Klein, he had a show in the 80s that really changed how I saw painting, like he had a huge retrospective it was just amazing. And, a Pierce Doulage is a French painter and he is still hard at it and he is always his works have always been very inspirational for me. And, you know, and then there are people who are also very precise there is a lot of, print making is really popular in the school that I went to, so it was a really old school and I’m always, I always admire my mentors and how hard they work and how hard it is to do that, so there’s been, you know, inspiration from different places. Johana: Is there a difference between the 50s and 80s and what would be developed? Sharon: Yea, I mean, I guess they would, I don’t know, that for that new abstract expressionism, I don’t know, but I feel like with this it comes when the frustration gets, I really think that abstract expressionism is connected to the politics of the nation if not the world because it gets, I mean the 50s clearly came out of people were, you know, so much of the world was destroyed in World War 2 and then they were facing obliteration by the atom bombs everything had been taken, every choice people had seems to be spinning or society seems to be spinning a little out of control and were facing something, you know, just like in the late 40s when they faced the, you know, human annihilation by the atom bomb. Now we are facing annihilation by human annihilation by global warming and nobody seems to be paying enough attention and so I feel like there is this constant anxiety and dread that we are living with that has to be expressed, you know, in some form of art specifically. I feel like that’s when that comes around. Johana: Well do you think that art is specifically, I guess does society impact art in some way? Sharon: Yea, I think it goes both ways I think society really impacts art and art really impacts society. Like it’s just, you know, it’s a two way streak it goes back and forth I don’t know how exactly or at what rate it’s just clear, you know, and I mean I think that the whole commercial gallery instance, that whole, think of fancy paintings being shredded and now it’s worth even more money, that just happened recently. I mean the absurdities of the art market now are just, I mean, that’s a reflection of the uncertainty of the economy, you know, like money, you know, people can’t let go of the idea that money is everything. Johana: That’s true. That’s very true. And, have you ever sold any of your paintings or just displayed them? Sharon: No, I’ve sold work. I sold work in Cincinnati, some big abstract expressionist paintings I sold there that were, one that I was most proud of is I sold one to the director of fine arts acquisitions at the Cincinnati Art Museum so that made me very happy. I don’t know where it is now but, at the time, I was very, that was years ago, but and I’ve sold little pieces here and there over the years I mean nothing I can live off of but… Johana: And do you display them and people buy them or do they contact you to paint it for them? Sharon: Oh no. I don’t, I’ve never done commission work, it’s always been like people have seen something and wanted to buy it. I’m not sure I can do commission work that would be weird. I’m sure that would go wrong somehow. When I used to do portraits, when I was younger, you always do portraits when you are in art school or whatever and people always ended up looking 30 years older than they actually were and they would get mad at me so I don’t do that anymore. Johana: So, every art form is different for each person right like some people do better than others, so your strong point is the abstract one or have you…? Sharon: Yes, I think so I mean a lot of people like that series I did of the city-scapes but I also think that cause its very accessible, you know, recognize your neighborhood and you recognize the city in the background or whatever, and it’s just, you know, but those are more exercises in recording something that’s going to get lost, you know, and something that, you know, I was trying to deal with, I wanted to see the Long Island City train station in a more positive light and it’s not always the most easy thing, you know, construction is overwhelming when you live here but that was my ultimate goal. Johana: And what’s your weakest form of painting, just out of curiosity cause? Sharon: Oh, water color. Johana: Water color? Sharon: Water color that’s crazy. Johana: How come? Sharon: Because its, its backwards like the idea that your highlights are what you leave bear or your light is part of what you don’t put any paint on, like that’s just in my world, that’s a prescription for disaster because you can’t, I like to put paint on and take it off, put it on, and take it off, until I get it the way I want it. I struggle a lot with the paintings and with water color you don’t get that, you don’t have that option. Johana: You can’t take it off? Sharon: Yea you do it and its done and that’s like truly frightening. Johana: Do you ever get nervous before starting a painting? Sharon: No, I just get like dread, you know, I don’t want to start it because I just, I can’t, like once you start it, it goes but starting is definitely the hardest part. Johana: It is? Sharon: Yea. Johana: Do you have to picture your inspiration, what you want or does it just come with it? Sharon: I mean a little bit always in the beginning, you just have an idea but it never goes the way you think it’s going to go. Johana: No? It’s always something new. That’s nice. Do you ever get nervous when you are displaying them to people? Sharon: No, I’m always surprised by what people like and don’t like it’s you know. But no once it’s done it’s done, if people don’t like it its whatever. I get nervous when I’m in the middle of something and people and stuff, you know, like fellow artists or friends are like “what” you know they, they’re critical of a part and sometimes that’s very helpful but other times I’m just like it makes me nervous cause I don’t know with, whether to go with my instincts or do what they’re saying. I get confused but its good it’s always good to get criticism or feedback, what you call it, but once it’s done it’s done. I’m not that worried, it’s like move on. Johana: And your friends they do other types of paintings? Sharon: Some of them do, yea. I have a lot of photography, photographer friends and, I, lots of different types of work. Johana: Have you ever tried sculpting? Sharon: Yea, we had, I had to teach ceramics when I taught in the Ozarks which is not necessarily sculpture, that’s more like pottery and all of that, and sculpting is very hard. I did, I had to do a lot of it when you, when you go to an all, when you go to a fine arts school like a four year accredited fine arts school you have to do every kind of art and so I did have some experience with it, but I’ve never done it like I made some puppets at one time and I’ve done some like outlandish stuff but nothing traditional. Johana: And how do you, how do you get graded on art like when you go to a fine arts school? Sharon: All the teachers I had, were artists themselves and so they seem to have an idea of what they were looking for number one and what was especially, the painting teachers they knew exactly what you put into it they, knew the paint you used (inaudible) so if you weren’t committed they knew immediately and that’s basically what you get the most slack for just being (inaudible). Johana: Oh, so they would grade you based on your commitment to it or work you put? Sharon: Yea, like, you know, we definitely had people that they picked out as people that they thought were going the distance. They were, I used to think, in an art school that is strictly an arts school you, people feed off of each other’s energies and so it becomes clear quickly and it’s also like really, really critical like they were very critical like you know in freshman and sophomore year it’s like the teachers were, it seems like it was their goal to make you cry, yea. Everybody who didn’t end up running out crying at some point during their critique and you just had to, you know, suck it up and a lot of people drop out, you know, art school is not for everybody so that’s a good question. How do they know, they just seem to know and you just, you know, sometimes you disagree with them but for the most part they know, the other students know, they know what’s working and what’s not… Johana: So, do you also get graded on like if you have to do the same style do you get graded based on comparing each other or no? Sharon: No, because in a, in a, where I went to, my degree was in painting so there was no teaching of style you. You were taught like in your painting classes, you were taught like you would have maybe models we’d have to paint and whatever but it was all ours, they wanted our particular personal style, you know, they wanted to see our work, you know, they didn’t want us to follow any parameters the only ones that had real rules were the print makers but that’s just so that, they were all process rules but they were never like, we were never, except for when we had like specific still lives or models or whatever we were never required to produce anything, you know like, the same as anybody else. I guess I’m trying to say I can’t, I was going to say something but I can’t remember, forgot, go ahead. Johana: So, when you go to a fine arts school do they just teach you art or do you have to do like regular college work? Sharon: No, no you have to do English and Algebra and all that stuff, yea cause it’s an accredited, yea, algebra. And, I always told the kids when I taught high school that it’s like you can’t, you need to finish your math credits while you’re in high school you do not want to take algebra in college. Johana: That’s true. Sharon: Because you’re not going to get like Americans in English we don’t teach math in college because we are not smart enough we weren’t raised, we weren’t raised, we weren’t taught math the same way, we’re just, we just don’t have, you know, for what you can say like whether you think it’s not smart or whatever we are not comfortable for the most part. I know I’m generalizing, with math for the most part and those, every math teacher you get when you’re in college is just going to have some sort of accent and if you can’t, if you’re not comfortable enough, that’s going to make that class all that much harder, you know. So, it’s like you know, that was my, that was hard, college algebra but yea, you have to have all those courses and you know, and then you have, and you know you have in art school, there is a wide variety of teachers just like anywhere else. Teaching is something people do for a whole lot of different reasons so you never know what you’re going to get. Johana: Would you ever go on to teaching in college? Sharon: I taught a little bit in La Guardia Community College. It’s I mean it’s nice to have kids that are very interested but it’s also hard because I like to teach kids that are just getting comfortable with themselves or like learning to challenge themselves. Whereas, I’m not, I don’t necessarily like teaching kids that consider themselves art starts, you know, they just want to show you how good they are cause it’s like you want to send them off to art school, like college art school, so they can get ripped apart and have to learn what, how all the things that they don’t know. So, I prefer to teach kids who are, and I’ve always taught schools, in high schools, you know, art is a, one of the minor subjects. I’ve never taught in schools cause in New York, you have specialized schools like La Guardia School for the Arts or whatever and I’ve never taught in schools like that cause I prefer to teach kids who are having a harder time. Johana: Oh, that’s nice. Do you have to follow a certain curriculum when you’re teaching? Sharon: Oh, not in the school I taught, not in the high school I taught, like I said we were part of the consortium, we didn’t have to do that. But, I can’t speak for the other New York City public schools, I don’t know how that works exactly. Johana: How did you grade students? Sharon: Mostly I did, they all had, I gave them all sketch books and they had to, they had a set of assignments they had to do in their sketch books and I, a lot of times I graded them on how creative they approached the assignment, you know, how much risk they were willing to take, how much they looked outside the box and we always had big final projects and most of them, none of them, were about skill level, like you know, rendering, the ability to look at something and draw it the same way but that didn’t have anything to do with my grading which really made it made, the kids who thought of themselves, like you know, art starts, you know, made them mad. They grew up drawing manga, you know, all their lives were in a daze, they often didn’t get that, so that was that, but you got to get outside the box, you had to challenge yourself to get a good grade. Johana: That’s good and what was your final project when you were in college, what did you focus on? Sharon: Oh, in college we had to have a big show at the end and I did, I had a whole lot of large paintings, large expressionist, abstract expressionist oil paintings. I had, that was the final, we had a fine arts show, me and 3 other people in a gallery, we had to put on a big show and I sold some work that night so to sell work at that age. Johana: That’s nice, would you go back to teaching? Sharon: Maybe at some point, after I do some of my own stuff, I don’t know, maybe part time or maybe a, yea, I don’t know, that’s a hard question. I like it, I miss it, I miss the kids but it’s also like exhausting so... Johana: I could imagine, yea that’s nice. Do you have anything that you’re currently working on in here? Sharon: Yea, I’m working on, I’m finishing my series of the views of Long Island City views that and I’m also and when that’s done because those are going to be shown in a little gallery in December, I’m going to start on that big set of like feminist for lack of a better word, abstract expressionist, and hope that I get the grant to like, if I get the grant I’m going to immediately buy all the same size large canvases like put together a set of large canvases all the same size but that’s really expensive so if I don’t get the grant, I’m going to make the paintings on whatever I can cop together, you know, and you know. Johana: Art supplies are expensive? Sharon: Yea, they are. Johana: Very? Sharon: Yea. Johana: Where do you usually buy them? Sharon: I buy them at that place, at Artists and Craftsmen, it’s right there on 34 Street off of Queens Boulevard, its huge and people haven’t really, it’s really undiscovered yet. I think counting on Long Island City being blown up like everybody else is and they’ll have lots of business. Johana: And do all your friends display their work here or do they? Sharon: A lot of my friends do and then I also have friends who are in the, what do you call that, performance arts here. There’s also a performance arts part of LICA so there are plays and there are works sometimes you know. Last summer, I curated a big show that went with a play, a specific play so the art work around the gallery reflected the play’s big theme. Johana: What does it mean to curate a show? Sharon: You just decide where all the work goes on the wall like what goes with what, you know, which, how it’s going to display or whatever, which is an art form in itself, it’s not easy especially because artists are hard to deal with. Johana; I could imagine maybe somebody wants it in the front and its…a lot of that? Sharon: Yea. Johana: So what advice would you give to students now that are going through school and want to be artists? Sharon: Just, it’s a whole different world now with media being so much of a part of it so I feel like I’m much more in a world of traditional art making so I guess the advice I would give them is make sure you learn programs like photoshop and illustrator and rhino whatever the big programs are now that you keep abreast of that stuff because I haven’t and now there are things I want to do that I should have kept up to speed on cause it changes so fast but also its like trust yourself. That would be it, like if you really want to do something, don’t listen to people when they tell you not to do it and don’t do it based on whether you’re going to make money off of it or not cause it never really rings true in art, you know, you got it, do it because, you know, it sounds corny but you got to do it because you feel it, you can’t do it just because it’s the responsible thing to do…boring. Johana: And what advice would you give people that want to teach art? Sharon: Go do some other stuff first like do a whole lot, I give that advice to anybody that wants to be a teacher like I don’t think it’s healthy to go straight from college into teaching even if you go to teachers college because I feel like if you don’t have enough life experience you can’t relate to teenagers you got to have some life experience or you can’t relate to teenagers, a lot of them now are, they’re so many of them are going through so much stuff if you don’t, if you can’t, if you’re too busy trying to corral them into what you think they need to know and can’t see them for who they are, if you can’t meet them where they are, then you’re not going to get anything across from them. Johana: That’s true, that’s very true. Is there anything else you’d like to add? Sharon: No, I think I’ve talked a lot. Johana: Alright. ",

  "Theodore_Stephanie_timecode.txt": "“People don’t move to Sunnyside because it’s cool. This is the New York New Yorkers live in.” A native New Yorker, Stephanie Theodore moved from Brooklyn to Rego Park right after college. She hated it there and swore herself that she would never live in Queens again. “I’ll live in Manhattan from now,” she told herself. “This is where it’s at!” What followed were 17 years on Mott Street, where she lived in a six-floor-walkup and only communicated with her neighbors over disagreements and at co-op meetings. Slowly bankers, lawyers, brokers and trustafarians descended on the old Soho. When Stephanie fell in love with a man who owned a house in Sunnyside Gardens it wasn’t hard for her to leave. The relationship soon broke apart but her love for Sunnyside continued to grow. Its architecture, pubs and tight community structure reminded her of London, where she studied at Christie’s Education. In 2007 Stephanie bought an apartment on 46th Street. On the weekends, Stephanie still returns to Soho, where she owns a gallery. THEODORE:Art represents primarily British artists with whom she has fostered long and growing relationships. Stephanie describes her artists’ work as “aesthetically mature, well-crafted and appealing” but with a “conceptual and subversive agenda.” She shudders at the hype within the contemporary art scene and laments that many gallerists are more concerned with “packaging” and “surface” than with the work itself. The idealism with which Stephanie approaches her work as an art dealer mirrors her attitude toward her Sunnyside community. She does not want to live in a neighborhood submerged by (wannabe) hipsters and is happy to return to Sunnyside at the end of the day. “I have the best of both worlds,” she says. “It’s nice to get away and not have black-clad hipsters all around or business people or tourists. People don’t move to Sunnyside because it’s cool. This is the New York New Yorkers live in.” But Stephanie worries that Sunnyside’s Starbucks—a neighborhood’s “signifier of acceptability”—is the beginning of the end. Maybe real estate agents will invent a gimmicky name for Sunnyside (like when they dubbed her part of Soho “Nolita”)? And maybe wannabe hipsters will follow, clogging the streets with their “hipster babies in Sonic Youth t-shirts… Gag!” But Stephanie hopes that the existing nuclei of world cultures will continue to attract a steady stream of diverse immigrants with equally diverse professions and with people who appreciate this “neighborly neighborhood” for what it is.

She was born and raised in Queens and lived in multiple neighborhoods in the borough throughout her life. In this interview, Tammara discusses her influence on the Queens hip hop community and talks about her many interactions with some of the most important names from that era, including LL Cool J, Spyder D, Jam Master Jay and groups like Infinity Machine and the Disco Twins. In addition, Tammara opens up about her difficult childhood, including her time in shelters and group homes. 00:00:31: Tammara begins with a mention of the growing interest of historians in the hip hop culture in Queens. “Queens had their thing going on, too.” She was a part of this early hip hop community. 00:01:20: Tammara Tillman started rapping at the age of eleven. She says she was one of the youngest rappers of that era. 00:01:44: Tammara was born in East Elmhurst. She lived near Louis Armstrong when she was a baby. Her parents told her later on that Louis thought she was a beautiful baby. 00:03:29: Tammara describes East Elmhurst/Corona in 1970/71 as being a very diverse neighborhood. 00:04:00: Her parents migrated from the South. Her father was born in Augusta, Georgia. Her mother was born in Columbia, North Carolina. Her mother migrated to NY in the 1960s and met her father while living in Long Island with some aunts. 00:05:00: She describes her relationship with parents when she was little, particularly how her father was a very dominant man. 00:06:00: Her mother suffered from mental illness. She was a patient at Creedmoor Hospital in Queens Village. 00:06:00: Tammara and her neighbor, “Pee-Wee”, in Corona would make mudpies. Her recollections then circle back to the day her mother left her father and how it affected her father. Before her mother took Tammara and moved out, Tammara used to attend games at the Mets Clubhouse with her father. 00:08:19: After her mother left her father, they moved into a house with her mother’s friends on South Road. She and her mother ended up on 164th Street on the south side of Jamaica. They moved onto the same block with some of her mother’s cousins. 00:09:10: Tammara was a victim of childhood neglect. She was often left with neighbors. 00:11:38: Her mother moved them again to 187th Street in Hollis to an apartment in a two-family house. 00:12:05: Tammara attended P.S. 118 for elementary school. 00:12:10: Tammara found her love of music in old musicals that she would watch on a black-and-white TV. She particularly loved Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. 00:12:57: When she had lived in Corona with her mother and father, she was surrounded by music. Her father’s family was involved in music. They would often play music in the house. Her mother had been in a Baptist choir. This helped influence her love of music from early on. 00:13:30: Tammara talks about how her life was at 187th. She needed to adapt to different situations due to her mother’s illness. Her mom worked odd jobs. 00:15:25: When they moved down the block to 105-06 187th Street, Tammara had an attic room. She was raised as an only child, since her siblings lived elsewhere. 00:15:55: Her mother had gotten pregnant at the age of fourteen with Tammara’s older brother. This was when she still lived in the South. This was a big taboo at the time. 00:16:20: 187th Street was where Tammara was first introduced to hip hop and fell in love with the genre. 00:16:30: While attending P.S. 118, Tammara was a bright child and received high grades. Tammara compares her education with her mother, who never finished high school. 00:16:59: Her mother got introduced to Jehovah’s Witness. Tammara proceeds to talk about faith and the impact that it had on her mother’s mental health treatment. 00:17:55: School was an escape for Tammara. The school curriculum was excellent. In 5th grade, under her teacher Ms. Burgess, Tammara got into poetry. She was involved with the Double Dutch team at P.S. 118. 00:18:29: The kids on her block taught her how to ride a bike. The neighborhood kids would play like Hopscotch and Red Light, Green Light. 00:18:44: Tammara describes the early park jams she attended and how DJs would get electricity from light posts. Paul, one of the park DJs was one of the first DJs to influence Tammara. He and the other DJs would rap at the park jams. When Paul brought a girl from the Bronx to rap in 1975, Tammara was hooked. It started her love affair with hip hop. That year, Paul gave Tammara a chance at the mic. By 1976, she was well-known. 00:20:22: Tammara describes rapping at the age of eleven and how people were amazed at how she could “drop some bars.” 00:20:40: MCing for Tammara was an “out-of-body” experience. It was an escape from her home life. 00:20:59: She was a neighborhood favorite. 00:21:04: She remembers LL Cool J. They wouldn’t let LL on the mic but they would let Tammara on the mic. At that point, she was in junior high school. 00:21:30: Tammara circles back to her time at P.S. 118 and the jingles they would sing on her Double Dutch team. She talked about learning dances at P.S. 118. They had annual dance festivals where they would learn about different cultures. The school was on Farmers Blvd. 00:22:18: MCing impacted her friendships with girls in her 5th grade class. It made her stand out. She was a victim of bullying. 00:23:00: Her short height made her a target for bullying; however, it was also a subject for some of her raps. 00:23:17: Tammara mentions that she gave up rapping in 1992, but she is now restarting her career. 00:23:40: Tammara attended junior high at I.S. 238. She was bullied in junior high school as well. She describes one particular situation where a boy put a magnet on the radiator and put it on Tammara’s arm, like a branding. She also recalls a boy named Buddy who would tease her about her hair. She beat him up one day. 00:25:44: Tammara was involved in her junior high school. She ran for president of her school council. She was in a spelling bee. She was also on a dance team. Although she did well in school, Tammara struggled with her mother’s mood swings and the household abuse. 00:26:25: Dancing, MCing and music were Tammara’s escape. Tammara would sneak out of the house for park jams. 00:26:50: Tammara discusses her high reading and math levels in the 6th grade. 00:27:25: Tammara used to rap in the hallways and back staircases at her school. 00:27:40: Tammara describes her short temper and how it led her into fights. She was also very clumsy. 00:29:00: Tammara explains how she got transferred out of I.S. 238 around 1978. She had an argument with a girl named Tanya, which resulted in her beating up Tanya and trying to injure her with a compass. She got kicked out of school. 00:30:20: Tammara was transferred to I.S. 192 on 203rd street because of her behavior problems. 00:30:53: Nevertheless, Tammara was known around the school for her MCing. By then she had already established a reputation. Her cousins also DJed on the South Side of Queens. 00:31:11: Tammara was involved at 192 as well. She became a cheerleader. 00:31:50: Tammara was getting into a lot of fights by the age of 13. 00:32:00: She used to lie about her age to get into the popular Queens clubs, Fantasia and the Foghouse, for jam sessions. Tammara interacted with Future Sounds, Jamaica Sounds and other Queens MC crews at these events. MCing was done in parks, house parties, block parties. At this point, hip hop was widespread. 00:33:00: At this point in the interview, Tammara had a head cold and needed a break so we paused the interview. Part 2 resumed with Tammara talking about Hollis. 00:33:50: Tammara discusses how she unintentionally converted her mother to Jehovah’s Witnesses but later rejected attending services in order to attend jams. 00:35:00: At this point, she started going to jams outside of the neighborhood. Her cousins were DJing with Atomic Sounds. Tammara discusses her friends, Pam and Barbara, who were an important part of her childhood. 00:35:40: Tammara continued to have a difficult childhood. She would run away for whole days because of the beatings. Meanwhile, her mother was ignorant of Tammara’s MCing. 00:36:30: Tammara’s friend Pam helped Tammara get in contact with a group home. Pam also introduced Tammara to weed in 7th grade; Tammara didn’t like it at the time. 00:36:50: Her father didn’t drink or smoke. Her mother drank but she wasn’t an alcoholic; on the other hand, Tammara’s grandfather on her mother’s side was. 00:37:20: Tammara circles back to how Barbara would let her stay at the house. Her friend Pam lived on Hollis Avenue. 00:37:40: In 1979, Tammara moved into a group shelter called Queens Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children (QSPCC). This was in the second half of the eighth grade. It was located on Union Hall Street. She describes it like an orphanage. Children from all boroughs were sent there to stay before being transferred to other locations like Boy’s Town, group homes, or foster homes. 00:38:50: She talks about her cousin, Jamaica (Junior), who was involved in the gang Seven Crowns and was involved with the Savage Skulls. He had taught her how to fight. He found out that she was at the group home and would come to check in on her. He knew that she was a “dope MC”. 00:40:07: Tammara was a freestyle rapper in addition to writing rhymes down. She says she was one of the originals to do so. It was second nature to her. 00:40:17: Tammara circles back to her cousin, Junior, who made sure she was safe in the group home. He would also sneak her out so that she could MC at jams in the south side of Queens. 00:40:34: There were quite a few MCs at QSPCC. Tammara was generally quiet at the group home. DJs would come to the group home sometimes. She tells a story about how she asked to get on the mic for one of these sessions. She amazed the counselors at the group home with her raps. 00:41:50: Tammara talks about her continued strained relationship with her mother. 00:42:15: Tammara wound up in a group home on 203rd Street and Linden Blvd. 00:42:25: Tammara had female MC crew at the group home. 00:42:40: Pam moved to California. Years later, Tammara learned that Pam was murdered in California after getting into prostitution and drugs. 00:43:10: In 1982, Tammara went to Glover Cleveland High School. By then she was MCing all over Queens. 00:43:35: She and her friends rode the B53 bus to school. Her friends would bang on the back of the bus and Tammara would rap the whole bus ride to school. 00:43:50: Tammara recites one of her old raps from her bus trips. 00:44:28: Tammara was challenged to rap battles by the boys from Brooklyn. 00:45:00: Tammara talks about being a female MC and how she got a lot of attention for her rapping. She was smoking marijuana at this point and had started hanging out in Brooklyn. She had a large following. The attention was not necessarily good. 00:46:00: Tammara’s group home was co-ed. She would MC around the house. There was a DJ on the block who would take her to Springfield Park for jams. Tammara describes how the counselors at the group home would take the kids for activities like movies and roller skating. 00:47:20: Tammara recalls a dance marathon for a non-profit. It was the first time Tammara encountered Infinity Machine. Tammara MCed at the event. WWRL 1600 was there. Tammara won the marathon. She danced for 25 hours. She describes her encounter with members of Infinity Machine, including Divine and Goody. 00:49:10: Tammara describes the MC community as having been a “good ol’ boys club”. Despite the sexism, women still made major contributions to the hip hop culture. 00:49:50: Tammara describes winning a trip to what was the new Six Flags in New Jersey for her dancing at the marathon. She had gotten a shout out for her win and her MCing on the radio. 00:50:25: Tammara often had issues with the other girls at the group home. 00:51:25: Ms. Howard, one of the counselors at the shelter, was a woman who positively impacted Tammara’s life. 00:52:10: Jamaica, aka Disco J, and her other cousin had formed Atomic Sounds in the south side of Queens in Liberty Park. During this time, male DJs would go after Tammara’s female crew who were groupies, but she was protected by her two cousins. 00:53:10: Tammara and her crew got kicked out of the group home because they were missing curfews. The group home eventually became boys-only. 00:54:20: Tammara moved in with her friend, Barbara, and Barbara’s mother. 00:55:10: Tammara admits that women were underappreciated at jams. 00:55:40: Tammara describes an argument she had with LL Cool J. He was upset because she hadn’t passed him the mic. 00:55:55: Tammara talks about her encounters with Jam Master Jay. She met him through an ex-boyfriend, who was his best friend. He had proposed working with her. 00:56:38: Barbara’s mother became Tammara’s foster mother when she was 14. Barbara’s mother was not a great influence. She smoked weed with the kids. 00:58:08: Tammara had a crew called Epic Sounds in Hollis. She had been the only female MC for a long time in the MC community in Queens. She had recorded cassette tapes that went overseas. 00:59:33: Tammara talks about a counselor at the QSPCC who they discovered later on had been molesting boys in the shelter. 01:01:10: Tammara talks about rapping while under the influence. She says she could rap better under the influence, but after a while, it negatively affected her memory. 01:03:09: Tammara recites an old rap by the Little Man from the Bronx. She would battle with him in the kids shelter. 01:03:40: Tammara describes the different members of the MC crew, Future Sounds, including Eric and Lucius. She would often jam with them and, while her sessions with them were recorded, Tammara never got the tapes from her time with Future Sounds. 01:06:27: At this point, Tammara was well-known enough that she was hired for parties in Jamaica Estates. She would be paid for these events. 01:07:08: Tammara discusses how she evolved with the expansion of the MC community. 01:07:20: Tammara recalls an old rhyme from an earlier period and explains that rapping evolved away from that. 01:07:45: Tammara was around eighteen when MC records started coming out. 01:08:00: Tammara’s first studio was Power Play. She describes being nervous. She disliked the beat that the engineer had composed. She thought it was too flat and monotone. She could rap to anything, but she was more used to jazzy beats. One of her signature stylistic choices was Barry White. 01:08:40: Tammara was at this point branching out into the other boroughs. She was booked for clubs in Brooklyn, like Starlight. She would go to the Fever up in the Bronx. In Harlem, she would battle other females. 01:09:27: Tammara was much younger than the other DJs. 01:09:52: Tammara saw the evolution of hip hop. She knew that they were onto something. She discusses how the history of graffiti gets distorted. It wasn’t only the black kids who were graffiti artists. She says that white boys did her tagging. 01:10:45: Tammara describes a rap battle at Liberty Park in 1981, where she and her cousin in Atomic Sounds went against Cipha Sounds (Tony Moore). She describes hip hop jams as being about the performance, not just the material. She talks about Petey from Astoria Studios and how he got strobe lights in Liberty Park as part of the experience. She estimates there must have been 800 people in the park. 01:13:08: Tammara recites one of her old Shorty T raps. 01:14:00: Tammara mentions that some of her friends were B-boys and B-girls. 01:14:30: After the Liberty Park battle, Tammara’s cousin, Jamaica, left. He was on the run. She got in contact with him years later and found he suffered from a heroine addiction; he was mainlining. She tried to get him off but was unsuccessful. Once her cousin left, she was the last from her crew in Hollis. 01:15:10: Tammara lived at 190-25 Woodhull Ave. She would go to Jamaica Park jams. Spyder-D took notice of her then. 01:15:30: Tammara talks about being a female MC and how the girls would compete for attention. 01:16:30: Tammara talks about her association with Crazy T and the south side crew, Imperial 5 [spelling?]. Crazy T ended up getting strung out on crack. 01:18:20: Tammara brings up the crack epidemic which hit south side Queens. “It was terrible.” Crazy T was the first MC that she knew that died from it. 01:19:22: Tammara talks about her style of MCing. “When you’re really MCing, you’re in a flow.” She describes it like a natural high. Tammara had different ranges in her style, including the “old radio broadcast.” 01:20:10: Tammara was approached in Harlem by Sylvia Robinson’s “people” for her work. She was still at her foster mother’s house and at this time was concerned with finding a lawyer before agreeing to making records. 01:20:20: Tammara introduced hip hop to Grover Cleveland High School. 01:20:38: Tammara had a strained relationship with her foster sister who was jealous of her. Her foster sister was at the time into one of the Disco Twins, who she would MC with occasionally. But, it was still a “good ol’ boys club”. They would showcase the guys rather than the women. She says that the Disco Twins had another woman MC, Nasty T, with them at one of the parks near the Louis Armstrong School. 01:21:20: Tammara discusses the start of the Jamaica Armory gigs. The Disco Twins would MC there with Nasty T. She talks about meeting the Mercedes Ladies, including Sherry-Sher, Zina Zee, and Eve-a-Def. They had just recorded with Sugarhill Gang. Tammara was approached once again about making a record, but she was again concerned about having a lawyer. 01:22:15: Tammara circles back to her relationship with her foster sister and how she was jealous of the attention that Tammara was getting for her MCing, despite the fact that Tammara wanted to have her foster sister sing choruses for her in the studio. The competition between them became worse. 01:23:00: Tammara discusses stopping MCing briefly after getting sexually assaulted three weeks before her 18th birthday. Another time she had taken a break from MCing was when she was sixteen and her appendix had erupted. That time, she had been in the hospital for ten days. 01:23:33: MCing helped her through her childhood and teen trauma. It was an outlet, a self-expression for her. A mic was her source of healing. It wasn’t just “a thing to do.” 01:24:34: Tammara got a job after school at Western Beef to make money. She was still MCing, but her job took up her time. 01:25:19: Tammara was put out of her foster home when she was 18. At the time, Tammara thought it was a good thing since her foster mother could not afford the cost of a lawyer for Tammara. She was supposed to get a trust fund from her father, but because she was put out so suddenly, she never got it. 01:25:25: By then, Tammara had created a demo with one of the Disco Twins. Spyder-D had also taken Tammara to Power Play Studios. Tammara talks about Spyder-D’s involvement with drugs. 01:27:00: Tammara ended up in Flushing by Kissena Blvd. 01:27:20: Tammara circles back to explain how she introduced hip hop to Grover Cleveland High School. 01:28:10: Tammara had had an English project she didn’t complete, so she rapped for her presentation instead. 01:28:12: At this point in the interview, Tammara’s phone went off so the interview was paused. After she finished her phone conversation, Tammara began a story which the interviewer asked for her to continue on record. As a result, the interview resumed mid-story where she described what a jam was like. There was a DJ on either side of the park. They would take turns and whoever moved the crowd most would win. 01:29:00: By eighteen, Tammara was on her own. 01:29:20: Growing up, Tammara would use her anger towards her father to influence her raps. 01:29:30: Tammara recites one of her old raps. 01:30:40: Tammara talks about the impact of cocaine on her crew. She describes it as “having taken her crew.” 01:31:08: Tammara ended up on welfare for some time. 01:31:20: Tammara discusses the move from parks to venues for jams. Tammara argues that Queens was the first borough that had in-house MCs. 01:32:42: Jams at parks became dangerous with the growing drug problem in the MC community. Tammara discusses some of the more well-known gangs from the time, including the Black Spades which went from Bronx into Flushing. Seven Crowns was in Jamaica. Hip hop battles were supposed to replace weapons with words in fights between gangs, but the drug problem brought violence into the park jams. Cocaine and freebase coke made the clubs dangerous as well and changed the hip hop culture. 01:34:45: At this point in the interview, Tammara’s phone went off again so the interview was paused. It was decided that the interview would continue on a different day. The rest of her story can be heard on Interview Day 2 with Tammara Tillman. Tammara Tillman Interview Part 2 City: Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn Neighborhood: Elmhurst, Hollis, Jamaica, Flushing Date of Interview: April 29th, 2017 Time Period: 1980s-1990s Interviewee Date of Birth: November 23, 1965 Name of Interviewee: Tammara Tillman (aka Shorty T) Name of interviewer: Tabetha Karydas Length of interview: 1:34:45 Name of Editor: Tabetha Karydas Editing software: Adobe Audition Timecode Outline preparer: Tabetha Karydas Summary: Tammara Tilman continues her story about growing up in the MC community in Queens. Throughout this second interview, Tammara reflects primarily on the changes in the MC community during the crack epidemic. She discusses the losses in the community, as well as her own bouts with the addiction. Tammara reflects on the end of her MC career in the early 1990s and her recent decision to come out of retirement to work on her music once again. 00:00:53: Tammara begins to discuss the impact of the crack epidemic on the hip hop community in the 80s, starting with coke. Because Tammara was so much younger than the rest of the MC crowd, this initial wave of drugs did not impact her as much. She was sometimes three or four years younger than the rest of the crowd. 00:01:40: Crazy T, a significant contributor to hip hop from the south side of Queens was part of a group called the Imperial 5 [spelling?]. Crazy T’s cousin, Fat Cat Nicholas, was one of the “big-time” drug dealers in Queens. He brought a lot of the drugs to Queens. 00:02:25: Coke had been done casually until freebasing emerged and it became an epidemic. When crack became widespread it “broke families, lives apart.” It had huge repercussions for the hip hop community. 00:03:15: Her cousin Disco J (Street name: Jamaica) was a member of the Seven Crowns gang. Other gangs in Queens were the Nomads, and the Black Spades, though they were predominantly in the Bronx. Her cousin’s cousin Hubert Junior was a Black Spade up in the Bronx who brought the Spades to Flushing.

Her cousin, Jamaica, was shooting heroine and smoking crack. 00:06:07: Early on, Tammara wanted no part of it when she was in college. It made her feel like she was out of her body. She unintentionally smoked a joint and she did not like it. 00:06:53: Tammara talks about the falling out with her foster family when she was eighteen. She was turned out of the house on the day her trust fund was supposed to come through from her father and she never got it.

She stayed there for a month until she had enough money to rent a room off of 77th Ave. 00:10:50: Tammara dropped out of school six months before she was supposed to graduate.

She had stopped MCing. The man who had raped her preyed on her because she was a female MC.

Tammara found out later on that she had caught an STD. 00:13:00: Her foster sister told people about her STD. It was difficult to find the relief in MCing that she used to get because her foster sister had spread rumors about it. 00:13:39: In the early 1980s, following these incidences, Tammara went off on her own, bought her own place and enrolled in the Jamaica Learning Center. 00:14:09: Tammara talks about the B-boys from the Bronx.

She didn’t go to Jam Master Jay, due to her sexual assault making her hesitant around men. 00:15:20: Her best friend, Kim, was involved in crack as well. Tammara describes the different types of cocaine, including lacing joints. While Tammara describes herself as being a “pothead”, she had refrained from doing these harder drugs because she saw the impact it had on others. 00:16:10: She met Chris Curry in college. He used to work for the Amsterdam News. She used to freestyle rap in college and Curry wanted her to do a jingle for a lotto commercial. 00:17:17: Tammara had an anxiety attack being in the proximity of three men due to her sexual assault. She had difficulty with the verses of the jingle as a result. She was able to recite the verses when they were not in the room.

Her landlord illegally evicted her. 00:18:21: Tammara tracked down her godmother, Teresa, who was living on Jewel Ave. At this time, Tammara was doing business with the Disco Twins. One of the twins liked her godmother. 00:19:15: Tammara witnessed hip hop going mainstream. People from Queens had expected her to make it big. But her rape and the loss of her father’s money negatively impacted her and put her in a bad place. 00:20:07: Because Tammara was unable to take all her belongings to her godmother’s house, she put her things into storage in Flushing on Kissena. The man who had put her stuff into storage died due to his drug addiction. She has not seen that stuff since. 00:21:00: She submitted a demo to Russell Simmons that she had done with one of the Disco Twins. 00:21:19: The hip hop industry was chiefly male. It was difficult for women to get into it, especially in Queens, where there was less camaraderie than there was up in the Bronx. Tammara was discouraged. 00:22:14: Tammara moved around but ended up in Far Rockaway with her mother and her older brother. While she attended Interborough, Tammara worked for an electronics manufacturer called Concord for a year and a half. 00:23:18: Tammara discusses the MC community in the Rockaways.

He was in the fashion and music industry. He introduced Tammara to a man named Tony. Tony and Tammara worked on jingles together. William Hardy ended up strung out on crack. It was difficult finding someone to work with that did not have a drug problem. 00:25:50: Tammara talks about her own use of cocaine and other drugs.

One of the owners, Junebug, was murdered. 00:41:15: Tammara compares the Bronx to Queens. “Queens has a different culture of its own.” Queens residents are bougie, especially from the residential areas. 00:42:58: Tammara discusses how sexual assault impacted her life. 00:43:50: The shelter system was where the crack epidemic was most evident. 00:44:30: Tammara got her apartment in the Bronx through Partnership for the Homeless.

  "Tirado_Nilda_timecode.txt": "Nilda Tirado has lived with her mother and sister in the Waldheim neighborhood in Flushing since 1972 when she and her sister Rosa Tirado bought their house. This was due in part to an anti-discrimination law that had just passed, allowing women to get mortgages. They were the first Puerto Rican family in the neighborhood at a time when Ms. Tirado believes Puerto Ricans had a bad reputation in New York City. After a cautious beginning, their neighbors soon accepted the Tirados as part of the community. There are major conflicts around the increase in development in the area, the razing of houses, building of condos, and subway cuts. Ms. Tirado has experienced aggressive real estate developers who try to buy her house and encroach upon her property. Other changes occurring in the area include heavier traffic congestion on Main Street. Ms. Tirado participates in her local community board to address these issues and advocate for improvements that will serve the people, not the developers. Other changes are due to waves of immigration in the area. Currently there are many Asian immigrants who own local businesses. Ms. Tirado says residents are frustrated when shopping at these stores because the signs are not in English and they are told varying prices of goods. However, she says that diversity is good for the area and is one of the aspects of Flushing that she likes. Although Ms. Tirado is not in favor of many of the changes happening in Flushing, she has not considered moving because she owns her house, likes the hospitals, and takes her aunt to church nearby. She voices concerns about the future and worries that there is a lack of infrastructure and planning to support the increasing population.

Not just in Jamaica estates but in south Jamaica as well. In the early to mid 70’s south Jamaica, Hollis, St. Auburn these areas started to become more Hispanic and black. 00:03:06 mid 1980’s had the first person shot. That’s when things started to get bad. The infiltration of the crack crisis. There were gangs like the supreme team. Crack didn’t hit the scene until 84-85. The supreme team used to tell people this is our corner now and if you were there later they killed you. 00:09:47 In early 1975 Dennis Trotter made his own DJ system. He realized that he still needed a base and made one out of a little flower pot in his house. Then one day he was using it and he realized that both side turners were playing. 00:11:20 My friend that lived across the street Ralf McFarland. He went into the marines but when he came back in about 1977 he said we were going to do something big. Then in 1979 they started selling commercial mixers in Jamaica and we went out and bought one. My first group was RJ Ralf junction but I was just a Dj/ mixer. The group I first started really playing with was atomic sounds.

So we decided to go after some of the biggest rappers. We had an Mc Sweet Tea come in for us one day. Whenever we did a show we practiced for two days before. We set a standard as far as queens goes. The battles brought peoples best game out. 24:03 At the end of the summer Atomic sound kind of fell apart. One of the main people fell apart Honcho who I called Bill Blast or Grandmaster Funk. Got death threats from other rappers and decided he was leaving at the end of the summer. And right now I DJ with my Ipad. 29:02 One of the most famous first raps was Jack and Jill. And then it went to other thing “Jack and Jill went up the hill Jack fell down and broke his crown.” The whole mixing and playing music continuously came later and became rapping in the early 70’s. 1979 was the first time rap was played on the radio. 39:30 Record Explosion (record store) opened up on 168 street and Jamaica ave and for 99 cents we were buying these giant singles.

Many of us actually have come to this country to study. We have people who are getting their MD degree, their PhD degree, and their higher education. And they stay here for that. And some of us are immigrants, mostly from Taiwan. We are Christians. Many of us in Taiwan are Presbyterians. And now we have joined RCA and our church members come from Westchester, Staten Island, and Long Island, around the Tri State area. We come here to worship and also we try to provide a home for our children. Once they are in their individual community they don�t really have the kind of Taiwanese home base to grow up with. Many of them have adapted to the local environment. And some of them � the local environment may not be very suitable for them as Taiwanese; so as a church movement we like to provide worship, and bible studies, and apart from sharing the common faith in Christianity, we also have the [�] for the Taiwanese identity. Aside from the main church where we use Taiwanese for worship, we also translate it into Mandarin. Many of the people come from China and they are also looking for a place for worship. We also have an English mission, where some of them have grown up and are professional now. We also welcome neighborhood people to come to us to worship. Initially we think that they should become an independent church and have two independent churches but they decided they wanted to be connected to us, so we still have them as an English mission. So we have this Taiwanese church and the new building for the English Mission. We have pastors over there. I came in 1964. I went to study in Ohio. Then I got my degree and became a professor in Brooklyn College, part of CUNY. And three years ago I retired so now I have become more active in the church. We also have a photography group. This group is going to have an exhibition this coming Tuesday, and it�s very special because all the photographers are women. We thought that a female can have their viewpoint of the world�they are much more sensitive about their environment. So we encourage them to put up shows. This time they have flowers, scenery, Disneyworld, different places. Our Church members are very into the future of Taiwan too. So next week we�re going to have an activity for Taiwan freedom� �Keep Taiwan free�, at the UN. We are very active in trying to maintain Taiwan�s identity as a nation. It�s a long struggle but its hopeful�to get into the UN that�s a different story, but to remain as a government/autonomous, unless they come and bombard us or something. ",

  "Tubo_Elai_timecode.txt": "Elai Tubo was born in Jamaica, Queens, and lived at 175th Place in Jamaica. His mother and father were separated so he lived with his mother and grandmother. He lived in a black neighborhood and they would look after each other. He went to a private school where he was taught valuable lessons. Elai Tubo started off as a DJ working in clubs in 1971, then later as a record director, recording engineer, and producer. He has engineered and produced R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock & Roll, and Reggae; but what he is known for is for his contribution to what�s called the �golden age� of hip-hop during the 1980s to the early 1990s. At the age of two Elai knew how to play congas, he understood how music affects people and has worked with artists such as Run DMC, Russell Simmons, Kurtis Blow and many others. In 2012 he got his degree in sociology, and is now moving into historical lectures on the music business and hip-hop. In this Interview, Elai talks about his journey from his DJ life to a producer. He talks about different aspects of DJ�ing, and people he has worked with and hip-hop. 00:01:04 Elai Tubo started off as a DJ working in clubs in 1971, then as a record director, recording engineer and producer. He has engineered and produced records during the golden age of hip-hop. He received his degree in sociology in 2012. 00:05:29 Elai describes the golden age of hip-hop and the role that hip-hop played in dealing social problems, violence and beefs between people in the black society. 00:11:01 Elai was born in Queens. He lived in 175th PL, Jamaica. His mother and father were separated so he lived with his mother and grandmother. He lived in a black neighborhood and they would look after each other. He went to a private school where he was taught valuable lessons. 00:15:03 Elai knew how to play congas at two. He understood how music affects people and talks about the expression of hip-hop and what hip-hop means to him. 00:20:25 Elai DJ�d in the clubs instead of in the park for 14 years because he wanted people who payed to know him. He talks about having consistent crowd, learning which record works and which doesn�t work from DJ�ing. 00:23:13 Elai talks about the reasons he wanted to be in the studio and talks about mixing a record to make it better. 00:28:19 Elai talks about how DJ�s started to replace bands and how records that were played on the radio influenced the people that listened and the DJ. 00:34:30 Before rappers would rap with microphone, everyone would talk on the microphone and then MC�s rocked the party. 00:35:15 Elai discusses how historically black people who are known to create an art form such as tap dancing, jazz or hip-hop and then are not given credit for it. He discusses people stealing creative ideas, and songs and taking them as their own - and hip-hop being revolutionized and claimed by like Kool Herk and people in the Bronx. 00:41:31 People in Queens had bigger sound systems, but rappers in the Bronx were rocking the party better than the rappers in Queens and the rappers in Queens were mimicking them. Elai discusses where hip-hop started and some people thinking they created it or they created a new form of music. 00:51:08 Elai talks about enrolling for the �Seek Program� when he went to Queens College, his relationship with hip-hop and the people who became famous such as RUN DMC and LL Cool J. 00:56:15 Elai discusses why people didn�t like hip-hop as much as when they were younger, the human experience when the music is played and not caring about where or when hip-hop was created. 00:59:36 Elai talks about his experiences when he was a studio engineer in France, a cultural festival that was held in Queens College the year he graduated, and the reason why he is a good DJ is because he knows when people are telling him they want something. 01:04:32 Looking back, Elai wished he had his name on a record and talks about what he wished he was or had looking back. Elai reflects back on his life, things he has learned and the level of success that the people he has worked with have had. 01:15:10 Elai talks about the time when he was the first DJ to play hip-hop on a daytime radio. Elai Tubo second Interview on May 17 00:01:06 Elai talks about what music means to him and how music affects our lives. 00:04:31 Elai gives his opinion on Psychoacoustic and talks about effect of music in our feelings. 00:08:02 Elai was concerned with how hip-hop was being defined as criminal element, the gangsters being defined as hip-hop. Elai talks about the things he wants to learn coming back to school. 00:14:54 Elai�s best experience was being in the studio and recording, he loved the studio environment. 00:17:28 His first record that went big from Powerplex studio was a scratch record by Davey DMX, working with Run DMC�s first album. People flew him overseas wanting to work with him. 00:20:21 Elai gives his opinion on the definition of hip-hop and compares his generation to now. 00:24:15 Elai talks about the money deal between artists and record companies. Elai talks about hip-hop having a rebellious nature and people connecting with the artist, and hip-hop not being the same as how it was back in the day. 00:27:20 Artists back in the day did not have the structure to expose their music like we do right now with iTunes, YouTube and the internet. The artists back in the day had to fund themselves and market themselves. People used the radio as a medium to listen to music, while people nowadays can search up any music they want. 00:32:30 New York was the mecca of clubs, Elai not having a sound system of his own worked in a club where they had a sound system. Elai wasn�t like other DJs who played in the parks and battled each other; he wanted to just focus on how he can mix better than other DJs. Elai was asked by record companies to mix with their records, he says that in order to be good DJ you had to buy new records and develop relationships with record companies. DJ�ing was a way for Elai to get into the music industry. 00:40:00 Elai wanted to be out of the club that he was DJ�ing at because of the violence that was happening at the club. 00:42:15 Elai says New Yorkers are able to get exposure to a lot of things from all over the city, but certain people look at hip-hop as in sections where artists would talk about putting barriers in their borough from letting people from different boroughs come. Elai discusses the notion of who did it first in hip-hop and how he sees hip-hop. 00: 50: He talks about the time when he went on a tour with Kurtis Blow and talks about why hip-hop didn�t start in the Bronx. 00:53:18 Elai talks about the racism (sexism?) between male and female rappers when hip-hop first came out and how hip-hop became cultural open to everybody. 00:55:14 Elai discusses what hip-hop is to the youth, hip-hops growth and talks about working internationally. Elai has a problem with disrespecting people and women in hip-hop and acknowledges the youth to voice up. 00:59:00 Elai talks about the importance of human experience and not so much on the art form. 1:02:57 Elai talks about why the music industry gave him and everyone hope because for anyone that didn�t make it out of High School, College and went to jail hip-hop was a way that gave hope. Elai believes that the hope has been snatched away because you could get music for free nowadays where you had to buy it back in the day. 01:08:38 Elai talks about the representation of hip-hop to him and the effect of hip-hop to the world.

  "Twomey_Mary_timecode.txt": "Mary Twomey was born in the farmland of County Kilkenny at a time of great poverty; she was one of nine children, and when she was 6, her mother died. At the age of 11, she traveled alone to New York to begin a new life with an aunt and uncle she had never met. In this interview, she tells the story of her very different life in the U.S. – living in Woodside, traveling into Manhattan for school and dancing lessons, and eventually marrying and raising a family of her own in the same Queens neighborhood. Mary treasures her close relationships with her siblings, most of whom eventually joined her in the U.S., and is gratified to see much improved circumstances for her family who remained in Ireland during her numerous visits there over the years. 00:00:17 Mary came to the United States from Ireland in January 1950, by airplane. She remembers having all new clothes for the trip and traveling alone; she got sick at a stopover in Newfoundland but continued on to New York and was met by two aunts and an uncle. She was 11 years old. 00:02:45 She was one of nine children, and her mother died when the oldest was 12 and the youngest was 2; Mary was 6. She lived with other family members in Ireland for several years. An aunt in the U.S. wanted to bring one child over but not a boy because of the mandatory military draft, so Mary was picked as the one to come to America. She doesn’t recall feeling afraid, and said she was never lonely here. 00:06:30 Her first impression of New York was of all the cars and lights; she had only ridden in a car once or twice in Ireland. There were traffic jams even back then! Her aunt and uncle lived in Woodside; her aunt came to the U.S. in the 1920s and her uncle served in the U.S. Army in World War I. Her aunt used to say that her uncle had shell shock and didn’t like loud noises. Her uncle didn’t go back to Ireland to visit until 1963, though her aunt may have visited when she single. The family was doing much better financially at that point. 00:11:58 Mary’s family is from County Kilkenny; it was all farm country back then. People would farm almost everything – potatoes, corn, wheat, turkeys, chickens. Now it is only large milk farms. 00:13:17 When Mary came here, she most missed her cousin who was two years older than she; they are still close. Her cousin entered the convent shortly after Mary emigrated. Mary attended National schools in Ireland as a child. 00:15:40 School in America was different than in Ireland. She was put into fourth grade (4B) when she should have been in sixth grade, but a nun worked with her to catch up. She doesn’t remember ever being bullied or teased in school. She attended St. Mary’s Winfield in Woodside. 00:18:30 The landlord didn’t want children in the house, so her aunt and uncle bought a house in Maspeth. Her aunt worked outside the home. 00:20:30 Mary went to high school at St. Michael’s in Manhattan starting at age 14. She took the bus and subway by herself to get there. Her teachers were Irish Presentation Sisters, a semi-cloistered order. Her aunt wanted her to go to college, but she decided to go to Wood secretarial school near Grand Central Station. She attended Wood for a year, during which she met her future husband. Afterwards she got a job as a secretary with Parade magazine for about a year and then went back to Ireland for a five-month visit. 00:24:08 Mary had a great time visiting with her siblings back home but came back to New York to get married. Her husband was born in the U.S. but spent part of his childhood in Ireland, during World War II. Her mother-in-law had a shop in Dublin but the children lived with family in the country to avoid the bombings. Her in-laws were from the Cork and Limerick area. 00:27:39 Mary had three children within three years after getting married. She did not return to Ireland again until her 40th birthday. [END OF FIRST RECORDING SESSION] [BEGIN SECOND RECORDING SESSION] 00:00:00 When Mary’s father was in declining health, she and her siblings agreed to each spend a few weeks with him; she was married 20 years by then and had five children. She has also been back to Ireland several times on tours, and to see her granddaughter participate in Irish music and dance competitions. 00:01:36 All but one of Mary’s siblings eventually emigrated to the U.S. and settled in the Woodside/Maspeth area. Her older sister came in 1955 and helped bring the younger siblings over. Her brother Patrick went back to live in Ireland for a while in the mid-1970s, but eventually returned to the U.S. 00:04:35 Mary has five children; three live in the New York area, one is in Florida and one in Colorado. She stayed home to raise her children for 20 years, then started working as a secretary at St. John’s University when her daughter entered college. She got free tuition for four of her children there. It was difficult at first to work while still taking care of her children; she often slept in the campus chapel during lunchtime. 00:08:00 Of Mary’s four children who attended St. John’s, two became accountants, one is a special ed teacher, and one went into human resources. 00:10:00 Since her children have grown up, Mary has had time to enjoy Irish set dancing. She dances in Long Island City, Yonkers, Mineola and Plainview. She also belongs to a book club. Her oldest son bought her a condo in Florida and she spends three months a year there in winter; several of her siblings have condos in the same complex. 00:12:48 When Mary’s children were young, she taught them Irish rebel songs. The night before her son Eamon was born, in 1972, was Bloody Sunday. One of her sisters was very involved in the Irish civil rights movement, and Mary became involved as well. She participated in fund-raising and protests and included her children too. Her family sponsored several children from Northern Ireland. 00:16:37 Not all of her siblings were politically involved, but Mary came from a pro-IRA family. Her father and uncles were involved in the events of the 1920s, and her father-in-law was imprisoned for a time in Ireland. He had a brother who was killed by the Black and Tans. A lot of men of that generation came to the U.S. because of the strife. She and her family supported the Holy Ghost Fathers through their dances, especially in Long Island City. 00:19:54 Mary has a number of grandchildren, and she hopes they will learn more about their Irish heritage and how important the Catholic faith was to her family. She was poor as a child and grew up very differently than her own children did, and now her grandchildren are growing up in even greater affluence. As a child in Ireland, living with her aunt and uncle, she was often alone but used to play shop with herself. Her uncle gave her a bike, and she learned how to ride by going down a slope in the field. She says her siblings had a tougher time growing up; her father was a disciplinarian and gave them a lot of responsibilities after their mother died. They were very poor and were given a hard time at school. 00:26:30 Her siblings were happy to come to the U.S. Most of them had four or five children, and there are a total of 35 grandchildren among them. [END OF SECOND RECORDING SESSION] [BEGIN THIRD RECORDING SESSION] 00:00:30 Mary had a wonderful aunt here in the U.S. who became like a mother to her and her siblings. She always hosted Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners.

  "VanDamDiBella_Helen_timecode.txt": "Helen Van Dam DiBella grew up in Bayside as one of six siblings. She describes her childhood as �poor but happy,� with street games, radio shows and the movies for entertainment. World War II was most apparent to her in the neighborhood air raid drills, the ration stamps she took to the market to buy sugar, and the Victory Garden in which her father grew vegetables. Both of her brothers served in the Army during the war years, and she recalls the many soldiers stationed at Fort Totten who spent their off-duty hours strolling on nearby Bell Boulevard. 00:00:17 Helen Van Dam DiBella grew up in Bayside and was a child during World War II. She remembers hearing about the war on the radio but was too young to understand most of it. 00:00:55 Her older brothers, John and Henry, were both in the Army during the war. John served overseas, but Henry was stationed in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, because of his heart murmur. 00:01:40 John was a [U.S. Army Air Force] tailgunner and was wounded during combat. He served at one point in Hawaii and brought back many souvenirs, including a pearl ring that she still has. He wrote to his mother often. 00:03:18 [Referring to photo of John, in uniform.] John was a staff sergeant; he came back home at the end of the war. 00:04:03 [Referring to photo of Helen as a child.] Helen, at age 5, is standing in an empty lot across the street from her home. Later, it became a Victory Garden in which the local residents, including Helen�s father, grew vegetables. He was too old to serve in the war himself. 00:05:10 She remembers air raids during the war; her brother John was an air raid warden before he joined the Army. During air raids, people had to turn off all the lights in their houses unless they had blackout shades, which her family did. In school, there were drills in which the children hid under their desks. She says the drills were �scary,� but most people didn�t really think they would be bombed. 00:06:35 Helen�s oldest sister, Eleanor, worked in the library during the war years. She doesn�t recall a lot of women working at that time; most of the women in her neighborhood were older. A lot of the young men were in the service and she recalls only �old men� being around. 00:07:40 Because of Fort Totten, there were always many soldiers in Bayside, socializing on Bell Boulevard. Mostly they were from out of state, especially the South. 00:08:47 Helen remembers ration books with stamps for buying items such as sugar. Her mother sent her to Bohack�s for groceries with the stamps. Her older sisters had difficulty buying nylon stockings. 00:10:20 Her family, like many in the neighborhood, had a little banner in the window with two stars, representing her two brothers in the service. If a family member was killed in action, the banner would have a gold star. 00:11:22 She attended P.S. 31 until sixth grade, then P.S. 130 for seventh and eighth grades; she walked to both schools but 130 was further. Then she went to Bayside High School, which was an even longer walk. She did not visit Fort Totten until she was a teenager, when she went with a friend to visit someone. 00:13:00 In her neighborhood, there were big, four-family houses like the one she lived in, and �everybody was kind of poor.� There were a lot of Polish and Black families in her area, and drinking was common among the men. There were also a lot of feral cats. In the summer people would build a fire outside and roast potatoes. Everyone had porches and sat out at night. People listened to radio shows: The Lone Ranger, Inner Sanctum (a mystery show), The Green Hornet, and �Mrs. Goldberg� [The Goldbergs]. Very few people in the neighborhood had a telephone when Helen was a child. 00:15:41 She remembers going to the movies in Bayside on Saturday mornings; there would be cartoons, a weekly serial, two movies, and a newsreel. There were fans but no air conditioning. She recalls sometimes going with a friend and her mother, who would bring bologna and bread and make sandwiches in the theatre. They also bought candy, ice cream and soda there. She went with her friends starting around age 10. Her mother would give her a quarter to go if she had it; some weeks she wasn�t able to go. 00:17:42 When Helen was very young, her family was on welfare, and people sometimes brought them baskets of food. Many of her neighbors were also on welfare. Helen�s father was a house painter and kept a lot of paint in the basement. He loved to garden and grew flowers in the front and back yards; gladiolas were his favorite. 00:19:17 In their four-family house, two other tenants were always the same, but one apartment changed hands often. Everyone got along within the house and in the neighborhood; she doesn�t recall any fighting or tension between ethnic groups. The only crime she remembers was a man who roamed the neighborhood at night with no pants on and looked in people�s windows. One night her brothers chased the man but he was never caught. 00:21:37 Her family did not have a car and none of them drove. One tenant upstairs had a car; he sometimes took them for rides and let them sit in the rumble seat. There was a rag man who came around the neighborhood with a horse and carriage, and an ice man who sold blocks of ice for ice boxes. Her family didn�t get milk delivered; Helen remembers drinking tea and coffee, even as a child, with evaporated or condensed milk. 00:23:36 Children in the area played games in the street such as red light, green light; hide and seek; kick the can; and jumping rope, including double Dutch jumping. They also played stoop ball. 00:25:12 [Referring to photos.] In one picture, Helen is a teenager, sitting on a picnic table in Crocheron Park. Other photos are of her older sister Hazel. She worked at a bakery in Bayside [the Bell Blvd. Bake Shop] and earlier at the Ideal Toy factory [in Hollis?]. Hazel sometimes brought young Helen dolls from the factory. When she worked at the bakery she brought home leftover cake each night, which they had with their tea. Another photo shows Hazel shoveling snow across the street, in front of their landlords� house. 00:28:03 Helen�s sister Hazel eventually married a soldier she met from Fort Totten (after World War II). Many girls from town dated the soldiers but she doesn�t remember anyone else marrying a soldier. Helen�s father worked for the WPA at one point, making roads. 00:29:39 The neighborhood where Helen grew up was essentially the same by the time she moved out in 1954. She lived near Northern Boulevard, so there was easy access to Flushing and Jamaica via bus. When she was a teenager, she went to both towns for the movies and shopping. They didn�t really go into Manhattan, and only went to Long Island when her brother-in-law Lou drove them out. 00:32:11 Helen remembers being happy as a child despite being poor; food was not plentiful but they didn�t go hungry. She thinks the family went to St. Robert [Bellarmine] Catholic church. On Sundays, she recalls listening to the music from a Black church across the street. 00:33:53 The house where she grew up was �old� when Helen was a child and she�s surprised to learn it is still standing. It had no heat; they had a kerosene stove in the living room and a coal stove in the kitchen. The coal was delivered and kept in a bin in the basement. There was also no hot water; it had to be heated for washing. Her mother used a washboard to do laundry. ",

  "Vinson_Nancy_timecode.txt": "I�ve lived in this neighborhood 30 years. A lot of new businesses have come into the area over that time. It�s always been safe. I used to come home all hours, and always felt safe. My parents came from Puerto Rico and worked in factories. I was born in Manhattan. I used to work at Sachs Fifth Avenue. I come here with people from the neighborhood. I go to the church near here. My kids I had in the Bronx many moons ago. I came here when my kids left home, and I wanted to get away from an area that wasn�t safe to be. I told my mother I just can�t stay here. And so I came over here. Somebody told me about Astoria, and there was an empty apartment, so I thought I�ll take it (on 29th Street). I�m still there. Sure I�m going to stay here � as long as I can climb up five flights then I see what happens. At Sachs I was a sales lady in shoes. You meet a lot of nice people; you meet a lot of celebrities. Well one time I saw Jackie Gleeson. But most times the celebrities used to have personal shoppers. They would go into a special room and try them on, and then ship them to a hotel room or whatever. After so many years working it�s good to be retired. I go to some of the senior centers where they have music and dancing or play bingo, and I volunteer by helping collect the money. ",
  "Walker_Akili_timecode.txt": "Akili Walker an Audio Engineer since 1973 has over 150 albums to his credit and has recorded or toured with acts like Prince, Cameo, Brass Construction, Eddie Kendrick�s, LL Cool J, Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, and hundreds more. Summary: (Steven) Akili Walker was born in Queens General Hospital on 164th street. His family then moved to Freeport, Long Island. His family was the first African Americans to move into a white neighborhood. In Freeport there were two sides - a black side and a white side, but Akili never felt he faced racism, and had both black and white friends. At a young age Akili began exploring New York City, he would go to Manhattan from Long Island to visit his grandmother and to watch shows in the Apollo 5 Theater by himself. Akili went to the Freeport High school until ninth grade, but didn�t like it and left at age sixteen. He then went to a school in Massachusetts, and finally found a school in Brooklyn called Uhuru Sasa run by a Black Nationalist organization which he liked. At nineteen he became interested in learning to work with sound when he saw his friends using the sound board at a jazz show happening where he worked. After a while he was asked to go along on road shows with musicians as a sound engineer. He became interested in working in the studio after working with the Jimmy Castor Bunch, and decided to go to recording school to expand his skills, eventually being offered a job in a Manhattan studio. He began by working with two senior engineers, and later began to work on his own with musicians and artists such as Prince, and LL cool J. Throughout the interview, he talks about his life in the beginning, going on tours with artists, Hip-Hop and music of other genres. 00:00:28 Akili Walker was born in Queens General Hospital 164th Street. He lived in Queens until he was five and then moved to Freeport, Long Island. 00:01:02 The Walkers were the first African American family in the neighborhood. There was a black side and a white side of Freeport, but he never faced racism and had both white and black friends. 00:01:49 Akili loved exploring New York City, and he would travel to Manhattan at the age of ten from Long Island to visit his grandmother. At thirteen he would go to see music shows at the Apollo by himself, he saw the Jackson Five before they were popular at a competition there. 00:03:14 When traveling to Manhattan the stations would have candy machines and bathrooms. Once you got out of the station there were lots of drug addicts. 00:04:56 He says that Manhattan has progressed a lot from the time when he was young till now especially the �ghetto� places from the old days. He says Long Island now is no longer a binary between blacks and whites because people of different races are now living in the area. 00:08:05 He attended Freeport High School until the 9th grade and left traditional high school at 16 because he never really liked school. He then went to a school in Massachusetts where he did not feel accepted. He ended up at a school he liked called Uhuru Sasa in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn, which was run by a Black Nationalist organization. 00:09:18 In that school, he was asked to be a teacher for five and six year old children, even though he didn�t have a degree, because the school was looking for people that the kids could relate to and look up to. 00:11: 28 At nineteen while he was working at The East, (an Afrocentric cultural center and school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn that had weekend jazz), he saw his friends working with a mixing board which controlled the sounds and he knew what he wanted to do with his life. 00:12:07 He learned how to control and make new sounds from his friends while working at The East during shows. (Weekend jazz shows at The East featured the likes of Betty Carter, Roland Kirk and Sun Ra.) 00:12:19 Akili was asked to go on a road show as a sound engineer with the musician Lonnie Liston. Akili thought of himself as a professional [sound engineer] from going on the road with Lonnie and many other musicians. 00:14:18 There were not very many sound black sound engineers in the 70�s, and while touring with musicians, Akili wasn�t taken seriously as a sound engineer in the clubs; they always thought he was a brother or a cousin of the artist. After a time he started to be taken seriously, when they saw he was good. 00:15:45 He expanded his knowledge of sound systems by learning and working with his friend QJ, a DJ and sound professional, whom he met through a friend at The East (club). He would go with QJ when he worked sound for shows in Manhattan mostly Latin acts like Eddie Palmieri etc., and also R&B shows. 00:16:46 Mr. Walker talks about the difference between shows on the road and shows in New York City. 00:18:28 After working with the Jimmy Castor Bunch Mr. Walker decided he wanted to be in the studio, so he attended a 6 week recording school to learn about sound engineering. Afterward he went around to studios in Manhattan looking for work and was offered a job at Music Farm sound studio where he earned 75 dollars a week. 00:20:46 At Music Farm, he first swept floors and things like that, but after a while he assisted two studio engineers, he also would sneak people in the studio to record them and practice recording. Then started doing sessions himself, he moved up the ranks quickly because he really knew what he wanted to do. 00:23:25 He worked with Prince as a studio engineer and describes how it was working with Prince in the studio and on the road. 00:28:30 Mr. Walker talks about how he has a �good ear�, and was always around music because his father was an audiophile, and was always listening to his big collection of records. Also Akili was a drummer when he was a kid and by the age of thirteen he was in the musicians union of New York, because he won the battle of the bands. 00:32:25 Mr. Walker talks about when he started to hear about hip hop and the people who he met and worked with. 00:35:42 Mr. Walker discusses his first impression of hip-hop. He talks about hip-hop as simple and not requiring many instruments, there were no drum machines back then, so there would be a live drummer, a bass player, and a keyboard, and that�s it. Hip-hop was simple compared to some of the disco stuff he worked on that had live horn players, or string players, two guitars, two keyboards. Eventually the drum machine came out; DMX was the first hip-hop artist to use that. 00:38:51 Mr. Walker explains why some Artists hated Hip-Hop. 00:40:51 He talks about why studio engineers loved different genres of music and how Larry Smith (a hip-hop producer who ran Rush Grove with Russell Simmons and made records with Kurtis Blow and Run-DMC) from Jamaica, Queens introduced him to hip-hop. He started working with them at Music Farm studio, and then worked with them at other studios around the city. 00:46:04 Akili talks about the growth of the hip-hop, how there were only a few white people at the shows, then you had the Beastie Boys come out, and hip-hop started to get really popular. He started going with hip-hop groups on tours of Europe, which was a culture shock, they didn�t have the same products, they didn�t have your cigarettes, stuff like that, but the people loved the music. 00:48:10 Akili talks about the difference in the music venues in America and Europe, at the time. In Europe the worked in smaller clubs as opposed to arenas in the U.S., also Europe had way less power, so the sound just wasn�t the same. 00:49:50 Akili was not surprised by the success of any of the artists he has worked with. He talks about the difference in Hip-Hop all over America since its first growth in New York, with NWA in California, and hip-hop coming from Nashville, Houston, and Miami too. 00: 53:36 Akili talks about the tensions between East Coast and West Coast hip-hop artists, how everyone from both coasts had a problem with MC hammer back in the day coming from New York, because his beat was so fast. And how hip-hop from all over fused together in the 90�s when Death Row Records started in California. 00:56:00 Akili talks about why hip-hop changed, and how it is not just music - it is a culture. 00:58:24 Akili describes how young people now don�t know who these artists (like Kurtis Blow, or Whodini) are, and aren�t given credit which is definitely due. 01:01:10 Mr. Walker talks about hearing his sounds while on tour, adjusting the microphone and the pressure of having 30,000 people looking at you. 01:03:08 Akili talks about his best experience on tour. [example] �Well I think uh one time I had a story where LL Cool J was on tour, on his own tour, his first solo tour, and um Run-D.M.C. was on tour, and the Beastie Boys and it was decided at one point that both tours would come together in Atlanta, Georgia and do a show. So the lineup was Public Enemy, and Kurtis and Lonnie and LL Cool J from that tour and Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C. from that tour. And LL was so hyped about it because you know because he had just sold out all over the country, you know he was very popular and now he�s going to perform with his idols Run-D.M.C. from the same neighborhood of Hollis, Queens you know. And the first thing he said when he came on stage, he came on stage and said Akili, we gotta get hyped, you know and so I turned up the sound system, which we were using Run-D.M.C.�s sound system. And you know I turned it up louder than they were used to hearing it and the sound company tried turning it down, I kept smacking their hands, telling �em to get outta here and LLs going back and forth and he�s just rocking the crowd and we really uh you know had a good show� 01:09:22 Mr. Walker recalls bad experiences with equipment he�s had while touring, and how it is important to do a sound check before a show. He likes working in both the studio and on tour, when he gets bored of one, he does the other. �I get bored on the road, go back to the studio. I get bored in the studio, go on the road.� 01:11:40 Mr. Walker talks about what it�s like to hear his stuff on the radio (it�s an incredible feeling), and how he loves to hear music in the analog as opposed to the digital, how analog is nice and warm, digital is compressed and can sound flat. 01:14:38 Akili talks about how he loves to go see live music and going out in NYC clubs. 01:17:31 Mr. Walker discusses how he felt hearing his music in the club and the influence of Queens�s musicians in hip-hop.

  "Wandel_Richard_timecode.txt": "Rich was born in 1946 and lived in Ozone Park, Queens from 1947 until 1959, when the family moved to Deer Park, in Suffolk County. His parents grew up in Ozone Park. Rich joined the Seminary for his college years. After being kicked out of the seminary, Rich lived in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, and Spanish Harlem. He moved to Astoria, Queens in 1982 and to East Elmhurst, Queens in 2001, where he lives today. Rich played a leading role the Gay Activist Alliance in the early 1970’s, the premier NYC gay organization at the time. As a volunteer, Rich founded and managed the archives at the LGBT Community Center in Manhattan from 1990 - 2017. For this paying career, Rich served for 17 years as the Associate Archivist for the New York Philharmonic. 00:00:07 This is a Queens Memory interview for Richard Wandel at 32-23 88th Street, East Elmhurst, New York on May 29, 2018 at 12:03 PM. 00:01:15 Rich’s parents were born in Brooklyn. They moved as young children to Queens. His father grew up in Ozone Park, 133rd Avenue between 96th and 97th Street. This was Rich’s childhood home. When his paternal grandparents retired to Florida, his family took over the house. 00:01:42 Rich’s mother grew up in the Gate of Heaven Parish, the next Parish over from his father. This is roughly 104th Street and 101st Avenue. 00:02:02 His father and his mother’s brothers were involved in Boy Scouts Troop 173 out of Gate of Heaven Parish. That is how his parents met. They went to the same high school but met through the Boy Scouts. 00:02:43 During the war years, Rich’s parents lived in Racine, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They moved back to Queens after the war. Rich was born in Milwaukee but has no memory of it as a child. He moved to Queens when he was one-year-old. 00:03:17 There are five siblings. The three oldest were born in Wisconsin and the two youngest were both in Queens. 00:03:31 The family lived at 96-11 133rd Avenue. Ozone Park at that time was mixture of Italian-descent families and an older strain of German-descent families. There were mostly single- family houses, some two- or three-family houses. The houses had a stoop and the kids played stoop ball and box ball. The kids also played stick ball with the sewer covers as bases. 00:04:48 Ozone Park is very close to the Aqueduct Race Track. As kids, Rich and his siblings had to come in early during racing season. The people coming out of the track were crazy drivers, whether they won or lost a race. There was still a small farm in what is now part of the Aqueduct parking lot. 00:05:22 As a child, Rich and his siblings walked a long distance to a playground near John Adams High School (101-01 Rockaway Blvd, Ozone Park, NY 11417). The walk took them past a house with geese, a farm, and junk yards. Rich remembers a horse-drawn wagon ride for kids, a horse-drawn junk man, trucks to sharpen knives, and milkmen delivering milk. (Was in Ozone Park by 1947-48.) 00:06:42 Rich went to Nativity Grammar School and was taught by the Ursiline Order of nuns. The school was located at 94th Street and 101st Avenue (approximate). That was a distance away. Rich took a bus. In fourth or fifth grade he would walk. He would have gone to PS 63 if he had gone to public school. 00:07:08 In 1959, Rich’s family moved to Deer Park in Suffolk County. Rich was 13 years old and in the eighth grade. 00:08:36 Rich then went to St. John’s High School in Brooklyn for one year. This high school is now in Queens. Then he went to St. Anthony’s High School in Smithtown. 00:09:18 Rich is not sure why the family moved. There was a big push at that time (1959) to move to the suburbs. It was not about the schools, because the children were in Catholic schools, and it was not a crime issue. Rich’s mother’s best friend had lived in Hollis and moved to Deer Park first – that might have brought the issue up with his family. 00:10:16 Rich lived in Deer Park through high school years. He then went into the Seminary for college years with the Passionist Order. He moved to various houses within their province - Hartford CT, Pittsburg PA, Springfield MA, Jamaica Estates, Queens, and Union City, NJ. Rich then was kicked out of the Seminary. He came back to his parents’ house, then lived in Manhattan and did a longer stint in Brooklyn (Flatbush). He was not sure, at the time, why he was kicked out of Seminary. They never told him. However, friends who are still in the Order, said it was about being gay, but Rich did not know he was gay at the time. 00:11:58 Rich went from Manhattan to Brooklyn, then to Pennsylvania, then to Spanish Harlem, then to Astoria, and finally to East Elmhurst. 00:12:30 Rich said that when you looked for an apartment, you looked for what was available and what you could afford. At the time, people looked in Brooklyn or Queens, and depending on where you worked, (lower Manhattan vs. mid-town) one or the other made more sense. Rich came to Queens with a roommate (approximately 1982). 00:13:09 Rich was living in Astoria on 21st Street near Broadway. The building (no longer there) was an old wood building, a fire trap and rat infested. The neighborhood was primarily brick apartment buildings. 21st Street was commercial. People were of Greek ancestry with an older strain of Jews. There was a synagogue on Crescent Street. Rich did not like his apartment, but the neighborhood was fine. The theatre was still operating on Broadway (Broadway Theatre?). 00:15:07 Rich then moved to a better place in Astoria - on 34th Street off Broadway. This was a Greek neighborhood. He ate at Uncle George’s, a Greek Tavern, (3319 Broadway) a family-style restaurant on the corner of 34th Street and Broadway. It was inexpensive and good food, with vegetarian options. Rich lived on the fourth floor of a four-story building with no elevator. He lived there mostly by himself but for about three years with a partner. He hung out with other people in the building. (This refers to apartment on 21st Street.) There was not really a gay community there – Rich was involved with the gay community in Manhattan at the time. 00:16:38 In July 2001, Rich moved to East Elmhurst. He bought a co-op. All his friends at the time seemed to be buying co-ops. Rich did not think he could afford it. He decided to investigate buying and the ‘gods led me by the nose step by step’. The day he moved in, his monthly housing costs went up about $5.00. 00:18:24 The neighborhood today is pretty much the same as it was 17 years ago when Rich moved in. It is wonderfully, ethnically mixed. The buildings themselves are mixed. When Rich was younger, there were ethnic sections in Queens but now there is a great deal of ethnic mixture within neighborhoods. This neighborhood is thought of as a Latino neighborhood, but it is in fact more varied. There are a wide variety of Latinos (20-30 countries), Asians, older strain of Jews, Blacks – even within Rich’s building. 00:19:46 There is a major gay community just outside East Elmhurst (in Jackson Heights), but there are gays living in his apartment building. Rich is totally out wherever he is. He may be nervous at times, but that doesn’t stop him. He expects to stay here. 00:20:32 Rich does not own a car – he rents a car once or twice a year. He gets around by walking, busses, and the subway. It is a bit of a walk to the subway station (Jackson Heights) but that is to his advantage – it is healthy to walk there. 00:21:10 Once Rich left the monastery, he lived briefly with his family in Deer Park, then lived in Manhattan and Flatbush. He was 24 years-old at this point (1970). By the standard of that time, it was not so late to come out. He came out to himself while in Manhattan, went into brief tail spin, but soon realized he did not fit the stereotypes. 00:22:14 Rich became involved in gay activism by running into a Gay Activist Alliance (GAA) demonstration (accidentally). He quickly started going to their meetings at the Church of the Holy Apostle’s (296 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001). On a trip home from Union City to Flatbush, he took the bus to Port Authority, walked across Sixth Ave. to the D train, through times Square. When in Times Square, there was a demonstration – jointly sponsored by GAA and the Gay Liberation Front. They were protesting the ‘clean up’ of Times Square – anyone who looked gay was getting arrested (spring of 1970). He joined them. The demonstration began as a picket along 42nd Street (between Times Square and 8th Avenue), then the group decided to walk down to the police precinct conducting the ‘clean up’ (in the 30’s 8th or 9th Avenue). They picketed there, and then marched down to the Village, at 6th Ave and Greenwich Street. 00:25:04 (Might be conflating more than one occasion.) The area off 8th Street between 6th Avenue and University was closed as a pedestrian mall until midnight. The group circled the Women’s House of Detention, then were partying on 8th Street. Midnight comes along, and it was time to open the street again. The police wanted the group to go and a mini-riot ensued. There were provocateurs in the crowd who would throw things at the cops over the crowd and then the cops would beat up the people who looked the smallest. This solidified Rich’s connection with the community. He was scared but not able to leave. (These might be two separate events.) 00:26:18 Rich then became much more involved with GAA. He was working as a photography assistant at Stetch and Stetch – a catalog studio located at Broadway below Bleeker. The shop was visited by District 65 to unionize. Rich got involved in the unionization. He was a supporter, not a leader, but they thought he was a leader and he was fired. Before that they tried to control Rich. The wife of the owner called his mother and told her Rich was gay before he was out. His mother was angry at the owner but now Rich was free to be involved in the GAA. 00:26:55 In the early 1970’s, Rich was an unrepentant hippie, wearing bell bottoms and smoking pot. At the time, there was a strong sense that we were changing the world. There were also Viet Nam demonstrations. Rich had a deferment because he was in the monastery. Rich then discussed his experience applying for Conscientious Objector Status when he left the monastery. He did not receive CO status, but the process stalled things. Rich then discussed the pre-induction physicals. He met someone during this process who was ‘checking the box’, the box for homosexual tendencies. He checked the box. Rich had to see a ‘shrink’ then, but it was the first time Rich was ever happy about bigotry. 00:32:29 Rich could then get more involved in GAA. He was made a Committee Chair, by the first President, Jim Owles. Rich’s two mentors were Arthur Evans and Marty Robinson. Marty was all fire saying the best cure for guilt is anger. Arthur Evans was a thinker and strategist. To be a voting member, you had to attend a certain number of meetings and go to committee meetings. Rich wound up going to an ad-hoc committee related to the Dick Cavett show. There was a guest on the show who had made insulting comments and the GAA did a ‘zap’. Marty was the head of the ad-hoc committee. Rich joined the committee and they met in Marty’s apartment. He gave Rich a job to do. This sucked Rich right into being a part of the organization. There was a lot of sexual activity in the organization, the glue that held the organization together and occasionally the bomb. (Documented in book, Dancing the Gay Lib Blues, by Arthur Bells and Arthur Evans.) There were some monogamous couples but that was not the ethics of the organization. 00:35:55 Rich later became Orientation Committee Chair. To be a member, you had to attend an orientation which was primarily instruction in Robert Rules of Order. This was Arthur Evans’ initiative. The organization was democratic, and the executive committees only had power in an emergency. Everything was voted on the floor at meetings. At this point, there were about 400 people at the meetings. The headquarters were at the old Firehouse at 99 Wooster Street until it burned down 00:37:36 Rich became President of GAA in 1971 and served for one year. At the time, it was the premier gay political organization in NYC. They organized one demonstration in Queens when they were pushing for a gay rights bill at the City Council. Their strategy was to ‘zap’ discriminators. They zapped a Queens apartment building that had discriminatory renting policies. 00:39:08 The unofficial rules with the police were that you would have a sit in but target a more liberal place. They didn’t want the publicity of arrests, so the police didn’t arrest people right away. Then at 5:00 PM, the police give three warnings to leave. The third time, everyone would leave except those willing to get arrested. It was a very effective way to get publicity. The key is to get people to come out of the closet. Rich believes that in terms of race, the courts are ahead of the populace. The opposite is true in gay rights because gays are in every family, and not segregated. Segregation is the key to keeping the status quo. 00:42:42 The trick was to come out and get PR for demonstration. At that point, in the Village, walking hand-in-hand and kissing were political acts. 00:42:52 Rich did not run again for GAA president. Bruce Voeller, who wanted to run, promised that GAA would remain a democratic organization. But his real goal was to form a national board-based organization. This became the National Gay Task Force and later National Gay and Lesbian Task force. Rich was invited to be on the board but had no interest in it. 00:43:56 Rich then became briefly the president of the Mattachine Society. It was in its last days. They did peer counseling, raided dumpsters of grocery stores and mode pots of soup for people who needed it. Rich was friends with Don Goodwin, the previous Mattachine president. 00:44:50 The year Rich was GAA president (1971), they decided to walk to Albany. (About 10 people.) It started in Times Square, took a week, and culminated in statewide collaborative demonstration on the Capitol Steps. The primary motivation was gay liberation but there were secondary motivations as well. For Rich, it was proving he could lead. Sidney Abbott, Ruth Smith, Don Goodwin all helped. 00:47:26 The first night, they were scheduled to sleep in a Quaker Meeting House in Scarsdale. The Quakers and the Unitarians were early supporters. It was pouring rain, and they were outside Mercy College in Westchester waiting to be ferried to the House. They asked permission to get out of the rain, and they said no. They were welcomed by Graymoor Friars. When they were near Poughkeepsie, some Jesus freaks had a barn, but said they would have to pray on it. Then a Methodist Church said they could stay if they participated in panel. The group then stayed in a farm house owned by Kate Millett. They stayed at Pete Seeger’s house in Brewster NY. Outside of Rhinebeck, someone shot at two of the marchers. The state police told them they were lucky it wasn’t the state police shooting, they would not have missed. 00:52:10 The group arrived a day early and stayed overnight in Troy. There were two marches on Albany. There are FBI files on this. Troy Perry was there and spoke. The FBI files said he was the head of a vast national organization. This was very far from the truth. GAA wanted to be grassroots, they did not want to be a top down national organization. 00:53:39 Before Rich was president of GAA, he was the head of the National Gay Movement Committee and they traveled through the mid-west for purposes of organizing. Three people went, Rich, Hernan Figueroa (Rich’s partner at the time), and Jack Hoppen (from Queens). They would meet people at bars and try to pick someone up who could get something started politically. They did that in Pittsburgh. In Cleveland, they worked with Jack Campbell, who later went to Florida and fought Anita Bryant. The group succeeded in being a catalyst for the Gay Activist Alliance in Cleveland. They also worked in Columbus that already had the Society for Individual Rights. They had a picket line at the state Capitol. The idea was to stir things up and an organization was formed from that. 00:57:31 Typically, an organization starts up, falls apart a year later and a more enduring one starts up. This was the same pattern in NYC. All groups were afflicted with internalized homophobia at the time. The Gay Liberation Front (GLF), for example, was so concerned with being part of the left, they lost themselves. At a Black Panther Party convention in Philadelphia, the GLF was treated badly. The women walked out but the men did not. The left was often as bad as the right. 00:59:13 The founders of GAA came out of GLF. They insisted on structure. They would focus on one issue – gay or lesbian - and nothing else. This is not a good idea for our time but was necessary at that time. Many of the members would do other things (Viet Nam protests), but not as GAA members. 01:00:20 Rich was not involved in gay organizing in Queens at this time (1971), he was living in Brooklyn. The Queens organizations that started then were trying to pull in the Queens politicians. QGLU (Queens Gay and Lesbian Union) was an early organization. Rich would know those people, because they were also part of GAA. The Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens started later as the immediate reaction to the killing of Julio Rivera. Danny Dromm did that. 01:01:46 Rich was also briefly involved with the Gay Alliance in Brooklyn, a social group and the first attempt to organize the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) in NY. Hernan Figueroa was Rich’s lover and was an artist. He is Puerto Rican. His teacher called him by the English pronunciation of his name and then he changed it back. Things were not feeling right for Rich any more. He was drinking and decided to leave NYC. 01:04:00 Rich then went to Alfred NY. He had been there a year before with Ruth Simpson, Daughters of Bilitis, to give a talk. It was the first municipality with gay rights law It is a college town. Rich fell in love and moved to Bradford PA where his lover lived. He worked in a sheltered workshop, through a CETA grant, and was there four or five years. Rich talked about various experiences in Bradford. 01:11:14 Rich came back to NY – his lover followed him. They lived in an apartment in Spanish Harlem (99th Street off of Lexington) and then moved together to Astoria (21st Street). Rich was not involved in gay political activities in Queens. He was briefly involved with the Gay Atheist’s League which was a social group but did not work out for him. Rich went back to his love of mythology that had started in high school. He found the Wiccan Circle through an ad in a local Queens paper (Queens Tribune) and he joined. This was Kathexis Coven in Woodside. He was with this Coven for five years and then ‘graduated’ to start his own. With a partner, Rich formed Polyhymnia Coven that still exists today. The head of Kathexis Conven, Michael Thorn, was also the co-founder of the Gay Nurses Association. 01:15:42 Rich knew Danny Dromm before he became a Council Member, through attendance in many meetings. Rich was in the first Queens Pride Parade and has attended each one. He does not attend the Manhattan parade. He will be there next Sunday (June 3, 2018) and will march with the Queens Center for Gay Seniors. He goes to the Center twice a week. 01:17:14 In 1985 (Koch administration), Rich was working on an LGBT exhibit at City Hall with Allen Ellenzwieg, Richard Haymes, and the Mayor’s representative Lee Hudson. In 1989, the LGBT Community Center in Manhattan wanted to create a museum and archives. Richard Burns, then the Executive Director, asked around about who should put this together. Vito Russo, knowing about Rich’s work on the Koch exhibit, asked Rich to do the archives. The initial committee for this was Nancy, AKA Buddy, Seaton, Mark Johnson, Florence Pincus, and Richard Burns. History was always important to Rich. But he realized that although he could learn how to create an archive through reading about it, it would be wiser to have the piece of paper. He decided to go back to school. Rich was working nights at the Bettmann Archive at the time (a photo archive). He went to the NYU Archival Program, receiving a History Masters with a certificate in archival management. That changed his paying career. He served for 17 years as the Associate Archivist for the New York Philharmonic. 01:21:19 Rich then founded the archives at the LGBT Community Center in Manhattan. He left in November 2017 after 27 years. There is now a paid full-time staff, Caitlyn McCarthy. (This was Richard’s goal.) 01:21:57 Rich is now retired from the Philharmonic and the LGBT Community Center archives. He felt he had to do something. He had been a member of the Jackson Heights Arts Club. His initial medium was photography and he was a photo journalist – with photos in the gay papers. One photo taken in 1971 is at the Leslie-Lohman Museum now. About 20 years ago, he migrated to stained glass, then got more into drawing. Rich wanted drawing lessons to help with his stained glass, but now drawing has become a thing in itself. In November 2017, he became president of the organization. It is a 68-year-old organization, non-profit, no hired staff (pay class instructors) and in bad shape financially. The studio is the in basement of a church (St. Mark's Church, 33-50 82nd Street, Jackson Heights, NY 11369.) There are children and adult classes, an annual member show, and ‘on the fence’ an outdoor art show at PS 69 (77-02 37th Avenue, Queens, NY 11372). Artists do demonstrations. Danny Dromm has been very supportive with Council money. 01:25:18 Rich’s father was a studio photographer when he lived in Milwaukee. His favorite model was his wife. When the family moved back to Queens, he became a book keeper/accountant for the Duvenoy Bakery Company in Manhattan. When they folded, he had another job, and did private tax work. His real love was photography. There was always a dark room in the house, starting in Queens. Rich then described the magic of a dark room. 01:27:28 Rich’s first camera was a Kodak box camera. When he was involved in GAA, before being president, he was the principle photographer of all the demonstrations. His photos were published in Gay newspapers in NYC and in the Los Angeles Advocate. 01:28:22 Rich’s father continued to be an amateur photographer, taking pictures of the family and other things that interested him. When he died, he left the photos to Rich as the archivist. Rich donated them to the Queens Library Long Island Collection. These are pictures of Queens life, including wedding pictures at Gate of Heaven Church and major snow storms. 01:29:21 This is a very difficult time with ‘Mr. 45’. There is an enabling of people to come out of their hate-filled closet and attack people. Queens is relatively ok, but not totally – there have been attacks on trans people. Rich noticed that hanging out with the non-activist gay community at the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, there is prejudice within the gay community with regard to trans people and to a lesser extent, racial identities (although that is not particularly noticeable because of large immigrant community.) There a great need to move that forward by coming out and objecting to racist, sexist jokes, etc. Rich has always been out and spoken out. 01:33:03 Rich continues to speak out as a gay rights activist. Even in the Jackson Heights Art Club, the gay members, while not hiding, have a certain delicacy by not saying anything. These are generally older people. Rich hopes we will survive this, but a lot of people will be hurt in the process. He hopes that we come out ahead as these bigots were not created by Trump but have now been brought to light. Rich had no idea of the extent of this hatred. He is much more aware of that reality. That is a good thing. Rich is an optimist. Progress and justice are not a straight line, you go back in forth but in toto, hopefully, we move slightly forward. 01:37:52 Rich thinks NYC has quite good funding senior services - within walking distance there are lots of places for a good senior lunch. There are still difficulties when someone is gets ill. This is compounded for an LGBT person, often isolated from their family. If Rich gets to that point, his hope is with his chosen family. People say the people at the gay senior centers are the most lively, aware and active! 01:40:47 Rich thinks Queens is a great place. Even if he could afford it, he would not move to Manhattan. He likes the ethnic mixture within one neighborhood and the space. Queens has also produced great people i.e. Eddie Buczynski, a gay man, grew up in Ozone Park (as did Jack Kerouac) and was the founder of the Minoan tradition of Wicca. In the 1970’s, WICCA was prejudiced, and Eddie found this own tradition (documented in Bull of Heaven by Michael Lloyd). 01:43:10 Rich still thinks in terms of parish. Queens library has been very important to Rich, since he was a kid. When living on 133rd Avenue, Rich and his sister walked to the library at 101st Ave. It was a grand building - the storefront across was the children’s library. Rich’s family always encouraged reading and music. 01:41:05 Rich’s mother had a back ground in music. His mother and father were involved in a Gilbert and Sullivan troupe in Queens. His mother sang, and his father was the business manager and photographer. Rich’s mother believed that there had to be books and music in the house. At dinner, if there was dispute about a fact, the family looked at the encyclopedia. In the basement, there were at least 1,000 books that the family had accumulated. Rich was involved in scouting in Queens. He went to Scout Camp with the Queens Council (land on Long Island). Queens was a good place to be raised. He is more than happy to be back home. Rich is still a member of the Queens Library. He is also a member of the New York Public Library, but prefers the Queens library, as they are more likely to have the books he wants to read. 01:47:39 End of the Queens Memory interview with Richard Wandel at 32-23 88th Street, East Elmhurst, New York on May 29, 2018 at 1:50 PM.

She grew up in a household that cultivated a strong musical environment. Groups of musicians would play at her house on Sundays. Vivian was always interested in the percussion instruments. 00:15:49 Vivian Warfield recalls a Pepsi commercial with a soundtrack that was recorded in New York City. Her teacher Ivo Araujo assisted her in getting involved the commercial. 00:17:02 Vivian Warfield’s first job was working for the Queens Public Library as a library page re-shelving books. She recalls the branch being located not far from the Van Wyck Expressway. 00:18:15 Instead of going back home during college break, Vivian Warfield stayed in Boston and became a counselor with a summer camp program in Roxbury. Roxbury is Boston’s well-known African American neighborhood. 00:19:09 Vivian talks about the major tragedies that affected her while she was attending Boston University.

  "Weaver_Gladys_timecode.txt": "Gladys Weaver was born in Saluda, South Carolina. When she was still very young, her parents decided to relocate the family to New York City. They first lived in Manhattan but did not enjoy the crowded apartment living conditions. The family soon moved to Jamaica, Queens, where they were able to live in a house with a backyard and driveway. Gladys thoroughly enjoyed her early life in Jamaica. Neighbors were all well acquainted and treated each other like family. She attended P.S 40 elementary school, Jamaica Vocational High School and also took a course in Business Administration at Royal Business School in Manhattan. She married her husband in 1947 and despite learning from the doctors that she could not conceive, gave birth to a son in 1951. Religion has always been a core component of Gladys�s life. She took a General Bible course at Tabernacle Bible Institute and also earned a master�s degree in theology & religious education at United Christian College. In the course of her religious education, she has been licensed as a missionary, ordained as a minister and has also been a church elder. As Gladys lived through these experiences, Jamaica progressively changed. The neighborhood�s transformation began during the 1950s when the government actively encouraged whites to move out and settled blacks into the neighborhood. Today, Gladys laments that much of Jamaica�s cohesion and community-feel have now eroded. Present day Jamaica is drastically different from the predominantly Italian American community of the 1940s. This interview has two breaks in which the interviewers turned off the recorder to take a break. The first is at 00:13:53 and the second break is at 00:22:32. 00:01:09 Parents chose to live in Jamaica, Queens. Parents moved out in Queens when she was very young (moved to Queens in 1937 from Manhattan; lived on 108th Ave, between 170 and 171st streets). She has never moved from Jamaica since. 00:02:25 Parents originally came from South Carolina. Moved to Manhattan but were unused to living in crowded conditions. (Did not like living in an apartment). Parents wanted to live in a private, detached house with a backyard and driveway. They moved to Queens. 00:03:49 Parents moved to 104th Road, where they purchased a home. Gladys got married in 1947 and moved from her parents� house to a co-op at 109th Ave. (exact address: 109-34 172nd St. Jamaica, NY 11433). She has been living in the co-op since 1952. 00:04:30 Enjoyed living in the co-op because it was quiet. She remembers that everyone in Jamaica knew each other and treated each other like family. 00:05:04 Families in Jamaica would always provide shelter/take in wanderers. The neighborhood was very safe; gun violence was unheard of. 00:06:16 Attended a Baptist church on South Road and Railroad Ave. A housing project was built over Railroad Ave. 00:07:05 Jamaica used to be home to Italian, Jewish and Polish Americans. There were a lot of storefronts and also some bars, which were called �beer gardens.� 00:07:58 Worked in Long Island City at Silver Cup Bakery. Shift was from 4-12. People did not have to be too vigilant against potential criminals. She does not understand how the neighborhood has changed so rapidly. 00:09:30 There were bakeries, dressmakers, lawyer�s offices, tailors and beautiful storefronts on the streets. 00:10:25 Remembers mom and pop stores on New York Blvd. Also remembers Jewish stores. Storeowners knew every child in the neighborhood. She misses the family like cohesion amongst Jamaica residents during the 1940s. 00:11:08 Parents probably moved to Jamaica because the lifestyle of the neighborhood was similar to that of their original home in South Carolina. 00:11:47 There was always a truck with fresh produce that came 2-3 times a week. People bought fish from a fish man and baked goods from a bread man. The milk man delivered milk on people�s front stoop. 00:13:18 She misses how life was like in the past. 00:14:39 The neighborhood began to change after the Second World War and then began to change drastically during 1949-1950. At the end of World War 2, government built public housing projects in Jamaica. 00:15:40 People who originally lived in the Bronx or Harlem were relocated to the public housing projects in Jamaica. 00:16:08 Schools were mostly Italian with some Jews. There were very few Chinese; they worked mostly as launderers. 00:16:52 There used to be an Italian Feast celebration every year in Jamaica (a testament to the highly established Italian community in the neighborhood). 00:17:25 Played and socialized with Italians. 00:17:43 City bought up homes belonging to Italians. Government agents would stick notices on people�s door, forewarning people that the neighborhood demographic is becoming increasingly black. The government offered to buy houses from the Italians. The Italians and other whites were basically convinced to move out of the neighborhood. 00:19:09 Many black people came to Jamaica to buy their first houses. However, they could not keep up with the costs and often faced foreclosure. Black people also did not realize that the house they bought was often not worth the cost (they were overcharged). 00:21:50 Sent her son to the same elementary school (P.S. 116) as her sister and youngest brother. She was shocked at how drastically the school (demographic) had changed. 00:22:54 Got married in her parents� home at 164-12 104th Road in Jamaica, NY. Met her husband on Easter Sunday coming home from church. He did not make a good first impression on her. She lied and told him she was married because she was on her way to a dance in Manhattan with her cousin and didn�t want him to join them. 00:24:15 As time went by, she began to notice her future husband�s good qualities. She admired his church values, family values and moral values. 00:24:50 Doctors told her that she would never have a child. 00:26:02 Prayed for a child. She became pregnant within 3 months. 00:26:55 She was married in her home (a house ceremony). A limousine took them (she and her husband) to a ceremony at Eddie�s Palm Garden on Merrick Road 00:27:50 Husband has passed away and son moved to Maryland. 00:29:31 Before her husband met her, he served in Armed forces. He was wounded badly in combat. Since he was a veteran, they were easily able to obtain an apartment. He was able to choose a residence from the apartment blueprint. 00:31:00 Only married families could live in the apartments. 00:31:27 Husband was originally from Johnston, South Carolina. He came from Johnston to live with her cousins. She became acquainted with him through her family. 00:32:13 Memories of childhood in South Carolina are not very clear. She remembers attending a school in her natal city of Saluda. Following her son�s birth, she toured South Carolina and became more familiar with the state. 00:32:39 The teachers in South Carolina liked/favored her sister. She basically remembers going to church and school. 00:33:02 Hated New York. She went on an elevator for the first time in New York. She did not enjoy living in a crowded apartment. 00:35:25 When her family moved to Jamaica, the neighborhood was still not serviced by the subway. People had to take the Q60 bus from Forest Hills 71st Continental station. Then, to get to Jamaica Ave, people had to take a trolley. There was no F line, only the E line. 00:36:22 Eventually they extended the subway to Jamaica. People paid a nickel for the bus and a nickel for the subway; it cost a dime to commute to Manhattan. 00:37:30 Her first saving account was at the post office (postal savings account). Post office gave her a deposit book. Every time she made a deposit, she would receive a certification stamp on her deposit book. 00:40:40 There were open fields everywhere and a lot of space for kids to run. 00:41:22 Bus terminal used to be on New York Boulevard, before it was relocated to its current location in Jamaica.

  "Weber_Robert_timecode.txt": "00:00:23 Robert Weber’s family lived in an attached two family house that was built in the 1930s. His house was very conveniently located to Robert’s school and place of work. Mr. Weber doesn’t have any special connections with his neighbors and he finds his communication with them very limited. His neighborhood consists of people from many different ethnic groups. There haven’t been any significant changes in his neighborhood over time, although he notes that the numbers of shops in the area have increased. 00:07:06 Robert’s uses cars, bikes, motorcycles, buses and trains to get around places. He works in Crown Heights. During his free time he skies, rides his bike, plays paddle ball, and swims. 00:08:15 Trains and buses are common sources of transportation in the neighborhood. 00:09:11 Some qualities that this neighborhood has that would be useful in other parts of New York are the low crime rate, the diversity, etc. 00:09:48 Ozone Park is bordered by parkways, boulevards, cemeteries, and large bodies of water. There are limited facilities for worship in the area. Some of the qualities that make the area unique are the nearness of beaches, casinos, horse track, golf courses, and parks.

  "Weingart_Ellen-et-al_timecode.txt": "Ellen Weingart, Edith Balan, and Linda Tucker, all Queens College alumnae, recount their time at Queens College in the 1960’s. They all grew up nearby and attended Queens College because at the time it was free and very prestigious. They spoke about their experiences in housing plans and with social activities, as well as the rigorous academics. Ellen went into education, taught for a while, but finally settled into education administration. Linda went on to become a published author and an editor-in-chief for many magazines and newspapers. Edie also went into teaching after graduation but switched tracks after returning from maternity leave. Edie eventually settled into museum administrative work which entailed a lot of docent work and organizing education material. All three women remained friends throughout the years and now live in Long Island. 00:01:00* Jaqueline asks why the interviewees decided to go to Queens College. Ellen went to Queens College because it was close to home, had a good rep, and seemed like a good fit. Linda agrees, Queens College was close to home and most importantly it was free. Good reputation attracted many. Edith, daughter of immigrants (father was a postal worker), first gen college student also chose Queens College because it was close to home and free. Edie’s family lived across the street in Pomonok. Hunter was too far. 00:02:41* Ellen mentions that at the time that she graduated high school in 1956 that Queens College was considered the top of the colleges in New York City. Not easy to get into and it was very prestigious. You had to have a 90 and above average to get into Queens College, but if you didn’t have that average you can take an exam and it would place you depending on your score. You’d be able to place out of certain classes depending on your score. 00:04:43* Jaqueline asks how the three women met each other. Linda and Ellen are cousins. Edith met Ellen when she got married and moved to Woodbury. Edith’s husband had mutual friends through work w Ellen’s husband, they met at the tennis courts at Syosset Park . They’ve been friends for almost 50 years. Edith and Linda met through Ellen. Turns out that Edith and Linda actually graduated from Queens College the same year. 00:05:35 Jaqueline asks what were their favorite classes. Ellen says English, Linda says English, and Edith liked History. Jaqueline asks about the housing plans at Queens College. Ellen says that she joined the Rainbow House and mentions that housing was a social place and a lot of people used it for dating. Ellen wanted to start a housing plan for people that were already in relationships with someone, named it “attached” plan but it didn’t pan out. 00:07:40 Ellen started making friends who were joining “rainbow” house and so that’s how she joined in. They had a lot of activities especially for girls that were already in relationships or engaged and so they had “drag” parties where you would “drag” your partner. Not your usual, what are now called “drag” parties where folks would dress up “in opposite gender” clothing. There were other “stag” parties for people that weren’t in relationships. Rainbow house was really social, they went to the theater in the city and had beach parties. Everyone was considered really young to be engaged, but it was part of the culture and the newspaper “the Phoenix” would publish lists based on houses of people that were engaged. 00:11:03* Many of the women got married early, Ellen married before graduating Queens College. Linda came on campus in 1958 and joined the Rainbow house mainly because of Ellen. Linda was more involved in a magazine called “Spectrum”, the literary magazine for Queens, where she was the editor-in-chief. Through the magazine Linda was nominated to “Who’s Who Among Students” (a national college student recognition program in the US that’s been compiling it’s list since 1934). 00:12:39 Edie belonged to Hilltop House and it was also very social. Edie doesn’t recall being very involved or doing social projects. Edie talks about her friend, who had also gone to Queens College, who mentioned that all the men at those parties were so short. 00:14:04* Jaqueline asks what their best memory of attending Queens College was. Ellen says that in hindsight her best memory was the quality of the education which she didn’t realize at the time. She noticed that when she went to graduate school (for a business administration degree) she was ahead of her peers because of how Queens College had prepared her. While being at Queens College, though, Ellen says it was hard and she was just too busy to take a lot in. Edie adds on that when she graduated Queens College as a speech educator she had to present a speech, was questioned by faculty, had to take a national exam, and every time anyone finished a core program (like contemporary civilization) in addition to the courses and the papers, there were more examinations. Edie mentions that by the time she graduated, she didn’t want to see another book. This is all to say that she felt she was well prepared at Queens College, almost felt like she had done a Master’s Degree by the time she graduated. Though, Edie points out that some classes were lacking. Overall they think it was a good school and it taught you to be disciplined and focused. 00:17:43 Linda chimes in and reiterates that it was the quality of education at Queens College. She loved it and her time at Queens College might’ve been some of the best years of her life. She took so many different classes and points out art, philosophy, history, aesthetics, music, all of those classes contributed to her background in knowledge. She took one class specifically in Anthropology where she became close with the professor Mariam Slater. Linda went to her house many times, Mariam would go to Linda’s sons concerts. This professor just really opened up a whole new door for Linda. 00:19: 31 All three women question whether students nowadays get the same level of education. Ellen says that she knows for a fact that students aren’t getting the same education because her daughter is 50 years old and also went to college and she didn’t have to take the core classes the way they did. Also that her daughter was the only one in her class that knew the capital of all the states. 00:20:42 Jaqueline says that she’s asked all her questions and that the women should take the interview from here and talk about whatever they want to. Edie says she was too busy studying. Linda points out that back in the day there were two cafeterias; the big caf and the little caf. In the big caf there were sororities, fraternities, houses. In the little caf were the philosophy majors, writing majors, sociology majors—they decided they were different from the majority. Linda would always go to the little caf and didn’t really associate with people that were mainly in the big caf. Linda asks if it’s the same way now and Jaqueline says that it’s all one caf now, but also that there are many more choices including food trucks. 00:22:39 Ellen points out that she didn’t know at the beginning what she wanted to study when she started Queens College. She signed up for vocational guidance service that allowed her to take an exam (Cooter Vocational Preference Exam) but it didn’t clarify anything for her. Ellen ended up being an education major, but realized she didn’t like teaching. She got a job teaching for NYC, but didn’t like it and went on a 14 year maternity leave, 4 years with each child. Later on she got a job at a school district coordinating volunteers and realized she like the administrative side. Went for a Master’s degree in Business Administration and ended up with a totally different career and never went back to the classroom, became an administrator. 00:25:00 Edie chimes in that she had a different path. She graduated as a speech education major and student taught at Bryant High School in Astoria. Was 17 years old student teaching, as old as the seniors at the school. Edie didn’t feel comfortable teaching high school and so she got more education credits and went on to teach elementary education for 7 years. After her maternity leave she wanted to go back into teaching, but there were no job openings in Long Island because of budget restraints. Edie didn’t want to go back to the City to teach so she had to reinvent herself. Edie ended up working for the Nassau County museum system in their museum education department. Did a lot of docent work and organizing educational material. Edie feels like her experience at Queens College helped her do that and her skills were easily transferred. 00:27:10* All three women agree that the professors at Queens College were excellent. Even the professors they disliked were good. They say that Queens College being a Liberal Arts school really helped them out a lot. 00:27:34 Linda is a published author. She went into Queens College to be a writer and came out a writer. Linda says she learned a lot about the world around her at Queens College. Linda feels like nowadays people only see college as a way to get a job. She warns her grandchildren that it’s not all about that, that they should enjoy college more and learn about a lot more. Linda thinks the youth today need a broader education. 00:29:35* Edie chimes in saying that when they went to school the opportunities were a lot more limited. Most women became a nurse, a teacher, and very few that went on to become attorneys and physicians. For the most part women went on to get married, have children. Edie claims that it was them three that started the wave of going back to work after having children, but that’s not the case today. Edie does think that nowadays since everything is computerized and digital it’s important that students study useful material and major in something that will get them those jobs. 00:31:36* Linda has a novel that’s available on the kindle and has various short stories and book reviews. She’s written for newspapers and magazines, and most recently is doing freelance work. 00:32:17 Ellen donated some memorabilia to Queens College. A rainbow house pin that people back in the day would use it as a way to identify that they were part of rainbow house. Ellen was also interviewed by the Queens College alumni magazine. Ellen explains what “pinning” was—if a boy belonged to a fraternity he would “pin” you as a pre-engagement sign (after going steady, but before getting engaged). He would later go on to become Ellen’s husband. He went to Brooklyn Poly-Technic Institute and belonged to a fraternity. Ellen wore his frat pin over her left breast. When they got engaged, Ellen stopped wearing the pin. Now has saved both her husband’s pin and her own house pin. Ellen also donated a copy of the newspaper that her house put out called the Rainbow Review from September 1958. Ellen remembers that they put out several issues. The contents were articles by the president and members of the house, about activities like a beach party. 00:36:38* Ellen also points out there was an article about a theater party and that it was illustrated by one of their members. Ellen would also write up crossword puzzles. Ellen also sent in a program of a dance festival from May 1958 – called the “Canaveral Capers”. The festival was dedicated to the successful rocket launches that were made by the U.S. The U.S. was behind Russia in rocket launches. Rainbow house put together a folk dance and Ellen was one of the members (12 all together) who danced. The women all get excited about their time folk dancing. Remember that they had to take 4 semesters of physical education. Tennis, golf, lacrosse, swimming, etc. 00:36:38* Edie points out that Queens College didn’t have a golf course so the students would have to go to Kissena Park. Ellen also donated a program for a March 1958 production of Romeo and Juliet presented by the Queens College Theater as part of the Department of Speech. Ellen googled Gerald Rinestein, a classmate that’d played Romeo, and found out that he’s still acting. 00:43:20 Women talking about all the memorabilia they saved from when they were younger like essays and papers, awards, fire prevention certificate, poetry contest winning certificate, report cards. 00:44:41* Ellen mentions that her sister, 9.5 years older than her, won in 1939 the fire prevention memo for writing the fire prevention essay and it was presented to her in the 1939 world’s fair. She has a medal. Linda mentions that she had a lot of those fire prevention medals, a whole stack. Linda says that’s when she realized she was meant to write. 00:46:02 The women start wrapping up and talk about where the interview will be posted. ",

  "Westervelt_Liivia_timecode.txt": "“I think they chose it by accident. It must have sounded like a lovely name.” Having escaped the Soviet occupation in Estonia, Liivia Westervelt immigrated to America via Germany and Czechoslovakia as an eight-year-old. After a short stint in Port Washington and in the Bronx, her parents bought a house in Sunnyside Gardens. “I think they chose it by accident,” the 69-year-old laughs. “It must have sounded like a lovely name.” For Liivia, the lovely name lived up to its promises. While she was only one of two immigrant children at P.S. 150, she remembers her neighbors as “very accepting.” Sure, it was hard at first—she didn’t speak any English, and some of her schoolmates made fun of her name, calling her Libby’s Orange Juice and Liverball Soup—but since her parents had instilled her with a strong sense of dignity, she quickly made friends. She played hopscotch and roller-skated down 45th Street, where, with some interruptions, she has lived to this day. In the 1950s the streets of Sunnyside Gardens were so void of parked cars and traffic that people were accustomed to burning stacks of fall leaves in the middle of the street. After Liivia married, she and her husband found a house coincidentally also on 45th Street. Liivia had two children in Sunnyside. This was also where she had her first Chinese food, her first Pizza and her first kiss. In Sunnyside she organized neighborhood protests against the Vietnam War and fought for women’s and civil rights and for the landmarking of Sunnyside Gardens. Not surprisingly, it was a neighbor who suggested she pursue a master’s degree in social work, steering her toward what she calls “the passion in my life.” Even after Liivia divorced and moved to Bayside, she continued to come to 45th Street several times a week to take care of her aging mother and to spend time with her friends, some of whom she knew since childhood. When her mother died in 2003, Liivia moved back into the house where she had spent her teenage years. “I meet some of the older people here that remember me since I was 10 or 15,” she says. “It’s great to have this continuity.” Liivia now tries to pass on this sense of continuity and community to her grandchildren, who often come to visit from Ohio and Florida. The kids quickly connected with other kids on the block who now visit them in Florida in the summer. Liivia enjoys introducing her grandchildren to the ethnic restaurants in the neighborhood and watching them play in her spacious courtyard. “Sunnyside,” she says, “has been a very big part of my life.” ",
  "Wheeler_Edjo_timecode.txt": "[00:00:01] Hi my name is Abdulaziz albarshaa. I will interview with Mr. Edjo Wheeler today is October 27th Location is Plaxall Gallery. Long Island City New York. Hi how are you Mr. Edjo. First of all, can you interduce yourself please. [00:00:20] Yes. First of all, I just want to say thank you guys for doing this. I think it's a fantastic project that you guys have taken on. I think it's really cool. My name is Edward Joseph Wheeler, everyone calls me Edjo. I am the artistic director of the Plaxall gallery and on the board of directors for Long Island City Artists. [00:00:43] Aziz: what is your earliest memory of wanting to be an artist? [00:00:55] Mr. Edjo: My mother was an artist, so I actually don't remember a time where I didn't think I was going to be an artist of some kind. What kind of art that is had changed over time thought I might want to be an illustrator I might want to be an actor, but it was always a part of my life. [00:01:22] Aziz: what do you like about your work? [00:01:29] Mr. Edjo: I think it depends on when you ask me because sometimes the hardest things about the work don't pay off until later you know so I don't know. I think actually maybe that is it. That's one of the best things about my work is its hard work that pays off. There's no instant gratification in anything we do. Not that there's anything wrong with that but what we're doing here is we're building something long term and that goes from my personal art as well. None of my work is fast It's all I don't want to say laborious but it's it takes a lot of effort to manipulate the metal in the welding and the grinding and it takes a really long-time and, but I think the payoffs are much higher in the level of fulfillment. After I look at the piece if I know my blood sweat and tears aren't in it and that translates into the other part of my work which is running artistic spaces. It takes a long time to build these things up. I've never walked into an organization that already had their act together or they probably would be working with me in the first place you know so running the space attracting the talent letting the really good talent know you're worth their time and energy is a big part of it and building your audience and getting to a point where it's self-sustainable and profitable that's really hard but there is nothing better you know that's the best part of the work. [00:03:29] Aziz: how were the arts and the past? [00:03:36] Mr. Edjo: How were the arts and the past. How were my arts in the past? I guess I'm not certain what the question means you mean like historically art �... Well for me it was again depending on which art I was pursuing at the time when I was younger, I had no idea how to even get close to making it a career. I mean I thought I would have thought that someone would just realize my brilliance. Like only God can write and then I realized I wasn't as brilliant as I've thought it was a lot more competitive than I thought. I think probably the main differences when I was young there was no Internet and you had no way of even finding out who the gallery director was or who is producing work in your area. Like what are you going to do flip through the phone pages you had to go to all the art openings you had to like you had to network that was the only way to find out what was going on. Now you can just look it up online so the access to art has increased tremendously but I also feel like that allows anyone to call themselves an artist and I think that the drink gets diluted after a while you know so like we're inundated with these things we're in inundated with art and artists when we can find out find out whoever is doing what like the world is at your fingertips. Just like everything else but in the art world it was something that really wasn't accessible before and now it is, and I think that leaves it vulnerable to becoming commercialized which it has. [00:06:11] Aziz: when did you start working with the Plaxall Gallery? [00:06:18] Mr. Edjo: Well we first started working with the Plaxall Gallery when our arts organization Long Island City Artists was looking for a new home. Now they used to be in the paper factory and that was like eight years ago and they lost the space the building came down replaced which I'm sure we're going to talk about later. The gentrification of the neighborhoods they lost their space. This organization has been around since 1986. Long Island City Artists and they've been looking for a space for a long time so, when I joined the board three and a half years ago one of the first things, we started to do was look up for look around for pop up spaces. In other words, some building owner has a storefront that he's trying to rent so it's empty it's vacant well let us move and there's a very old idea yeah we definitely didn't invent this but we definitely wanted to take advantage of the idea so, we'll say hey we'll turn your space into an art gallery we'll paint the walls white hang art we'll have art openings you can invite your friends leave a name. The temporary gallery after your grandchildren or your grandpa or whatever right and we started to contact business owners and whatnot and Carol Crawford our president of the organization and Steve Cooper our advisory board and lawyer both knew the people who ran the business Plax saw it as a plastics manufacturing and shaping company like their grandfather sort of invented heat vacuum sealant forming plastic you know to like hold an object you know so, they had a successful business. So, they started to buy property. So now they own this block that the galleries on the block across the street another building also. We approached them and said hey you know do you have any space. And they said after about six months of sort of gently nudging them every once in a while, hey remember us just wondering if you had any space. I mean looking back now that I know these people. Everyone asks them for that. I mean it is amazing that we got this space because I mean I'll be hanging out with them at a party and people are coming up to them so, you know we have a Christmas party we wanted to rent out a space or do you have any artist like I mean like it is incessant so, I think the organizations are like those Oregon history reputation may have played a part in us getting their attention because they turned over a thousand square feet to us which was amazing we got a phone call from them and they said here's the space you have that for two months don't get comfortable and it was a print shop and the print shop didn't move out until November 5th no15th. We had an opening scheduled sometime in November and they didn't get out until two weeks before we opened so, in two weeks we had to paint the place we had to hang lights because the old company that was in there took every single lighting fixture with them so, we're in an eight thousand square foot gallery 24 foot high ceilings and there's no lights so, I had to go to Home Depot. We bought all the scoop lights and all those hoop lights we bought all the scoop lights that they had we put we created these two by four beams to clamp the lights onto ran wires all over the place really of some scary electrical work we all fix that now but, in the beginning, it was just about getting it done because we only had the space for like two months a month and a half and we squeezed two exhibitions into that time and now they just keep extending it. Now we've been here for exactly two years right because today's October 27 actually and we they let us know. I think on October 27 that we had the space for November and December so, yeah October 2016. [00:10:42] Aziz: how do you work as a manager in a Plaxall Gallery and approach your subject? [00:10:53] Mr. Edjo: Well there's the manager of people and then there's the manager of the art. Those are two those are two separate things. Exactly, you know so you approach your subject if that means more of an artistic in an artistic enough to squeeze an artistic way. Well as a manager as the director of the artistic director I can't just do what I like. I have to do what I think is right for the organization and that will be best for the gallery. I have to take those things into consideration first so, making sure you don't stack up the same kind of show two times in a row you know making sure that you don't have exhibitions that clash like you don't want to put a halloween show next to a domestic violence show right you don't want those in the building at the same time because we basically have three different exhibition spaces you know those shows should not be put in together and you might make someone angry by saying what you mean you don't want to put my show in lights you have to explain to them that you know there are bigger ideas that need to be protected. Right so, first my approach my approach to choosing our subjects is first what is good. Our motto is stolen from what's the author's name. Michael Kaiser an art of the turnaround good art. Well marketed so that's what we're interested in we want to show the best art we possibly can and we want to market it well so that everyone can succeed so, another part of that is both diversity and specificity so, we want to bring in as many new people as possible we want to have as broad a reach as possible. But at the same time, we're still serving a very specific community so, we have to have our member shows and whatnot so not everyone agrees with the tactics we're employing here at the gallery like we get some criticism for letting an outside curators and outside groups opening up the gallery which is run by a local organization to many outsiders and I have very strong feelings about that. I really feel that if you do not let in people from the outside, you're never going to learn your network is never going to grow. It's just not healthy. The only way the organization in the gallery is going to remain healthy and prosperous is if we are bringing in people from outside the neighborhood attract national artists make this a place where everyone is welcome we're still our main focus is still going to be our members it's still going to be western Queens for sure but only through diversity are we going to be able to survive now the next step of that we got even more criticism for which is letting in the performing arts because before we were only painting painters� photographers sculptors ceramics you know. But now dancers actors musicians they're all allowed to join the organization now that had to go to the board for a vote and the board voted the right way you know they said yes not everyone you know but most of them said yes let's do this so, now what happens is we get to draw from those communities we get to draw from those cultures we get to draw from those networks so, we just had an event here for the Institute for Public Architecture IPA and I like why are we doing that. Why are we giving them this space? Because are architects that is another form of art, we want that represented let them join us and what happened they had a big event here and we sold two paintings from the people who showed up from the IPA. Now that is there is no better proof than we should be opening up to outsiders we should open it up to outside events you know this is a place where everyone should be welcome. All the arts happen here. That's a slogan that I'm trying to pick up for us the arts happen here it doesn't it doesn't matter what kind so, but it also means the other part of that management means that you sometimes you have to say no to things and it's really hard because it's a tight community and sometimes people are they want to do something in the gallery and you don't think it's best for the gallery you don't think it might not be best for the organization so you'd have to say no and that that's really hard you know when you know someone and their artwork might be great or you might not think their artwork is great and you don't want to give them a solo show but they kind of expect one because they know you. So that's a little hard that part that parts a little hard so yeah. [00:16:47] Aziz: what are the biggest challenges you are facing when starting in your job? [00:16:55] Mr. Edjo: The biggest challenge in all honesty and I'm hesitant to say this the biggest challenge is convincing people that the plan that we have is a good one and to trust in what we are planning. You have a vision for how the space should work and you're coming to this with a couple of decades of experience. You know this is not as they say my first rodeo. Right. And you can see the path so clearly and when people say to you. Why do we have to share this space with the performing arts you�re like fine. I can't believe you don't know why. The reason is because it is healthy for the organization. The reason why is because we should be promoting all arts and the main idea that I tried to sell that some people get right away but they don't understand the work that's involved sometimes and that is to all right. I can say it this way. Who goes to dance concerts. Other dancers you know who goes to poetry jams other poets you know and their family you know who goes to theater shows and I'm not saying these arts don't have massive followings. I'm not saying that these I do not mean this in a derogatory fashion to any of the arts. I mean it across the board for all arts and that is the people who are into that art form tend to be into that art form and then smaller is a smaller percent of people are into a secondary type of art and then there's a broad spectrum of the population that are into everything just a little bit but that also doesn't mean that there couldn't go out of their way to support these things. Right so if you're a poet how can you broaden your network. We�ll have your poetry jam at our art opening so the people who love painting and poetry a little bit get you experience in poetry the poets the people who follow the poets are now in this great art gallery and they get to see that we do live theatrical performances and one of them is an actor so then that poet then auditions for a play here and gets cast you know so like now we're creating this integrated network an emphasis on the net and emphasis on the work right so, all the artists are connected and we can together be so much stronger than any one thread right so we can catch so much more that way you know but not everyone has to get back to your question eventually. Not everyone feels that way and it's surprising to me that some of the people who still criticize our decisions to do this come to these events and there's like 200 people in the gallery 200 people that never would have been here if it wasn't for that other than the live music concert. The you know the puppet show you know they never would have been anywhere or giving the space over to the PTA. Hundreds of people thousands of people pass through this gallery in London related events to the fine arts. You know that's good for us. But then people don't want us to do it want us to focus too much on the fine art so, that�s hard make that convincing people of your vision. Long story short convincing people of your vision is probably the hardest part. The second hardest part is you know I was going to say raising money. But we've been doing pretty good right now like we're getting by and when we actually when we actually start to focus on fundraising, I think we're going to kill it. The last thing the third thing that is probably the hardest is finding the right people to join your team. You need that person that would rather die than see the project not get finished. You need the kind of person who's willing to stay here till 2 o'clock in the morning and if they can't stay till 2:00 o'clock in the morning then they have some other way of really being dedicated and understanding the needs of what you're doing and having that person be stable. Right so if you can find those team members then you can build something without those other team members if you just have a few violent a few dedicated volunteers or some a couple of people who are getting paid or even a lot of people getting paid. What we are doing cannot succeed without the handful of truly dedicated people that really want this to happen and those are the people who are willing to work for free and even if you are paying them, they work twice as long twice as hard you know, and you need to protect those people you need to make sure that they don't get burned out you need to make sure that people aren't asking too much of them because they're the they are the yes people if you want something done ask a busy person you know that expression right because that's the type of personality that's going to do it so, as a manager you need to be able to protect those people so, that they don't burn out and they can continue to do really good work. [00:23:21] Aziz: are artists affected by the economic crisis in 2008? [00:23:33] Mr. Edjo: the economic crisis in 2008 definitely affected everyone. It also created some opportunities and I think in 2008 a lot of areas became more affordable for people. Right you can't charge as much for rent you know some rentals and some spaces became available to artists because they became vacant and they needed to fill them with something. But in 2008 Long Island City was already getting expensive right. They had learned that the developers the business minded people have learned that follow the artists right. So in a little bit of my experience when I first moved here almost 20 years ago I was probably working for one of the last independent art galleries in Soho and that landlord wanted her out so bad but then all the all the artists moved to Williamsburg bush wick Dumbo you know and all those places got expensive so the second they got the whiff that it was going to be long island city next. Everything got expensive right off the bat. So even as early as 2008 long island city was already becoming unaffordable it was already getting expensive. So, I don't actually know how to answer that question except for it was inevitable. Whatever happened to this neighborhood? 2008 really had nothing to do with it i think long island city western Queens was probably immune to that. I think some people were able to buy some cheap property afterwards or some people went bankrupt or whatever you know. But I think the real cheap stuff happened before 2008 and that was part of the problem people got too good of a deal. [00:25:48] Aziz: what are the best responses you have had in your work? [00:25:57] Mr. Edjo: The best responses I've had to my work well as a visual artist when I'm sculpting, and I see someone stop and really stare at it and you can tell when someone is really drinking something, and you know. And when I see that you know a tear literally comes to my eye at the foot. The idea that I could affect it affect someone that way you know it's really important to me that I have I've had people think my work is grotesque and I don't see that they do, and I think it's nice that it had such an effect on them. But that's not the effect I want because to me they really are beautiful. There's an emotional struggle behind the sculptures. Both for me to produce them and for the characters you know they're mostly in stages of struggle or release. But to see someone really be affected by my work at the beauty of it is really powerful. I mean that brings it all together and to have the work be part of the conversation is probably the most important thing to me. I would rather give the piece to a museum and have it be on public display for free than sell it to someone for twice its worth and how to sit in someone's library personal library or something or have them store it for late you know like I'd rather give it away and have it be part of the conversation so that it can affect people as an artistic director as someone who runs art spaces. Seeing people. It's the exact same thing seeing people walk into a space and feel transformed feel like they're really experiencing something and with that is promoting the careers of these artists. I mean some of the artists we are working with are pardon my French they are fucking amazing. I mean they are just brilliant artists and they're prolific. They're not the I can't stand these artists that like you know are waiting for inspiration or you know I don't know whatever I mean I'm everything is okay with everyone whatever your process is that's fine but I like working with artists who are like are dedicated on the daily basis who have a certain amount of discipline to their work and even if they don't necessarily like what they're doing the show pushing forward still learning they're still. I mean it is what they do. Right so I want to see them get promoted. I want to see their careers move forward. I want to create a space where that can happen and if it's a musician or an actor you know we've had some amazing art in this space performance art Tana's who are performing arts director is responsible for bringing in 90 percent of the amazing arts that we're that we're doing here let's just see that I'm trying to see people at one of the plays we produce cry to be able to look because you know I see the plays ten you know so after a while you're not only looking at the play you're while you're watching the audience responses and you look down the row you know that you're in are to kind of go off to the side and watch the audience responses and to see like 10 people in the audience crying now my goal is to make people cry. But the goal is to emotionally affect people and I think that's what we do. I think that's what we're doing. That's my favorite part that�s the best responses crying people. [00:30:05] Aziz: let's talk about your old neighborhood. What is your first home? [00:30:16] Mr. Edjo: I was born in Tucson Arizona and I lived there all my youth. I didn't leave until my mid -20s and that's my first time. [00:30:33] Aziz: how did you live there? [00:30:40] Mr. Edjo: Yeah, I lived there I lived there until my mid-20s I mean I moved back a couple of times but when I came to New York that was. [00:30:49] Aziz: so was their neighborhoods Association. Do you know about it? [00:31:04] Mr. Edjo: the neighborhood associations like back home. Well I don't know if this is what you mean but like I have a group of guys that I've known since elementary school and that's that's my association. That's okay What's up. [00:31:39] Aziz: where did you get the news for what's happening in your neighborhood? [00:31:45] Mr. Edjo: Well when I was younger. Well it was the local news that my parents would put on at 10:00 p.m. every night and the morning newspaper which my parents read every morning you know there was no other way to get news on that. Again, no internet back then. [00:31:39] Aziz: what are the biggest changes experienced in your neighborhood? [00:31:54] Mr. Edjo: The biggest the biggest changes I've experienced in my neighborhood. Well that's an interesting thing about Tucson is it doesn't change that much. Tucson has remained the same. What's the biggest change. I got older. That's the biggest change me and all the people I grew up with are now almost 50. [00:32:00] Aziz: Why did you move to New York City? [00:32:34] Mr. Edjo: I originally moved to New York in general for the Arts. I had been actually earning my living as a stunt man and traveling around the country doing stage combat outdoor theater and film and television. And I wanted to get out of that. I wanted to get back into just acting actually which I was hoping would lead me to directing and I instantly got back into the right direction and stunts, so I came here for the Arts. I have frequently said if it wasn't for the arts, I wouldn't be I wouldn't be living in here. But I'm pretty dedicated to New York now. [00:33:10] Aziz: how the environment in Queens has changed throughout the years? [00:33:20] Mr. Edjo: Long Island City when I first started coming here 18 years ago it was a little bit more desolate. There was a lot more empty lots. There was a lot more empty buildings but it was. Things were already starting to get filled and they were already starting to build up, but I caught just the tail end of this being a vibrant arts community but still a little bit off the beaten path and over the past almost 20 years. It's become a lot more corporate. There�s tons of site skyscrapers and the amount of development is is intimidating and it's becoming expensive. There's no place to park you know the subways packed so I don't know if this kind of growth is sustainable thing. I think there's going to have to be better city planning here soon. [00:34:15] Aziz: in the past, how the community uses public spaces: for example, annual festivals and celebrations? [00:34:28] Mr. Edjo: How does the community use public spaces.in the past do you want me to lead that into currently. Yeah, I mean there's always been like arts fairs and arts organizations and I think now with social media and with social media it's easier way to bring people together. I think there's more organizations I think there's more groups. I think there is a better understanding that everyone has to work together that the ideas you can't just do your own little pocket thing that broadly we all have to approach public policy together. It's probably one of the biggest dilemmas western Queens is facing right now is how do the artists stay here. And I think one of the only ways artists are going to be able to stay here is if they partner with the people who have money who own the buildings who own the businesses who are developing stuff and who are making the policies you have to appreciate yourself and them you have to show that you have something valuable to offer a neighborhood. And that is no one wants to live in the neighborhood. That's not cool no plans to live in a neighborhood that doesn't have art you know so that's a little off topic but that's a really important aspect to this neighborhood. It was created. It's become popular because of the arts not created to become popular because of the arts. It's a cool place to live. There's lots of things happening. You can't just cement over all of it and put up glass domes right you have to work this element. This artistic texture back into the environment back into the neighborhood and the landscape. [00:36:10] Aziz: what are your predictions of change over the coming years in in the art world? [00:36:23] Mr. Edjo: Well I think I lead into that a little bit with a previous question because it's probably the most important thing that we're dealing with now is what is the future of arts again in western Queensland and more broadly and I think in a lot of urban centers and that is it needs to become of interest to people outside of the arts right. You have to make the arts. You have to work it into the policies of the city. If you don't. Every time a neighborhood becomes popular all the artists get pushed out the neighborhood becomes sterile and then eventually, I don't really know what happens to those neighborhoods you know. So, who is a fantastically successful area. It used to be a place for the arts but who lives in Soho now I mean like you know it's who wants. It's just a giant mall. You know and if that's what we want out of every single one of our arts centers like what Dumbo was what Williamsburg was. Long Island City is and maybe was you know it needs to be protected. I think a large part of that responsibility falls to artists. You have to start seeing yourself as a business person. You have to see yourself as someone who has to get along with these people. They are not people to fight. They are people who offer opportunity. We don't stop seeing them as others they're not. Others they're just they're just people and they might be business minded but art is also a business and you can make yourself more valuable by getting along with them and not seeing someone that should be that you should be fighting. In addition, they need to open up their minds and sometimes their pocket book and like you know have someone curate your lobby you know you have a more affordable housing than that lower economic groups can apply to. So, what's the change in the coming years. It's going to be a little bit more regulated. The days of the Wild West where you just take over some vacant building and turn it into a loft space is over. It's over that doesn't exist anymore. So where are you going to live and where are you going to work. Well we all have to stick together and create art centers places where there are studios where we can come together raise money together so that there are opportunities for all of us. I don't see any other way of making it happen or move someplace else where it hasn't happened yet. [00:39:08] Aziz: are there plans to expand the center in the coming years? [00:39:21] Mr. Edjo: Yes so the owners of the building want to keep us with their new plan and that would look like you know a space a little bit larger so that we can incorporate more opportunities for artists and be a little bit more stable to know that we're going to be you know I don't know we have a lease you know or we raised enough money to buy our own property or you know just a more stable situation where we can offer more opportunities so you know to have a dedicated performance space to have a dedicated gallery space so we don't have to split those things you know we want to offer more studios who want to offer more education we want a full program. We want to be open seven days a week. You know so that's the direction we're looking. We're looking to we're looking to grow and it's only because of plaques all that we've been able to do this before. Plax all lent us the space. We really didn't have the resume to expand. And what they are doing for us for the organization and for the community by providing this space to become a fine arts community center is as far as I'm concerned. Priceless. No arts organization can afford the space that the black soil gallery is donating does right now. You know so we just want to take that and build on it just keep going in that direction. [00:41:00] Aziz: is there anything you would like to add? [00:41:08] Mr. Edjo: you're a good interviewee, thank you for your time. I would like I would like to add that I think I think since this is for the archives you know I think what I would like to say is find out what's in your heart and be willing to work hard for it. You know don't make working hard a dirty word you know don't let people make you feel bad because you know what you mean you worked until 9 o'clock on something that's crazy. That's like well if you're loving it yeah if you love it and it's really in your heart you have to put in the extra time you have to be able to sacrifice something for it and maybe the question you shouldn't be asking yourself is what would what would make me happy what would I be. What would I like to do you know I think maybe a better question is what I am willing to sacrifice for you. I think that's an incredibly clarifying question. [00:42:07] Aziz: thank you so much. Mr. Edjo. ",

This is because the Stuyvesant High’s population at the time was mostly Jewish and Chinese. 0:11:12: Darryl addresses working in the field of HIV and AIDS for the past twenty-five years. He is the co-director of a program that allocates funding and services to everyone living with HIV and AIDS in the city as well as Westchester. He also works in mental health, housing, nutrition talks about the structural barrier that race and gender play on healthcare. 00:13:22: Mr. Wong studied abroad in France where he realizes how Asians are far more integrated into French society. He compares how Asians are integrated in French society versus American society. He also notices the fashion trends of homosexual men while living in France. Being in France and adapting to their popular culture by reading GQ magazine, led to him questioning his own sexuality. 00:18:54: Mr. Wong would visit his family in the Village after school during high school. He noticed the aesthetic trends of hyper homosexuality such as chaps during his time in the Village. 00:20:34: Darryl shares the experience of being forced into heterosexual dating. Mr. Wong left for college at sixteen years old and dated a woman for seven years. They continued to date until he realized the dilemma of not being sexually attracted towards her. During this time, he described that there was pressure to remain in the closet if you wanted to have start family. Many of these eye-opening experiences while living abroad in France led him to start identifying as a bisexual. 00:23:29: Mr. Wong entered CDC [Center for Disease Control] Vaccination program after college and worked in Africa (Country?). Due to (Country?) being colonized by the French the influence of European sexuality once again surfaced in his life. By then Mr. Wong was a twenty year old with an opportunity to actively explore his sexuality. After returning to his residence in the United States that he shared with his girlfriend and their relationship fell apart. 00:26:03: Mr. Wong worked for Merrill Lynch which was a predominantly white heterosexual finance firm. Colleagues would try and set him up on dates with women. He felt social pressures of being in the wrong career and the wrong romantic relationships. During the beginning of AIDS crisis, homosexuality became something to joke about more than before. 00:28:34: Darryl met his husband Michael in 1985. The two met for the first time in an Asian bar on the East side of Manhattan while he was in his early thirties. At that time Mr. Wong lived in Manhattan while, Michael lived near his Jewish family near Flushing. They moved in together in Flushing in 1990. 00:32:43: Mr. Wong and Michael marched together in the first ever Queens Pride Parade in 1993 with Michael’s two nieces from Florida who shouted, “We’re here. We’re Queer. Get used to it!”. He explains the complications of using gender pronouns and familial titles. 00:35:53: Darryl and Michael prominently displayed a rainbow flag in their house. This overt display of PRIDE symbolism allowed them to meet five homosexual couples in the neighborhood. One of these couples lived only two blocks away and had been a couple for more than forty years. 00:37:25: There was much talk in Flushing about “wasting syndrome” which was an effect of the AIDS virus. Men who had the syndrome lost weight rapidly and would be shunned as they walked by. These instances occurred during the height of the AIDS epidemic during the late 1980s and continued onto 1990s. 00:38:41: The AIDS March on Washington occurred in 1987 and was spearheaded by ACT UP, an organization that lobbied legislators to speed up AIDS related healthcare and work to stem the high AIDS mortality rate. ACT UP’s efforts were directed at the FDA and the federal government to devote more resources to controlling the epidemic by releasing AIDS related drugs. The popular stereotype for developing Aids was being one of the 3 H’s: Haitian, Homosexual, and Hemophiliac. 00:41:32: Darryl was influenced by Larry Kramer, leader of ACT UP and Vito Russo, author of Celluloid Closet. 00:42:59: A young white boy Ryan White with the AIDS was denied a blood transplant because of his condition. Ryan who was a hemophiliac passed away in 1990. Government officials were quick to act on his death as a political means because Ryan’s death did not fit with the usual 3 H’s (Haitian, Homosexual, and Hemophiliac). Their political efforts led to the development of the Ryan White Care Act which is on the books to this day. 00:46:12: Darryl speaks about the fear associated with having AIDS. He was constantly going to funerals and wondered if he'd be next. He got tested in Queens at the Corona health facility and found out he was HIV positive at thirty-four years old. 00:51:02: Darryl teamed up with APACHA (Asian Pacific Islander Coalition on HIV/AIDS). 00:56:45: Darryl reported a story about a pre-op transsexual woman not being properly examined by a healthcare practitioner and leaving the office without knowing they should have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 01:00:32: There is approval of homosexual couples in Flushing when heterosexual couples see that they share the same values. When a baby is brought home friends and family say hello, bring gifts, and are friendlier than ever before. Darryl reveals the struggles of moving into Flushing as a homosexual couple and explains how a real estate agent attempted to stop them from moving into the neighborhood. 01:05:04*: This portion related to Mr. Wong’s adoption process was excised according to Mr. Wong’s wishes. 01:06:37: Darryl and Michael were challenged during their decision to adopt a child from China because of their homosexuality. The adoption process took place in 2000. Michael had to write a letter of declaring his heterosexuality. 01:16:09: Having a daughter in the gay community was frowned upon and looked at as too conventional. Darryl and his husband lost friends when they decided to settle down and have a family. 01:25:19: There is a rising acceptance of sexual diversity. It is no longer permissible to make fun of homosexuality. 01:26:48: Darryl speaks about the precarious position Asian in America face as being stereotyped as a model minority. He speaks about how Asian and Whites are always grouped together by statisticians. He refutes the model minority stereotype by talking about the poor Socioeconomic conditions in Chinatown. 01:29:25: Darryl remembers two Asian neighbors running into their homes when they found out that they lived in close proximity to homosexuals. Those two neighbors never spoke to Darryl or his family again. They both assumed that Darryl was married to a woman. 01:30:40: Darryl shares hopes for equal opportunities in the LGBTQ and AIDS/HIV communities going forward and hopes that society will be better equipped to better deal with racism. 01:38:25: Darryl reminds the listener of the importance of older generations shaping younger generations. He also speaks about American society’s habit of disregarding the old as unimportant and invaluable. He is satisfied that his daughter is so close to his mom. ",

  "Wu_Julie_timecode.txt": "“It’s like my home” When Julie Wu isn’t hemming pants, making curtains, tapering skirts, exchanging zippers or accepting clothes for dry cleaning, she has coffee and chats with her husband and the friends who come to visit her. “I’m still working because I love my store. I love Sunnyside. It’s like family,” says Julie, a Taiwanese immigrant who has worked as a tailor in Sunnyside since 1979. Although she spends 13 hours a day in her store on 43rd Avenue, often seven days a week, work rarely feels like work. “It’s like my home,” she says matter-of-factly. “People say, ‘You must be tired!’ But I feel so happy every day.” To her customers, many of the challenges Julie faces are invisible. She is currently experiencing her toughest time yet. While costs associated with the store have risen—the rent, for example, has increased from $250 to over $1,600—her alteration fees have remained almost the same. But not even the robber who once ordered her to empty the cash register was able to foul her spirit. “You know,” Julie chided the young man, “I work very hard for my money.” Remembering the incident, she laughs. “So he dropped the quarters and left.” Shortly after her arrival in New York Julie started out as an apprentice at Band’s Cleaners, named after the Jewish couple who then owned the business. She didn’t even know how to sew a button and still vividly remembers the first time she hemmed a pair of pants and almost stitched two of her fingers together. Yet after two months, Julie convinced the owners to sell her the store for $2,000. Initially Julie had a lot of older Jewish customers who asked her to take in or let out their worn clothes as they gained or lost weight. Her new immigrant customers, on the other hand, may ask her to hem three pairs of brand new jeans at once. Before Julie came to New York, she lived with her sister in Spain for four years and is fluent in Spanish. “When I left Spain, I didn’t know I had such a treasure in my life,” she says, adding her Latin American customers sometimes laugh at her Spanish because her accent—European Spanish mixed with a Taiwanese accent. But overall they appreciate to be able to convey to her the alterations they wish her to perform in their native tongue. ",

There are people in arts, people in finance, people in you know all sorts of careers. They�re very supportive regardless of what you do. We try to come as much as we can, but sometimes we can�t make it over. In Astoria there�s a sizable Taiwanese community though it�s not that concentrated: we congregate here on Sunday�s because of the Church. My parents brought me over because they wanted a better public education system. They are firm believers in public education, but didn�t feel like the system in Taiwan was as good at the time.

  "_Akim-Rahim_timecode.txt": "Rahim and Akim are friends, both originally from Algeria. Rahim is a network engineer and Akim drives a yellow taxi cab. They talk about how coming to the mosque is for prayers but is also a good opportunity to see and catch up with friends. They conduct daily prayers wherever is convenient; at the different mosques throughout Astoria, or when a mosque is not possible, wherever they happen to be. Rahim mentions he has lived in many different parts of the world; usually it�s �the same people and same way of life�. He also talks about the way in which after an incident like 9/11 blame is targeted at the whole Muslim population � whereas when people of other religious beliefs are involved it is the individual, not the religion as a whole, which is blamed. �There�s bad and good everywhere�You can�t generalize.� Context of interview: �30th Ave � A year in the life of a street� project (www.30thAve.org). Transcript notes for research Rahim [R]: My name is Rahim. I�ve been here about 10 years. I am a network engineer. Akim [A]: My name is Akim and I�ve lived here almost 22 years here in Astoria. R: We both are originally from Algeria. I come to the mosque when I have a chance. There�s no counting, you know. From what I know this mosque has been here a long time � at least before I arrived here. You come here and do prayers and go home, nothing special. You just do the pillar. It�s part of life. And you meet friends, sometimes you see people you don�t see otherwise during the day. It�s both things � you do prayer and you get to meet your friends. A: A mosque is a mosque, it�s a house of God right, so we come here to do the five times praying a day. And like my friend says, it�s whenever you have a chance. It doesn�t have to be this particular mosque, we have like five or six of them around here. So if you caught, you know if you�re stuck in Steinway Street we have to pray there, we don�t come here. If I lose the timing then I pray wherever, in the house. R: Prayer is not linked to a mosque. You can do it anywhere, in a park, in a house, restaurant, wherever you are. A: But the group mosque is important. Praying in a group at a mosque, the rewards is much more better, bigger than doing it by yourself. Doing it by yourself you get one point. Doing it in the mosque you get 27 points. You�re collecting more goods. The more you collect goods the more you will be saved at the end of this life, at judgment day. That�s how I believe, you know. I drive a taxi. Yellow cab. No [don�t enjoy it]. But I do it. It�s a living you know. R: A job is a job. There are people from everywhere. From Asia, Africa, Europe. A: All the continents. And different cultures. You come you do what you do and that�s it. Sometimes they offer food here, some exotic food, and you go for it, otherwise you leave. Fridays is like Christian Sunday. And you�d see more people coming here on Friday. R: Re. Sep 11th: There�s bad and good all over. If you look at McVeigh in Oklahoma, he�s not a Muslim. Sometimes what you notice is if something happens when someone�s Muslim, they go after everyone, they put more pressure. But if it�s someone from another religion, they say it�s ok, that guy did it, they don�t say Christians did it, they say Timothy McVeigh did it. But if a Muslim does it they say Muslims did it. So they�re generalizing, taking advantage of it, with the community. That�s what we feel. It happened so it happened, it�s not in your control. There�s bad and good everywhere. As a human being. In the first place we are all human beings. You can�t generalize. The changes here, well the police have statistics which show Astoria is much better now. As Muslims have moved in here there has been less burglary, it�s become safer. It�s the police saying that not me. I don�t know if I�ll stay in Astoria. You don�t know what comes after you know. Nobody knows what comes. You might be here, then somewhere else, maybe in Europe. Maybe in Africa. It�s all the same really, mother earth you know. Wherever you are going is the same people and same way of life. People are not really different here or somewhere else, it�s all the same. I�ve lived a little bit in New Jersey, Brooklyn, Manhattan, you know, all over. A bit in England, a bit in Africa. I�ve been in a different areas. And it�s the same way of life. You go to work, you have your family, basic. How people behave in an area makes it good. Astoria, Manhattan, what�s the difference, you know. Maybe just that in Manhattan people are richer, that�s all. But what�s the difference, you know? In Astoria, the real estate is cheaper and in Manhattan it is expensive, that�s the difference. A: Astoria used to be cheap, not any more. Yes the rents going up. Since the crisis, people can�t afford the rent in Manhattan, so they move over here, and what�s happening is by moving over here, the rent also gets higher over here. I�ve been in three different places in the last 22 years in Astoria. I�m right here on Crescent Street and 31st Avenue. R: You should come here to the mosque when they have food �they have it once a month. On a Saturday every month. ",
  "_Bill_timecode.txt": "“There was a lot of drugs, shooting and killing. Now it’s coming back to what it used to be.” I met Bill, who has lived in Sunnyside for 60 years, the day before Christmas eve at the corner of Queens Boulevard and 46th Street. He was sitting on his rolling walker in front of the corner deli as trains were rattling by above. At first I thought he was selling the apparel displayed behind him. But it turned out he was just people watching to pass the time. Bill’s favorite thing about Sunnyside is the diversity of the people. “It used to be German and Irish,” he says. “Now it’s Spanish, Asian – Phillippino, Indian – and Irish.” Bill broke his back four years ago in his apartment just south of Queens Boulevard. Luckily he can slowly move around with his walker. But his physical therapists say that he will never completely recover from his injuries. A former shipping and receiving clerk at a factory in Woodside, Bill has seen Sunnyside drown in drugs and violence—and he has seen it recover. “It changed an awful lot compared to what it used to be,” he says. “There was a lot of drugs, shooting and killing. Now it’s coming back to what it used to be.” Bill likes to read in his spare time and shops for books at the One of a Kind Thrift Shop on Queens Boulevard between 45th and 46th Streets. Bill used to enjoy eating out but now can’t afford to do so anymore. He gets his groceries from Keyfoods right across the street but since the price hikes last summer struggles to make ends meet. ",
  "_Charlie_timecode.txt": "“We become friends and it just grows and grows.” When Hoover sees Charlie he gets so excited that he pulls his owner across Skillman Avenue. Hoover would never forgive himself if he missed his daily bone-shaped biscuit—and his friend Charlie, of course, whose pockets are brimming with dog treats. “Hoover, he’s number one,” Charlie says. “Are you kidding?” (This, by the way, I can confirm; Hoover and I are neighbors.) Charlie has been handing out dog biscuits in Sunnyside for the past 30 years. In the early morning hours he walks his nine-year-old Cocker Spaniel Buddy around the block. Since Buddy gets irritable when Charlie shares biscuits with other dogs, Charlie drops him off at his apartment. After a breakfast at Skillman’s Famous Pizza and Coffee Shop, an unassuming diner that was briefly closed down for health code violations, Charlie takes his seat in front of the laundromat and begins his daily routine. “That’s how I make a lot of friends: petting their dogs,” Charlie says. “We become friends and it just grows and grows.” Some dogs are on a diet and not allowed to fill up on treats, and Charlie respects that. When he meets a new dog, he always asks his owner first whether it is okay to pet the new canine friend. But the next question is about the cookie. If your dog needs a treat and a pat on the head, Charlie’s summer hours are from 7 AM to 8 AM. ",
  "_Cosmos_timecode.txt": "“Words like homeless I do not understand. Home is where your heart is.” On a recent Friday at noon Cosmos sat on a milk crate in front of Red Wing Shoes on Queens Boulevard. Dressed in colorful African garments, he alternated between drums, maracas, the flute and tambourines, creating what he calls “the melting pot sound,” improvisational music inspired by New York’s myriad cultures and street sounds. “Everything is music to me,” he tells me. “The birds, the pace of people’s feet. There’s a certain rhythm pattern in the cars coming to a stop. They sound like the ocean at the seashore.” Cosmos attributes his love of music to the fact that his mom played the mandolin while she was pregnant with him. Born to a family of West Indian immigrants, music permeated every moment of his childhood. Each birthday he would get a new instrument, and home was where he could make music, rather than the physical structure over his head. “I have an interesting idea of territory,” Cosmos says when asked where he lives. “Words like homeless I do not understand. Home is where your heart is.” And in his heart, he says, he feels a strong connection to Sunnyside, where he has played for 25 years. He suspects “a magnetic current running through Sunnyside that has everybody aligned.” In Sunnyside no one has ever told him to leave. Some people stop just to listen, others to give him a couple of dollars or to tell him that they will be out of town for the weekend but back in touch when they return. “Every soul is a valuable asset,” Cosmos says. He avoids “the industries” and rarely records what he plays. He prefers to play in front of a live audience. He tells me that playing for patients at the psychiatric institution on Ward’s Island, where he once worked in food services, led them to open up in ways words alone could never accomplish. When he gets tired of playing, Cosmos takes a short nap or juggles clear plastic bags adorned with rainbow-colored ribbons, an exercise he invented to enhance his endurance and coordination. His Indian ankle bells jingle as he jumps up to catch the bags in the wind. ",

  "_Manuel_timecode.txt": "Manuel, a member of the Salvation Army Church, is an undocumented immigrant from Lima, Peru. All his life he has been living with his family until he decided to come to the United States country with the purpose of improving his spiritual life. He feels that his economic livelihood comes second to his spiritual life. Manuel has studied music from childhood (since when he was five years old) at the National Conservatory of Music, where his father worked since 1988. He came to the United States to take advantage of his university�s Cultural Exchange Program. He recounts his experiences while living in this country. Manuel is devoted to his faith in God and he would like to devote himself entirely to God if he has the opportunity. 00: 00:20 Manuel has always lived with his parents, and his two siblings. When he was five years old he began to study music at the National Conservatory of Music continued to study there until he was 16 years old. He began to pursue a career in music and he studied the career of oboe approximately three years. Unfortunately Manuel had to leave his oboe studies until his oboe was stolen. Manuel could not afford to purchase another oboe. After completing high school Manuel enrolled in at University Inca Garcilaso de la Vega to study nursing, a prospect that he continued until his fourth year at school. He did not complete his nursing studies. The first job Manuel took in Peru was working at a McDonald�s, in La Molina. His second and more formal job was teaching as a music teacher at the German School Johannes Gutenberg. He taught morning classes at this school until 2012. In 2010 Manuel joined the Peruvian Air Force which had assimilated the military band. Before coming to the United States, he worked as technical nurse at the Vitarte Hospital. 00:04:00 Manuel was raised a devout Christian family home. In Peru he joined the Salvation Army�s musical band. In 2013, he applied to participate in a Cultural Exchange Program at his university. He was in his in fifth semester and came to the United State for the first time. He received a short term contract for working at a YMCA resort located in the Colorado which ran from November to March. He found his first job here a very tough experience because it was a secluded place in the mountains, there was no public transport and he had no car. The resort provided to workers with shelter and food. This was Manuel�s first experience in the United States. 00:05:45 Manuel first came to United States, on a flight with a stopover in Houston, where he went through Immigration. From there he took another direct flight to Colorado. After completing his temporary job in Colorado, he decided to come to New York and contacted the Salvation Army. Here he was in New York City for almost month. Manuel knew that had some unfinished matters in in Peru that he had to wrap up. Some of these matters included seeing his younger graduate his high school. In 2014, he returned to Lima, Peru and began working at the Vitarte Hospital. In 2015, Manuel applied to the same Cultural Exchange Program again. Manuel worked in Colorado from November until March 2015, and then he came to New York for the second time. 00:07:41 Manuel decided to come to New York because he wanted to find a new home, a new life, and a new future. He gives \"thanks to God\" for escaping the economic troubles of Lima. During his second time in New York City he became familiar with the city and was able to navigate it with confidence. Manuel�s first job in New York City was a dishwasher. He later obtained employment with the help of his former employers at the Salvation Army. He landed a music related job in Jackson Heights. He describes his job as \"now I belong to the band of bronze and also to the choir of Manhattan.\" 00:09:13 Manuel works Monday to Friday. Although other employment opportunities have shown up, he does not follow through with them because he wants to devote his free time with the Salvation Army. He claims intentions �is not to make money here, but to start a new life� and \"I know that God has plans for my life.\" 00: 09:50 After working at YMCA, Manuel found employment at a restaurant called \"La Porte�a\". This time he was not sure if he had to stay or to return to his country: \"I cried and asked God to give me direction.\" He says that he talked with his family, but for that time it happened something very unique in the restaurant where he was working as busboy: \"an afternoon I was working and I was also praying. I said: Lord give me a sign if I should stay or go back to Peru\", because his visa still did not expire. Another day while he was working folding napkins he was also praying, and at about three in the afternoon, suddenly: \"it began to fall fire... from the front of the restaurant fire was falling down.\" It was located on the first floor... on the street people heaped, worker could not leave out the premises, then they realized that there was fire in the building, then firefighters arrived, took them out, and they recently realized the \"tremendous fire that had on the second floor\" and at the top, \"so I took it as a sign that I had to go back\" to Peru. Until today that building is still empty. 00:13:50 Manuel already know that he can find another job, better and with a more suitable time for his needs and he knows that remuneration can also improve. The first time that he came he took the first job he found, he did not know how much the minimum wage was, he did not know that there were other options, other different schedules. 00:14:15 Manuel has known immigrants and Americans here: \"when I have rehearse and in Manhattan for the choir and the band, then all are American, but in the jobs where I have been all are Hispanic (in this area of Jackson Heights all are Hispanic).\" 00:14:50 Manuel manifest that he have listened to speak of discrimination that there is toward Latino people, and he believes that \"discrimination comes of a Latino towards another Latino rather than of an American to a Latino, because in the places in that he has worked and he has had contact with Americans they has been very good people.\" He manifest that on the two occasions that he was in Colorado Americans have respected him very much, he was treated with great kindness, even bosses asked please all that they indicate that he had to do, everything was requested with much respect. When you have worked with Latinos, when they ask for something to other Latinos, sometimes they ignored the \"please\" word and omitted to thank... Manuel said that sometimes when he asked for any advice, any direction, if he could get another better job and the like to some Latinos, they said \"�I do not know�... There was no any desire for helping another Latino, and when he did the same consultation to an American, maybe they had not passed for the situation that I was spent, the immigration status I had, but however he told me (�): I'm going to ask, I will see where you can get a job, where you can study, take a course, or who can give you some donation of food, clothing, and they even had more interest and more will for helping a Latino.\"he did the same consultation to an American, maybe they had not passed for the situation that I was spent, the immigration status I had, but however he told me (�): I'm going to ask, I will see where you can get a job, where you can study, take a course, or who can give you some donation of food, clothing, and they even had more interest and more will for helping a Latino.\" 00: 16:58 Manuel says: \"now I am working in a bakery and my coworkers are Latinos... bosses are born here (their parents are from Egypt), and they are very friendly.\" My coworkers talk almost nothing and when I do any consultation, since they have lived years here, they do not give me any information. In Church people are different because �we're like a brotherhood.\" But a person outside of the church does not have that will. 00:18:05 When Manuel says that the two occasions that he has been here they were very strong shocks, because '' I've always been very close to my family, we have lived all together\" (they were three siblings and two parents). In Colorado he had no mobility and he could not go to Church or the Salvation Army because the closer was far away, three-hour driving and he had no car. \"There I felt lonely\", then in New York things changed a bit by the facility that I have to move, to walk, \"and I had the Salvation Army here, which is like a family (�) When someone comes from anywhere in the world and is a member of the Salvation Army, they receive him as a family.\" Manuel also adds that \"I feel that the music was also very important because it opened doors and connected me more with the people.\" Now he cannot feel alone because he can talk with his family by Skype and by Messenger, so he talks always, then he already do not feel loneliness. 00: 19:51 Manuel thinks that much of what is said about Latinos is true, unfortunately, it is true. Sometimes, is talked about dirtiness and crimes: \"bearing in mind what I've experienced, I think that it is true. I have had several experiences... recently someone stolen me my wallet on the 7 train (�) Climbing I saw that they were all Latinos who were around me, there were no Moreno or Americans\", then he thinks that a Latino was the one who took his wallet. Miguel says that sometimes we want all Latinos for supporting among us, but we must be realistic: sometimes they pull a paper and not collect it (as opposed to an American), sometimes they cross the track when the signal is red, they are not all, but �I feel that only a small proportion of Latinos care for this country and they show some degree of education \", but unfortunately this speaks poorly of all Latinos. 00:21:52 Manuel says that he wants to start a new life here, \"If God wants, I would like to start a family (�), to have children and start all over again here. Now my goal is to have a generation that, from my person, grow in a different place as it is this country (...) It is not easy, but I trust in God and if I am in this place is because God has allowed it, he has plans for me, I'm not saying that it has to be soon, but I trust in God, and if he will open the doors, it will open.\"God has allowed it, he has plans for me, I'm not saying that it has to be soon, but I trust in God, and if he will open the doors, it will open.\" 00:22:56 Manuel knows that not all persons with whom he has relationship are such believers as he is, but �I respect the beliefs of each one. I don't want to impose my beliefs, but these are on the basis of God (�) I am one hundred percent sure and have great faith in what I believe.\" 00: 23:22 Manuel points out that \"if I'm on the train and I see a brawl, a fight or an act of racism by certain people to some Latinos (�), if I have seen the full context of how it was given, and I feel that it is unfair what is happening, I could intervene in a respectful way, I would try to see if with what I say I can solve that verbal discussion. But if I'm in a place and I do not know how the situation has been started and I just only see that there is a type of attack, I could not intervene because it is unclear which of the two parties is right.\" 00:24:52 Manuel says that \"if we talk about politics... well I have heard what it has said the elected President of this country, that he will deport more than two or three million undocumented who have legal background or who have committed a crime, then by that side have no fear (...) God is who gives me security, tranquility, calm, peace (�) Regardless of who is the President, I think that taking God on my side I know that He will open doors and He will allow in my life what is His will.� 00:25:50 Manuel recalls that in Colorado, where he worked, \"had people of all countries, for the Exchange Program, and all had different types of beliefs. Even in Colorado, the consumption of marijuana is legal, then most of people smoked marijuana, they ate marijuana\", and he respected all that. He says that he has friendships, not so nearby, but that they not are believers, \"they do not share the same belief that I have and neither my faith (...) but they are friendships that one get to appreciate.\" Manuel has not had any kind of clashes with people of other faiths, \"because I think that people who are smart have to respect the beliefs of both of the other part and on my part (...) I feel that one chooses friends, that one knows with whom one wants to have a closer relationship, and never, thank God, I had a shock or a large discussion about my faith, it has never happened.\" Among the others who do not share their faith, and him, there is respect: \"I respect the way they are, but I do not share\" many things or actions that they have and they also respect his convictions even though they do not share their faith. 00:27:40 Manuel says that his father has visited him some time ago: \"I felt very happy, very happy, and I feel satisfied because I believe that he has been a person... he and my mom... that I have grown up with them and they have given me everything, that they have been outstanding the food, the payment of the light, the payment of... thousands of things when one is a boy in Peru (�) When one is young, adolescent... and this time (�) I felt full of give him back, even with a little, how much they gave me for so many years of my life (...) and now I was given him the comforts that he has given me throughout my life.\"payment of... thousands of things when one is a boy in Peru (�) When one is young, adolescent... and this time (�) I felt full of give him back, even with a little, how much they gave me for so many years of my life (...) and now I was given him the comforts that he has given me throughout my life.\" 00:28:43 Manuel manifests that this is a multicultural place, and he has friends from Spain, Ecuador, Mexico, England, Uruguay, Argentina... some are of his Church and others are not. In the works in which he has been it has had a mixture of nationalities. 00:29:36 Manuel says that psychologically he feels stable and quiet now, although he cannot no deny that, at the beginning, when he newly arrived, he had collided with this new life in a country that is too hard for working, and for living. There was �a little bit of sadness that you felt, I could say depression for remembering home, but now I feel very well, thanks to God that makes me feel quiet.\" He adds that \"the security for a Christian, for someone who believes in God and who shares our faith (...) not is in us, not is in my own forces, in what I can achieve as my work or as Manuel, but our security lies in God, by that is that I am quiet, that I feel safe psychologically. I feel that my dad is gone physically, my biological father, but God, who is my spiritual father, is always with me.\" 00:30:54 Manuel says that he has his mom inside his mind and his own expression tells us that he misses her so much: \"I love my dad and my mom, but I have always had a slightly closer relationship with my mom. I miss her a lot, but thanks to technology I can talk too her more than five times every day... sometimes people here... or the American people who have grown up in this culture� they do not have such closeness\" and they are surprised when they see him talking to her three or four times a day. He says: \"I don't know about other countries, but with Latinos I've heard that it is also the same (�) I miss her, but I always speak with her, so I don't feel so much that she is not with me.\" 00:32:00 Manuel tells us that he wants to establish a family: \"That is the desire of my heart, if God allows it\", that is the idea that he has put in prayer. He thinks that is God who opens the doors, and he takes that it is the will of God that he is here. �I am not here because I want to become a millionaire, because I want to work (�) I know many people who work from Monday to Sunday, who work at night and have enough money. This is a country that, thanks God, has many opportunities for someone who wants to make money and I must thank to this country and thank God that allowed me to... and I bless the new President, but is not the engine and reason why I'm here.\" Manuel is in this country only to \"serve God\" and \"if given the opportunity to serve him full time� it is my desire� and starting a new life in this place.\" 00:33:14 Manuel points out that \"I could also serve God in my country, but it was the willingness of serving God here that brought me\", because the Exchange Program by which he came only allowed up to certain age (26 years old), however he was 27 years old and he made the program in less than a month before he traveled (perhaps fifteen days), and \"it was something incredible.\" At that time he was already working at the Hospital and had been keeping his money because he lived with his parents. Of course he supported in the House expenses, but some of his salary he had for himself and that money he kept it� And, suddenly, Manuel felt that he could go back to the Exchange Program while some people told him that he would waste his money, and that the visa would not be given to him. \"In the Exchange Program I had to pay the company that brings me, pay the visa (�) and that is a strong expenditure (such as 2000 dollars more or less).\" But contrary to those who told him not to do it, he arose because he had money saved and he didn't ask anything of his parents and, despite registering something late, the Agency accepted him� The agency that brought him in 2014 did not accept him because it was very soon, because their earlier trip was very close, so he went to another one that was more expensive. In this second agency they asked for his documents, it did not put any but and sent him a contract, and the total cost was less than it was the first time. 00:35:22 Manuel also says that \"all the doors were opened: I went to the interview and the Embassy did not ask me nothing, just it told me: is this the second time you're going to work at the same place? He answered �yes\" and after filling out the forms he was awarded the paper he needed... Manuel also says that he was serving God in Peru because he was going to the Salvation Army almost full-time: \"I was studying and all my free time I invested in the Salvation Army in Peru, with young people and music (�) but what I always really wish from the bottom of my heart it was to serve God in this place. Then I said: If that is your will, doors will open\", and that He did and \"I want to tell you that God has a plan for me in this place.\" 00:36:17 Manuel speaks about free will: \"will mean choice, then when the Bible speaks of will, it means that God gives us free choice. In His great love and mercy He allows us to take the final decision... He makes a plan for each of us, but... as a verse in the Bible says: I put life and death before you; I put the blessing and the curse in front of you. At the end, He does not oblige anybody, but He has given us the privilege of having free will and each of us can choose.\" Manuel believes that this could be complicated for people because there is always, for all things, two ways that one can follow: the good and the evil, and evil is always the most appetizing, \"evil draws more attention, it looks better and, by choice, one chooses the own path�, and it could be a different one that He has traced for each one of us� Manuel says that unlike other types of faith, of other religions that that is something mandatory and that parents impose on children, in Christianity, which is the faith he shares, that is not the case: in his Church parents instill (or teach) to the children, but the final decision is of each one, that is free will that God gives to each one, and it is each one who chooses the path to be followed.the own path�, and it could be a different one that He has traced for each one of us� Manuel says that unlike other types of faith, of other religions that that is something mandatory and that parents impose on children, in Christianity, which is the faith he shares, that is not the case: in his Church parents instill (or teach) to the children, but the final decision is of each one, that is free will that God gives to each one, and it is each one who chooses the path to be followed. 00:38:06 Manuel tells us: \"I was born in a Christian home, but that did not mean that I would have to be one of them, because there are many families who are Christians but their children are not, that they do not share the same faith (�) That's the wonderful thing about free will... I took the decision of follow the same faith that my parents had, the faith that they shared, and I myself made the decision to follow Christ, to be a Christian�, to go to Church and give his life to God and hold Christian values� �The journey of my life, the way of how I live my life, my actions, are governed by God, for what it's in the Bible (...) No one forces me, no one beat me to it, but that is a decision that I took. I had a personal experience with God� so during all my life, I follow both, the career of music as well as the career of nursing; it has always been a decision of my own and is what God has always put in my heart. I am not going to say that I have always taken the right decision, there have been moments in my life that, thanks to the free will, I made the wrong decisions and took roads that I should not have to (�) Like all human beings, we tend to fail, we tend to make mistakes, but, as the Bible says, as God says, He is faithful and just to forgive us from all sins.\" Manuel points out that it has made good and bad decisions, but it is the Word of God who forgives and shows the correct way to him. 00:40:39 The Salvation Army has given him many opportunities: in 2010, in Peru, he had the privilege of travelling to Holland and Sweden, by means of this institution, to a global Convention of youth of this Church in Sweden, where they discussed issues that dealt with the situations in their own countries and \"I had the privilege of being the only Peruvian who traveled to it.\" Manuel says that the Salvation Army is one family more for him and it has served and supported him here spiritually, emotionally and materially (it has provided him food when he spent time out of work), he always has the word of encouragement of pastors, leaders, brothers and all the friends he has there. This Church has a job in this country that focuses much on the social, as opposed to the Peru where jobs are almost unknown. However here, this Church is well known: they are responsible for giving free food and clothing from Monday to Friday. 00:43:08 Manuel thinks that New York has many similarities with Lima... When he talked with people from other States, when he lived in Colorado, they told him that this was a very dangerous and dirty city, and it was the oldest in the United States. He considers now that this city has a little bit of each one of those things. But, in general, he feels very comfortable here precisely for its similarity with Lima in many respects. Of course, security here is much better, he says... New York is a city where you can find all kind of things, in others States it is very difficult to get some things... When Manuel lived in Colorado, he missed quite Peruvian cuisine, but here he misses nothing because stores sell Peruvian products, and \"as I know a little cooking, I prepare same Peruvian dishes: I can find the ingredients in supermarkets.\" And, in this city, there are a lot of Peruvian restaurants, \"of course that I prefer cooking by myself for saving.\" 00:44:54 Manuel misses his friends, but it is not much because he can talk with them by Internet. Although he said he has friends that were very close in Lima, friends of whom he was talking every day and were all together... Recently he has read that when one travels, friendship can go missing in time, and he believes that that it is truth because now, that he lives here and his friends are in Lima, it is not the same as when they were physically close. Conversations with his friends have been reduced to the minimum. 00:45:34 Manuel missed Lima at the beginning, and he wanted to return, but now that his father has been visiting him, he considers that that has been as if he would have been in Peru again. In that brief time in which his father was with him, Manuel felt at home, in Lima. They were talking and distributing tasks of buying and cleaning. His father was coming to visit him, and \"brought the Peru and my home with him.\" He has had the idea of returning because it is not easy to be here. In this country works are tougher than those he had in the Peru. His father's presence calmed him a little, and he feels better now: \"Let's see how long\" he adds. Perhaps, he says, it last until he can return or his mom comes to visit him... Yes, he misses, but that makes him to see that now he has things clear and the goal drawn or the plan of life sustained by God�s will. Manuel is sure that everything is going well because it is God's will what it is happening, because if that would be not His will it would not happen, but He will show us the way� and it will be always one time to return. 00:47:05 Manuel does not know what things could make him different from so many others who have come in his same unlawful situation, he does not know the story of others. Although he clearly says that it has no sense to mark differences with others because each one makes the decisions of his life, each one makes a plan of his own life. Manuel adds that yes, he has seen, and knows, many things here, but he would not make any difference between him and the others: \"I can't find the sense of it.\" Manuel has been formed at Christian home and the other people have arrived of other types of households and he could not tell if a person is best or worst that himself because situations are different. Manuel can see, yes, that Latinos wasted their money on alcohol, which is very common in all the jobs that he has been: at the end of a working day, after midnight, they all gather all together for drinking and spending their money on that, which is for him unnecessary since it does not provide him any welfare in its health and it is a futile expenditure of money. Manuel says that he does not know from what kind of home those workers have come, he does not know if, at their homes, their parents also had drunken or had problems with alcohol� Some of them send money to their countries, but in the short time that he knows them he has no enough confidence with them and they did not tell him that kind things, and he adds that he also sends money to Peru.sense of it.\" Manuel has been formed at Christian home and the other people have arrived of other types of households and he could not tell if a person is best or worst that himself because situations are different.

That has surprised him. But he also met people to whom it was surprisingly easier to reach this country (and this was two years ago). He thought that it was impossible or very difficult to... Manuel has heard of things that are shocking experiences... He has a grandmother who lives in Peru now, but that she came across the border long time ago, and she had come in a bus, along with other people, inside the suitcases chamber, and in that place were children, women and men all squashed together, but he does not like to ask her any details because he felt uncomfortable. He only wanted to know, in a very general way, how it was. 00:54:43 Manuel has been a very short times in all his jobs: in a previous job he was four months and now he carries some six months... perhaps he has not still been enough time for having confidence with his coworkers... In the job that he has at the present, each one is tucked in his own things and no one talks. Even in the job interview for obtaining the present job, the boss said to him: \"here each one makes his own work, and nobody has to have interaction with almost anybody.\" And that is the real thing, because conversations with his coworkers are minimal, and what he knows about others is more because he listens to them talking, and that is something inevitable because they are all in the same environment, but each one has his own part while he is working, and each one knows what he has to do and nothing else� Inside the Church some has told him generalities, but nothing in detail: they have said to him that passing through the border was very difficult, and, for Manuel, that was a complicated experience, but he has not questioned beyond that point... Sometimes when he is on the bus, he listens to conversations on this subject, but he feels that it is very delicate to ask about that.he has not questioned beyond that point... Sometimes when he is on the bus, he listens to conversations on this subject, but he feels that it is very delicate to ask about that. 00:56:41 Manuel says that this is the first time that he has been surrounded by people from so many different countries for so a long time, because the experience of Sweden was shorter... He says that in Peru people were saying to him terrible things about this country, among them there were his grandmother and his aunt, they told him that here there are no jobs if you do not have documents, they said that all things are very expensive here. Other friends were telling him the same thing... But when he came to this country he could discover that that was not true and it was one of the surprises that he had when he came to New York, in particular. Perhaps the people discouraged him, Manuel thinks, by their lack of interest to help him, but he found that everything was different in this country: he feels that there is enough jobs: when you are looking for on the internet there are a lot of ads, in the same restaurants owners put them outside, and even he can find cheaper products in supermarkets than in Peru. 01:00:30 Manuel disagrees with those who say that Latino removed jobs to American people, because Latinos do not impose their wish of working, but are employers which hire them, so, employers take the decision and they have their reasons to do that... \"I think that it is a pointless affirmation or idea, because ultimately the decision is from the employers and they prefer to Latinos for x reasons, but the fault is not ours.\" 01:01:14 Manuel says that where he works currently bosses are Americans, but all workers are Latinos. 01:01:44 Manuel wants to add, before finishing this interview, addressing to people who live in Queens, that if you need any help, if you are without work or are passing difficult times for eating, you can reach to the Salvation Army and there you will eat free every day.

  "_Ormi_timecode.txt": "\"I am a picky girl. I’m too picky to pick.” If you find yourself at the supermarket on 43rd Avenue on a gloomy day, with a little bit of luck you might find Ormi cheerfully working the cash register and inquiring about your well-being. I complained about being tired one recent morning as she rang up the vegetables for my two pet rabbits (who refuse to eat lettuce from any other supermarket in Sunnyside). “Maybe you just need to do something. Sometimes tiredness goes away once you start moving…” I felt much better after taking Ormi’s advice and decided to meet with her at Café Aubergine after her evening shift. A challenge at first, the cashier’s job with its constantly changing prices and codes, its idle times and meager wage—in three years Ormi has worked her way up from $7.25 to $7.75 an hour —is only a temporary solution for her. She has always enjoyed taking care of her younger cousins and nephews and wants to turn her compassion for children into a profession. Hoping to become a social worker one day, she currently studies Human Services at LaGuardia Community College. Ormi moved to Sunnyside from Bangladesh six years ago. She says that among five siblings she is the shiest and quietest and had the most difficult time adapting to the new culture. She couldn’t speak any English and the first weeks she could barely eat; even the water tasted differently. While her mom tried to find the unique South Asian vegetables the family was accustomed to, the dishes didn’t taste nearly as fresh as they did in her home country. Worse yet, Ormi couldn’t find any of her favorite fruits—Kathal, Lukluki and Bubi—and she missed the elaborate wedding ceremonies where the women would prepare sweets from these fruits and bring them to the bride’s house. At age 20, Ormi is still very close to her mom and wants to stay with her until she gets married. But she thinks it will take some years to find a “good-hearted, good-looking, funny and educated gentleman.” She is not interested in an arranged marriage as is still the custom for many young people in Bangladesh. “What if the guy is the opposite of me? No ‘yes’ to a stranger!” She says, sipping her Coca-Cola at Café Aubergine. “I am a picky girl. I’m too picky to pick.” But between school, work and the usual hobbies (TV, music, reading the Twilight series), there is little time to think about dating. Besides, before Ormi picks the right guy, she still has to work on her shyness, she says. And with an admirable dollop of self-confidence she adds, “There is no problem with me. Either way, I will be fine.” * Name has been changed upon request. ",
  "_Sid_timecode.txt": "My name is Sid and I�m an EMT [Emergency Medical Technician] with the New York City Fire Department. It involves a lot of things - anything from picking up drunks on the street, to cardiac arrests, severe trauma jobs. We come from Woodside but we cover pretty much anywhere on the West end of Queens. We do eight hours or sixteen hours in each shift depending on the schedule. I mean helping people that�s the most important thing. All the stuff that we do, even though we don�t get rewarded by it, it�s a good feeling; we do a lot of things and pretty much New York City EMS, you know we don�t get the credit that we should be getting. While most of the stuff that we do, pretty much we have the New York City Fire Department in front of us, the fire department get the credit and we don�t get the credit for it. We go to fires as well, yes. Pretty much we take care of the patients; they take care of the fire. So whoever they bring to us, we take care of them. Half-dead, we bring them back alive, bring back here, and that�s the end of it. Some people, especially family members around, like half of them they say thank you; they come to you, others they just don�t really care. [What training do you have to do?]. Depending on where you do it, I mean I�ve been a volunteer for all my life. But on Long Island it�s about six months training. Here in the city it�s about a three months training. It involves first aid and basic life support, CPR including stabilizing patients, and that�s pretty much it. I also do it voluntarily � I�ve been doing it voluntarily. It works a little differently in Long Island because we do everything at once. We do fire, rescue, and ambulance first aid at the same time. While here it�s separate. Fire is fire, EMS is EMS. Even though Long Island has those as well but I think it works a lot better because everything is together. Over here it�s like one takes one side and one takes the other side. Over here this is my job, I get paid for it. But in Long Island, it was just the excitement, all the things that we used to do; I mean the volunteer fire department has everything. It was nice, I�m still doing it. I was born in Colombia. I�ve been in the States 27 years now. In 27 years I�ve been back like seven or eight times. It�s a little expensive to go down there! I came here when I was still a kid. So other than my family and some of my elementary school friends I don�t know anybody there, so it�s a little different. In this area the Colombian community isn�t so big. They are more towards Jackson Heights. And now they are moving out to Long Island, like where I am all the way out in Suffolk County. Lately there have been a lot of Colombian people moving to that area, from all over the place. [Future plans?]. Well first I want to become a paramedic, and I don�t know - maybe later on, try to go for a nurse or a PA [physician�s assistant], either way. The neighborhood around here is pretty good, you know depending on which way you look at it. There�s a lot of diversity around here. You get people on one side of the town Brazilians, on this side Italians, and then you get Middle Easterners on the other side, and then you come more on this side again and have people from�what is it�from Athens�Greek people. You see good interaction between the communities. "
