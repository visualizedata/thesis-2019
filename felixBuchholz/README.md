## Abstract

In a climate of polarization, a peculiar idea might have the potential to reach across political frontiers: the idea to grant every citizen a universal income guarantee. This project is not only an attempt to facilitate a nuanced debate about this policy and its possible effects on incomes in the US but also an offer to think about welfare and shared growth in general.
