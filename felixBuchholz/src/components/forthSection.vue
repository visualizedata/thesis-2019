          More elaborate financing models have been developed for various
          countries. Research also shows that the implementation of a UIG is not
          limited to developed economies. India can be regarded as a pioneer in
          this regard in terms of research and public debate on a universal
          income guarantee.

          Financing plans have to acknowledge the economic situation, the
          structure of government spending in general and specifically spending
          on welfare. One overall question would be whether the re-allocation of
          another government spending to a UIG is economically and politically
          feasible. Regarding the current welfare structure, it’s important to
          identify which programs have the character of a general government
          transfer and which are following an insurance paradigm, where
          recipients might object the loss of individually secured benefits.

          Advocates of a universal income guarantee argue that current
          inefficiencies in welfare and poverty lead to a significant amount of
          costs that are only implicit right now but will turn into a
          contribution of the costs of a UIG once it is implemented.

          One example is health costs. It’s generally acknowledged that there is
          a correlation between poverty and adverse effects on health and
          well-being. Data from an income guarantee experiment in Canada in the
          sixties showed a reduction of hospital visits of 8.5&#8239;%.

          To make observations and consequently estimates on overall dynamic
          effects like that, case studies are essential (although they have
          limitations as well). Two common concerns are if a UIG reduces the
          amount of time people are working and how the received money is spent.
          Case studies suggest that in both regards there is not too much reason to
          worry: Across studies, there is only a slight reduction of hours
          worked, the money is not spent on temptation goods like tobacco or
          alcohol and the time is spent productively, for more childcare,
          education or finding better jobs.

          Another approach to dynamic effects is to model people’s behavior with 
          optimization curves. Some researchers using these models expect the number 
          of total hours worked to drop significantly. Along these lines,
          another concern is relevant: who will continue doing unpleasant jobs
          if they can rely on a secured income floor? Employers would need to
          raise wages to create new incentives for these jobs resulting in
          increasing prices for previously low-paid services and products,
          ultimately diminishing the benefit of the received money transfer.

          From what I’ve learned so far, it seems that modeling people’s
          behavior is highly complex and sometimes involves simplifications that
          might be far off from reality. I haven’t found a compelling and
          exhaustive perspective on the effects of an income guarantee on work,
          wages, and prices. Estimations would have to consider the relationship
          between incomes and typical consumption behaviors in proportion. For
          example which wages might rise (or fall) will determine which products
          will get more expensive (or cheaper) only the amount of income people
          spent on these products will be affected by the price changes.

          Recently there has been an additional emphasis that a UIG might
          release creative potential that is currently devoted to make ends
          meet. Research shows, that poverty can have a detrimental effect on
          people’s problem solving capacities, which is similar to a significant
          dip in IQ. Advocates for an income guarantee argue that this potential
          could provide an immeasurable boost to innovation and productivity.

          Acknowledging the uncertainties around these dynamic effects, some UIG
          proponents suggest a step-by-step introduction and the constant
          evaluation of the program. Certainly, the effects will be different
          depending on the amount of the income guarantee, but considering the
          size of the program, it seems reasonable to gradually implement it. In
          a transitioning phase, it improves acceptance if welfare recipients
          can choose between existing programs and a UIG.
