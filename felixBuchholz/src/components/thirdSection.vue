          in regards to a fair share of growth, it’s essential to look at how a
          UIG would affect incomes.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          We will look at two different models
        </p>
        <ol class="intro">
          <li>
            In the first we can see  <a href="#graph-headline1">how a UIG set to a fixed amount affects incomes</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The second model also talks about financing: <br/>
            we will try to <a href="#graph-headline2">identify which current welfare can be replaced by a UIG</a>

      <div class="center-block">
        <p class="left">
          The first model model takes the approach shown in <a href="#graph-ideal-ubi">section two.</a> It is setting a fixed cash transfer per month as an income guarantee per person.
          <!-- <span class="bold">
           For example, &#36;&#8239;1,000 per adult and &#36;&#8239;500 per child per month.
          </span>  -->
            At the same time there will be a marginal tax rate of 50&#8239;%. For every dollar earned the net benfit will decrease by 50 cents. That means the benefit will fade out at a break-even point when earnings are twice as high as the fixed benefit amount.

          The previous model obviously doesn’t consider any financing of the new costs. 
          The next one is an attempt to account for that and puts a strong emphasis on
          <span class="bold">compatibility with the current</span>
          income tax model.

          Its strategy is to find out which current welfare transfers could be re-directed to an income guarantee to the lowest income groups.
          Using the savings of substituted welfare expenses it will determine a upper threshold and all incomes that are below it will receive a tax refund of 50&#8239;% of that difference with the annual tax returns.
          Because of this approach, it is is
          often called a
          <span class="bold">Negative Income Tax (NIT),</span> but other names
          like Basic Income are also sometimes used.

          At its conception, one of the main goals of this
          approach was to alleviate poverty. It is taking a step in
          that direction, but regarding this goal,
          <span class="bold">it can also be criticized:</span>  For example,
          <span class="bold"
            >an annual tax return might not be adequate in situations of urgent
            financial needs.</span 
          >
          To distribute the UIG at a household level might also create
          <span class="bold">financial dependencies.</span> Guaranteeing an
          income to every person might have more positive effects on individual
          freedom and gender inequality.

          If the goal is to eradicate poverty, why not try to design a model why
          not introduce an income floor no individual would fall below?

          In contrast to the NIT approach, it is evident that an income floor without replacing existing benefits
          adds a significant amount to the overall budget if the income
          guarantee should be above the poverty line. These additional costs
          have to be financed. Because it is obviously unsustainable, the solution to
          <span class="bold">print money is not an option</span> for UIG proponents.

          This can pacify fears of massive inflation due to the implementation
          of a UIG. But it also implies that
          <span class="bold"
            >any honest discussion about an income guarantee following the
            second approach has to address the fact that we need to re-think the

          There are various innovative approaches to shared growth. Some involve
          the introduction of <span class="bold">new taxes</span> (land tax,
          carbon tax, robot tax). Others want to create a sovereign wealth fund
          financed by a broad variety of sources (restructuring pensions, social
          insurances and shared profits of the use of common and natural
          resources). There are also voices that emphasize that
          <span class="bold">closing tax loopholes</span> would already finance
          a larger share of a UIG.

            >My personal guess is that any universal income platform or proposal
            can only be successful if it offers a balanced perspective on how
            growth and wealth should be shared across society. It should be
            regarded as justified, improving the overall well-being and cohesion
            of society and thus in the long term contributing to sustainable
            economic growth. In this regard it is crucial that a UIG is
            acceptable to potential beneficiaries as well as those stakeholders
            who will have to share more, the latter being more likely to have
            greater influence on shaping future policies.</span

          In this regard the static models, while being easier to calculate, can
