            The latest U.S. Presidential Election delivered a shocking and
            unexpected outcome that profoundly shaped the political, social and
            economic landscape of the country. After the final result became
            official, many took this as an opportunity to explore and
            investigate what were the main reasons that could explain its
            unlikely conclusion. It is safe to say that this campaign had a
            profound impact in all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we find ourselves in the midst of a fractured political
            landscape, I want to take us back to the beginning and I want to
            share with you a view of the election through the eyes of one of its
            closest allies: Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            South of the Rio Grande, the bilateral relations between the U.S.
            and Mexico, suffered a major drawback that has jeopardized years of
            close cooperation between the North American countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this historical turning point I was part of the international
            media analysis team of the former President of Mexico,
            <a
              class="anchor"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Peña_Nieto"
              target="_blank"
              >Enrique Peña Nieto.</a
            >
            On a daily basis and throughout the whole year, our team was in
            charge of monitoring over 200 media outlets from all over the world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 align">
          <p>
            Our main responsibility was to create and maintain a comprehensive
            database of all the news that were published about the country. This
            project is based on a subset of that database that covers 67 U.S.
            media outlets and 7,815 articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important component of this database is the labelling of
            the news according to their tendency. The classification system
            consists on four different categories:&nbsp
            <span class="positive labels">positive</span>
            <span class="negative labels">negative</span>
            <span class="balanced labels">balanced</span> and
            <span class="informational labels">informational</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In certain occasions, the explicit nature of the headline can
            provide us with all the information we need so we can determine the
            category for a particular piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this tends to be true for certain cases, our labelling process
            requires more context and that means reading the whole content of
            the articles. Let us explore an example of each category in order to
            see how that process worked.

                      nature of the treaty was a major concern between the U.S.,
                      Canada and Mexico during the campaign. In this particular

                      positive consensus in terms of commerce, energy
                      consumption and immigration policies. Nevertheless, the

            understand the workflow and the thought process that goes into the
            categorization of our articles, we can begin our exploration of the

            themes and the way they were perceived during 2016. The final
            visualization piece looks at the top 24 U.S. publishers of 2016 and

            The capture of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán represented a major victory
            for the Government and it dominated the narrative during the first
            months of the year. On February we notice a spike in the negative
            coverage after the Pope's visit to Mexico. During his trip, the
            religious leader met with victims of human rights abuses, reflected
            on the exploitation of migrants and the state of insecurity in the
            country. Throughout the year the Mexican Peso suffered major
            drawbacks as the Republican Candidate gained more strength during
            the Presidential Campaign. This also prompted several corporations
            to put on hold previously planned investments in Mexico.

            On September, after the Mexican President extended an invitation to
            the Republican Candidate in a desperate attempt to reconcile their
            contrasting points of view, Mexico became the main focus of
            international media. This unprecedented event coincided with recent
            polling results that recorded a new low for the President's
            popularity. Towards the end of the year we can see a positive
            resurgence after Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán got extradited to the
            U.S. Finally, after the victory of the Republican Candidate, many
            media outlets questioned the viability of his proposition to build a
            border wall and getting rid of NAFTA, this particular analysis
            caused the major spike in balanced news towards the end of the year.

            Despite the fact that this was a very unusual year full with
            political and diplomatic challenges, the main focal point of the
            majority of the stories revolved around security issues. Since
            former President Felipe Calderón declared war against the drug
            cartels in 2006, thousands of people die every year in what has been
            an unsuccessful strategy. Several human rights organizations have
            also pointed out that this war has led to many extrajudicial
            killings, and forced disappearances. Political stories concentrated
            on the diplomatic challenges between the U.S. and Mexico and the
            previously mentioned visit of the Republican Candidate. Even though
            the state of NAFTA was challenged during the campaign causing the
            constant fluctuation of the Mexican Peso, several car manufacturers
            such as VW, BMW, Ford and Toyota reiterated their commitment to
            invest in the country.

            Another positive point during this year was the increasing number of
            tourists that Mexico received. Despite the damaging rhetoric of the
            campaign, 2016 saw an increase in the number of U.S. visitors to the
            country. Finally, the lack of popularity of the President was
            reflected in the negative coverage of the Office. The image of the
            President suffered great damage before the visit of Candidate Trump.
            During the year it was published that he plagiarized his
            dissertation, the strategy he pursued against the drug cartels did
            not work and we saw an increase in the number of casualties, and the
            First Lady was involved in a corruption scandal after she spend some
            time in the apartment of a wealthy businessman that won a public
            bidding round to develop a major infrastructure project in Mexico.

            It is not surprising to see Univision at the top of the list since
            it is the largest provider of Spanish language content in the U.S.
            Although they concentrate on generating television content, their
            website publishes almost daily about the current situation in
            Mexico. Huffington Post operates in Mexico and the majority of the
            publications that we gathered are in spanish. La Opinión is the
            largest Spanish language newspaper in the U.S. and their main
            readers are located in the California region. Given the number of
            Mexican immigrants that live there, it is also expected to see this
            outlet up there in the list. Bloomberg is the first agency that we
            have in our list that produces their content in English and follows
            closely the economic side of the country.

            The Wall Street Journal is the most balanced and positive amongst
            the top tier newspapers (NYT, Washington Post, WSJ), whilst the NYT
            is the most negative even though it publishes less articles than the
            WSJ over the year. The most important aspect to notice in this graph
            is the fact that, with the exception of the LA Times and La Opinión,
            the majority of the news published by the media outlets along border
            (Arizona Daily Star, San Diego Union Tribune, Dallas Morning News,
            Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express News) were positive. The
            main reason behind this trend is the fact that their economies are
            closely interconnected to Mexico as a consequence on NAFTA, and the
            population stands against the expropriation of their land by the
            Federal Government in order to build a border wall.
