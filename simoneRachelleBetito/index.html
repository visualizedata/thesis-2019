                <h3>About Repatriation &amp; Why It's Important</h3>
                <p>
                    Museums are bastions of culture, they hold artifacts from all over the world. These artifacts hold different meanings to different people and some want their artifacts repatriated. Restitution is defined by Merriam Webster as
                  <span class="u"
                    >“the restoration of something to its rightful owner.”</span
                  >
                  Many authors have explored the impacts restitution has had on
                  art, museums, culture and the party making the return request.
                  However,
                  <span class="u">there is no universal approach.</span> This
                  framework is the main portion of the visualization and
                  proposes four pillars:
                  <span class="u"
                    >Symbolism, Legality, Morality, and Preservation.</span
                  >
                  Then we will apply it to a sample of the MET's (Metropolitan
                  Museum of Art in New York City) collection, as a test of reproducibility.

                <p>
                  Lately, there's been a push to return artifacts that have been
                  taken through colonization. In November 2018, France announced
                  it would return thousands of artifacts taken during their
                  colonial period. Startlingly,
                  <span class="u">
                    90% of Africa's heritage currently lies outside the
                    continent.

                  interchangeably throughout this visualization.

                  The repatriation model likely picked up on this item because
                  it meets the Preservation KPI's material assessment as a stone
                  sculpture and the geographical location of where this item was
                  made, Canada. The Inuit were historically marginalized so this
                  meets the Legality KPI. <br />
                  The provenance of this item is not entirely clear. On the
                  MET's website it says: "Said to be from: Port Harrison
                  (Inukjuak) James A. Houston, New York, until 1969". <br />

                  The repatriation model considered this item to be contentious.
                  Likely because it's an item from an Tlingit indigenous people
                  and for this symbolic meaning. The description on the MET's
                  site describes this item as: "This malevolent mask manifests a
                  powerful spirit being that helped a shaman mediate between the
                  worlds of matter and spirit".

                  The model picked up on a few American items, which makes sense
                  considering how the metrics were combined. Items in North
                  America scored higher. Not everything is required to be
                  repatriated if the item makes sense in its current location.

                    The preservation metric is a combination of two parts, the
                    materiality score and the risk assessment score. The
                    materiality portion was calculated by assessing the strength
                    of the material the artifact is made from. <span class="u">Materiality scale was measured as such: Clay = 1
                    Wood = 2 Ivory & Bone = 3 Stone = 4 Metals = 5.</span> The logic behind this is the stronger
                    the material, the easier the artifact would be to return
                    without damage from transport or the elements.
                    <br />
                    The risk assessment score was calculated from the
                    <span class="u">Peace Index Scale</span>, spcifically their regional scale from
                    most safe region to unsafest region. Regional scoring:
                    <span class="u">Europe = 1 North America = 2 Asia-Pacific = 3 South America
                    = 4 Central America & caribbean = 5 Sub-Saharan Africa = 6
                    Russia & Eurasia = 7 South Asia = 8 Middle East & North
                    Africa = 9</span>
                    <br />
                    The safer the region, the less risk of damage to the
                    artifact in the midst of transportation and relocation.

                    Morality refers to the opinion of the general public on the

                    of time. This way we can assess if an item is top of mind
                    for the region and part of the overall public's discussions.
                    If the <span class="u">Google search shows a higher search rate (>1000),
                    then the item is given a score of 1, if not, it is scored as

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              In the 18 and 19 centuries, increasingly unequal global power
              relations enabled European countries to accumulate huge numbers of
              cultural artifacts which found their way into their burgeoning
              museums. Ethnographic museums, in particular, have been the
              keepers of other people’s cultures, imposing their own
              classifications and interpretations onto objects from different
              peoples around the world: indigenous groups almost never had a
              voice. This model is intended to be a
              <span class="u">conversation starter.</span>
              Ideally, becoming a neutral voice in the repatriation discussions.
              Museums are a reflection of society at large and should not hold
              objects that have a contentious nature as part of their
              provenance. <i

                2-3). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition.</i
              >
            </br>
          </br>
              The model was a success in terms of its ability to bucket
              the samples into 4 distinct "shelves" and that it chose the
              appropriate items for those buckets. This framework is not intended to diminish past or present repatriation efforts. Museums are a
              reflection of society at large and provide a great service. As societies try to atone for past behaviours on
              marginalized communities,
