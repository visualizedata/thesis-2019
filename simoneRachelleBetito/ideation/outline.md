Tracing discourse of repatriation through geopolitical study

- I am tracing the discourse between countries involved in the repatriation of art through geopolitical study because I want to find out whether talks have increased in recent years.
- I am tracing the discourse between parties involved in the repatriation of art through case study of indigenous art because I want to find out who has more agency
- I am tracing the discourse between countries involved in the repatriation of art through geopolitical study because I want to find out if the repatriation of symbolic objects can help reconciliation between countries
- I want to research if looting of archaeological sites has increased due to political instability worldwide because I want to find out how this affects culture in order for my readers to understand the magnitude of the loss.

- I am visualizing indicators to facilitate art repatriation discussions while also keying in on a few case studies to hopefully increase reconciliation and nation building while similarly making museums more equitable places for all.
