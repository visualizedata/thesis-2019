    1) Intro:
    • Repatriation in the news. France is returning thousands of artifacts back to Benin as part of nation building.
    • Realizing that these items were taken away in a shady manner


    2) Problem:
    • There is no universal framework for repatriation. Usually it occurs when the museum decides to repatriate some of its items/at the museum's discretion. There is a power dynamic at play where usually the colonized people or marginalized people don't have a say in the repatriation discussions. I would like talks to be more equitable for marginalized communities and for museum-goers to have more awareness of provenance of artifacts. Museums have always been a special place for me and I want them to be more equitable.
    Think critically about provenance. Now let me take you through how I built this model

    3) Solution:
    • A model that builds on four key pillars:
    	○ Symbolism:
    		§ Does the item have symbolic value for a community?
    	○ Legality:
    		§ Was the item taken in a consensual manner? Has the country or community made the request for the return?
    	○ Morality:
    		§ The court of public opinion, search terms over time
    	○ Preservation:
    		§ Can the item be preserved outside of the institution?
    		§ Can the item be permanently loaned?

    • From there, the model can be applied to a museum's database and can be grouped into collection percentages.

In my visualization, I'm applying the model to a sample of the MET's overall collection

Materiality & Peace Index

Peace index scale (unsafe to safe):
Regional scoring:
Europe = 1
North America = 2
Asia-Pacific = 3
South America = 4
Central America & caribbean = 5
Sub-Saharan Africa = 6
Russia & Eurasia = 7
South Asia = 8
Middle East & North Africa = 9

Materiality scale (delicate to strong):
Clay = 1
Wood = 2
Ivory & bone = 3
Stone = 4
Metals = 5
