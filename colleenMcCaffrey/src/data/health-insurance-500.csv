Weeks passed with his pain getting worse. After numerous visits to the hospital  with no action he was finally diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of his left hip.In layman's terms  that means the femur head is no longer receiving blood  causing the bone to rot. Sometimes there are medical treatments to prevent the decay  but unfortunately Chris's femur head collapsed prematurely within months of the accident. This means he cannot walk or stand for a long time without having severe pain. Sleeping is virtually impossible without waking up from pain. Or sometimes the pain is so horrible he will have a seizure that causes him to pass out for a few hours. To go from an athletic ball of energy that used to walk the entire island that is his hometown  to not being able to leave the house without prepping days in advance  has caused a depression he fights every day. This gofundme is for a years worth of insurance at $400 a month  so $4800. This insurance has a $3000 deductible  doctors appointments are $25  specialist doctors are $50. Hospital visits are 20% after the deductible is paid. It also provides vision and dental  coverage he has not had since he was 18. This insurance is incredibly necessary to give Chris his way of life back  and the ability to provide for our family's future. The past two years have been rough monetarily  but we made it work. I absolutely cannot afford this insurance  but I will do everything possible to give Chris back stability.  We just need a little help."

We judge and judge people  because we think we know them from what we see. False  we just know their outsides. Many of you don’t know I have a sister  but I do - an older one too. She’s been facing demons ever since the 6th grade. It sucks. Trust me  it’s now like I have to play the role of the older sister. Right now  I can’t - I just can’t hold it together anymore.Just this Thanksgiving  I almost lost a sister to these demons fueled by society. She was involved in a car accident where she was harassed and taken advantage of - it wasn’t her fault. With the ongoing pressure and lawsuit accusations  my sister fell into a spiral and gave up. This giving up doesn’t mean kicking a rock on the floor and sighing  “Urgh  I give up.” She gave up. We’re now currently facing a huge medical bill  for her being in the ICU  that we can’t take care of.We kindly appreciate any donations. Amy is still in recovery right now. She has a long  bright journey ahead. Any donations and support helps! Remember  always be kind to another because you don’t know what that person has gone through or is going through.

While she thought she had an inflammation in her throat from a cold a few months prior  it turned out to be a malignant growth in her throat. The growth was removed in Ukraine  and that is how a diagnosis was obtained. In an effort to fight for her life  she thought that returning to the United States for treatment  where her husband and daughters reside  was her best option. However so far  it is not turning out to be so. Alina does not have health insurance  and she has been turned down for immediate treatment here in the US. The Financial Assistance program that may potentially become available to her is a very long and drawn out process  and Alina needs treatment now. The growth in her throat has been removed in Ukraine back in the beginning of October  and she was told she needed to start treatment within 4-6 weeks after the removal. It has now been over 6 weeks  and the next available appointment for her scan without health insurance is not until the end of December. Alina absolutely cannot afford to wait that long! Her life literally depends on starting the treatment of this very aggressive form of cancer. We are desperately trying to fundraise  so she can start the medical treatment she needs now as she is not able to wait for the financial assistance to kick in. I urge you to not just pass this by  as every donation  even if it is $1  whatever the amount may be  collectively will make a huge difference. Alina’s husband is struggling to provide for their family of 4  and their oldest daughter is currently unable to work as she is helping with their youngest daughter while Alina undergoes several appointments  labs and tests.This is a very heartbreaking situation  but the beauty and hope here is that we can all help. Not all of us can donate a lot  but it is in the numbers of us is where it will make a difference. Please donate $1  $3 or $5 if that is all you can do. When many of us come together  we can help greatly. This is a season of giving  please remember Alina  and how much she will benefit from every donation. Thank you so much  we truly appreciate you and your help. God Bless"

It takes a special kind of person to deal with the little ones day in and day out but she loves the babies that are in her care and loves spending each day with them. She is a very compassionate  loving  thoughtful woman and she is my heart and soul. In January of this year Dawn was diagnosed with pneumonia. During this time she saw the doctor on 5 different visits and was prescribed an assortment of medications to combat her sickness. After the numerous medications the doctor was finally able to find a combination to heal her pneumonia. We are just beginning to see the medical bills come in for her pneumonia treatment and there seems to be no end in sight. Like many people in our country  Dawn has no insurance and is unable to afford any health insurance plans that provide the coverage that she needs. Since overcoming pneumonia  she developed a condition with her heart. Her primary care physician  through numerous attempts  was able to find a cardiologist that would see her without insurance. We met with the financial advisor today at the cardiologist's office and was able to pay for today's visit which was basically a consultation to lead to tests. She is currently wearing a 24 hour heart monitor to start with  however  she is going to need further testing which we don't have the means to cover. She is unable to work currently and don't know when she will be able to go back. I work full-time and pickup odd jobs on the side when I can.  Dawn and I both come from families that would rather starve than ask for help from anyone  I guess you would call us both full of pride. Please consider making a small donation to help financially with the cardiac tests that she desperately needs. Thank you to each and every one of you all!Frederick"

Since then  while in job search mode  I've managed to hang on financially with limited funds from severance   unemployment  401k funds and finally  early filing of social security benefits. I've also received help from dear friends who keep me in their prayers  loan me supplies  equipment and money knowing there is no certain date of repayment but continue to believe in me when I don't think I can stand another second of insecurity and fear. It's a cliche but true regatdless;Looking for job is a full time job all by itself. Keeping yourself pumped up and positive isn't easy when there seems to be no end in sight to the struggle. So  I'm taking a couple of deep  cleansing breaths and keeping  at the search. Since I don't yet qualify for Medicare  I have continued my health coverage through COBRA. Because of preexisting conditions and my age  I  am hoping this Go Fund Me account will help me to collect enough money to pay my remaining COBRA premiums. I have been able to manage until now with savings and funds as previously described. Now though  I'm falling short $1000/month  for RX copays and my COBRA health premiumCollecting $6 000 to cover premiums  copays and RX expenses combined with SS benefits will keep me current with monthly expenses (as long as the doggies stay heathly and the 15 yr old car keeps going...) for at least 6 more months. I'm determined to have this resolved before that deadline!Unfortunately  my age places me in a difficult position for the market health coverage and COBRA continuation (as expensive as it is) is cheaper than anything I can buy on the Georgia open market (but I keep looking).Through much agonizing tinged with some shame at even being in such a situation   I'm asking for your help through this Go Fund Me campaign. Let me be very clear that I do know how difficult things are for many of you and I certainly don't want to be another hardship for you. And  if you know me at all  you know how I hate asking for help ... sometimes to a fault.  As my resources are now precariously low  my fears of my future can be incapacitating. I'm sure you all know how this feels from struggles of your own.If you are able to help me out with this COBRA health premium expense funding campaign  my appreciation would be immeasurable. If you are not able to help financially at this time  your prayers and good thoughts and wishes are equally needed and appreciated.Thank you for thinking of me. I wish you and your family the very best for 2019 and beyond. I think 2019 will be a banner year for all of us. Let me know when things start improving on your end of the planet.Much love  Fran"

I had these receipts in my pocket and was so out of it I required assistance from the pharmacy clerk to even do a minor task  use a debit card.  I sat in the vehicle for a short spell and proceeded to return into the store to get the remainder of a grocery list I had for my mother.  I am not sure if I was headed back into the store or coming out  but I was detained  but not arrested or charged with a crime  by a local Eden City Police officer.  I do not know the officers name or badge number.  I am in fear of more repercussions if I attempt to go to the Eden City Police and get the report.  Every time I see a police vehicle  I have some kind of panic attack or something.  I have fear of reprisal because I have decided to raise my voice against these types of actions.   From my understanding of the situation they believed I was under the influence of something.  I was violently restrained and placed into the back of a police vehicle  and all of this was happening while I was having a serious medical attack.  To the best of my recollection  the police officer got the head of Wal-Mart security to come out and tell me that I was banned from the establishment and if I returned  I would be arrested for criminal trespassing.  Keep in mind that my head was banged all around while I am under medical duress.  It seemed like quite a while before the officer actually returned to the vehicle.  I remember specifically trying to explain to them that I was not under the influence and that something was seriously wrong.  I also vividly remember leaving in the police vehicle and being thrown all over the backseat and hitting my head more than a few times and the officer laughing about this.  I was never charged with a crime nor arrested for anything.  That is the last clear memory I have until a couple of days later.  I ended up at UNC Rockingham Health Care hospital.  They say that I went into a deep coma and ended up being placed on some kind of life support once they got in touch with my mother.  The doctor there was in direct communication with a neurologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.  They did all types of screening and figured out that I was not under the influence of anything.  All of my drug and alcohol tests came back negative.  UNC Rockingham had previously seen me for having one of these types of seizures a couple of weeks before this.  I do not remember any of this.  My mother came into the emergency room and talked with the doctor but they could not figure anything out.  My mother got what possessions I had on me  which two things were missing.  I was air-lifted to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center by helicopter.  I spent three days in the ICU center there after got me semi-awake.  I was kept in a locked down ward because I had a lot of serious confusion.  I did not even know simple things such as the year or the president.  I also did not know certain family members.  I was eventually relocated into a regular patient room.  It is not until this point that I have any resemblance of a memory.  Once I was stabilized and had enough seizure medication in my system  I was released from Wake Forest January 8  2019.  My head or my brain  still is nowhere close to being normal.   I do not have any kind of health insurance  and now I have astronomical hospital bills that haven’t even started coming in yet.  I have no idea how I can possibly pay these bills that could have been avoided.  On January 10  2019 I was at home and sometime around 4 PM I had some type of seizure.  My mother came into my bedroom and found me trying to get up out of the floor.  I was not able to respond to basic conversation.  I do not remember anything about that day until around 11:30 PM or so.  I woke up and was in my bed and I knew something was not quite right with me.  I went to wake my mother up to take me to UNC Rockingham hospital.  As I was waking her up  I went into some type of grand mal seizure.  To the best of my knowledge I have never had one of this type before.  There is no explanation for the increase in frequency or severity of my seizures.  I have gone for years without having one to having multiple in a day and more severe.  They have given me a higher dose of medication and so far  there have not any other seizures   I still am nowhere close to the person I was before. This entire situation could have been avoided if the officer would have just looked at the paper I have in my wallet.  It is wrapped around my ID and in huge highlighted letters it states that I have a seizure disorder as well as the list of medications I take  none of which are narcotic nor impairing.  Now I have applied for every kind of aid possible  but none will be completed in time for me to see the neurologist on February 12  2019.   They are expecting a payment of $210 before they will even see me.  I defimiately need this appointment because of the increse in frequency and fogginess in my brain.  I am also going to have to get medications which I have no idea of the cost of.  Without health insurance its hard."

When a person has two or more unprovoked seizures  they are considered to have epilepsy. A seizure happens when a brief  strong surge of electrical activity affects part or all of the brain. Cerebral palsy is the most common motor and movement disability. It is a neurological disorder that affects a child's motor skills  movements  and muscle tone. Cerebral palsy is caused by brain damage that develops while the baby is still in utero  during labor and delivery  or shortly after birth.As a parent of a child with Cerebral Palsy  the feeling of uncertainty has no bound  but it is even more amplified when seizures are added to the mix. Lailani's seizures vary in duration  intensity  frequency  physical presentation  and controllability. For Lailani  dealing with her seizures can feel like a roller coaster. Luckily  recent advances in seizure prevention and treatment have made seizures less scary than they used to be. Years ago Lailani had undergone a procedure to surgically implant a device known as a Baclofen Pump into her abdomen to help manage her violent muscle spasms associate to her Cerebral Palsy. The baclofen pump system consists of a pump and a catheter that brings the medication from the pump into the spinal fluid. The pump is a round metallic disc (about 1 inch thick and 3 inches in diameter)  which is surgically implanted under the skin of the abdomen. The pump contains a battery  which usually lasts between five to seven years  a reservoir for the medication  and a microprocessor.Unfortunately  the device is beginning to fail sooner than expected  and as a result  her muscle spasms are becoming more frequent and violent. The stress her body goes through during these spasms at times causes her to experience unpredictable seizures. This device needs to be replaced as soon as possible to prevent further harm. We hope to have her surgery this summer  but it may have to be sooner than that. This device has genuinely been a benefit to her life and has allowed her to have a more independent lifestyle. I am 54 years old working three jobs to save enough money to pay for the portion of the procedure my health insurance will not cover. I come to you all with a heavy heart and only ask of you to give what you can and help Lailani. We thank you all for your time and support.Bless you All"

Lots of work is being done  but there's a lack of payments coming in for said work. This has resulted in a struggle to pay for basic things  from utilities bills and groceries  to major things like health insurance.

"Medical","December 7, 2018","Health Insurance for 2019","$155","$3,600","6","4","6","49","ELGIN","SC","My story is somewhat of a long one so here it goes.I am chronically ill. I was diagnosed with Depression at 14  Generalized Anxiety Disorder at 16  Panic Disorder at 17  PTSD at 18  and Bipolar I Disorder at 21. In order to treat these disorders I need to take medication  go to monthly doctor visits  psychotherapy  and occasional hospitalization. Because all of these treatments require money  I have to have a good health insurance plan in order to afford them all. In the past I have been able to have great coverage for as little as $23 a month thanks to a $300 subsidy given to me by the ACA. On May 29th of 2018 I married a wonderful  former Marine. This means in 2019 I am going to lose most of my subsidy. This is because Jacob is offered insurance through his job. Because Jacob is a veteran  he can receive health care through the VA and does not need regular insurance coverage. However  his job requires that we both be on the plan if we get insurance through them. The premium through them is $455 and does not cover my expenses nearly as well as we need it to. I do not get any benefits from the US Military as we married after he was honorably discharged.So I opted to go through Marketplace (ACA) to see what plan I could do in order to be able to afford my medications. I currently take eight medications - seven of which have generic forms and are only Tier 1 level medicines. They cost the least and are covered by even the most basic plans. The eighth medication is on Tier 2 and is called Latuda. It is an anti-psychotic that does not have a generic form. I have been taking this medication since 2014 and it has helped me greatly with my Bipolar Disorder. It doesn't cause me to gain weight and is even safe to take while pregnant if I were to become so. Latuda is roughly $1600 for a 30 day supply. With my current plan I pay $11. The lower level insurance plans do NOT cover this medication and I would have to pay the full amount in order to get it. In order to continue to take this extremely effective medication  I need at least a Silver level plan which are more expensive. I chose the cheapest of the Silver level plans in order to get the coverage I need. I do qualify for a $117 dollar subsidy  however I would still need to pay $343 out of pocket each month to cover my premium. This does not include costs of treatments each month. Because of my disability  I can only work part-time. I do not qualify for health insurance through my job. This is my only option if I want to be covered next year. I have tried other medications but none have been as effective at Latuda. In order to maintain my mental health  I need to continue to take this medication. I set the goal for $3 600 to cover $300 a month for next year. Any additional raised will go towards medical bills (copays  medication costs  etc).

But Angel's life is anything but ordinary.  Three years ago  Angel was diagnosed with Hereditary-Spastic-Paraplegia. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)  also called familial spastic paraparesis (FSP)  refers to a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity (stiffness) of the legs. Angel's symptoms started to present in her early 20s.Early in the disease course  there may be mild gait difficulties and stiffness. These symptoms typically slowly progress so that eventually individuals with HSP may require the assistance of a cane  walker  or wheelchair. Angel now has as her constant companion  her pink wheelchair  Penelope.Though the primary features of HSP are progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness  complicated forms may be accompanied by other symptoms. Angel is also plagued by ataxia (lack of muscle coordination) and epilepsy. She is in near constant pain and recently underwent surgery to have a pump implanted to distribute medication to help control her muscle spasms. There are no specific treatments to prevent  slow or reverse HSP.Even while dealing with these issues  Angel maintains the attitude that she is not \"disabled\".  She has continued to work in order to pay for medical insurance and additional expenses not covered by insurance.  Her resilience is inspiring.Recently  Angel was dealt a set-back when she was laid-off from her job.  She had hoped the lay-off would be temporary  but unfortunately that may not be the case.This GoFundMe account is being set-up to help Angel cover the cost of her medical insurance and to help raise funds for a new wheelchair (which she will require soon).Thank you for taking the time to read this.  And thank you in advance for donating to this worthwhile cause.  If you would like to learn more about HSP or donate to HSP research  please visit  www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorder/Hereditary-Spastic-Paraplegia-Information-Page."

For the last two years she has been in a lot of pain in her knee  causing her to walk very slowly and to not walk straight. Doctors gave her many injections into the knee thinking it would help  as she can not afford a knee replacement. As her pain was getting worse over the year  a different doctor did some tests and MRIs and noticed that she has a bad disk extrusion in her spine. He has informed her that she immediately has to go into surgery as any wrong movement can paralyze her.  As this is a very difficult surgery and does not allow for any mistakes  as it could paralyze her  it is recommended to go to a well-known surgeon in the United States. She has to come up with $35 000 to cover the surgery and has to do it as soon as possible.

I had no idea what was happening. We immediately called 911 for help. She was suffocating with her own vomit. I immediately began CPR on my wife. The paramedics arrived on the scene. They took her to the local hospital  but unfortunately they could do nothing as her situation was very serious & they determined she would not survive. They had her airlifted & transported to Seattle  WA. Once  we arrived in Seattle  they immediately took my wife to surgery. After the surgery  the doctor explained that my wife had an intracerebral hemorrhage. Her blood pressure was over 200. The doctor explained that this was bleeding on the brain & the next 48 hours were very critical. He explained that most people do not survive this even with surgery. He explained that I needed to prepare for the worst & prepare our children as well. In the next 48 hours  my wife was on a ventilator  which was breathing for her. She showed no change. They had left part of her skull open from the surgery to monitor the swelling of the brain as well as the bleeding in her brain. After 48 hours  the doctors asked me to sign the papers to remove my wife from the ventilator  stating that nothing else could be done. I did not believe this because my wife is a fighter. We have children & grandchildren. I was not ready to let my wife go. The next morning I met with another doctor  who immediately took my wife to another surgery on her throat & later on her stomach. Later that evening  my wife regained consciousness. However  she only has opened her eyes & moved her hands a little. She has had the ventilator from her mouth removed  but the opening on her skull is still there. They have performed 4 surgeries at this time. I work in the apple orchards in WA. We do not have health insurance & I’m very concerned for the amount of the medical bills & how I will pay for them. I am the sole provider for our family. I lost my job due to being in the hospital with my wife. So now there is no income as well as no insurance.

El 4 de diciembre de 2018  mi esposa  Karla  de repente cayó al suelo. No tenía idea de lo que estaba pasando. Inmediatamente llamamos al 911 para pedir ayuda. Se estaba asfixiando con su propio vómito. Inmediatamente comencé RCP en mi esposa. Los paramédicos llegaron a la escena. La llevaron al hospital local  pero desafortunadamente no pudieron hacer nada ya que su situación era muy seria y determinaron que no sobreviviría. La llevaron en avión y la transportaron a Seattle  WA. Una vez que llegamos a Seattle  inmediatamente llevaron a mi esposa a la cirugía. Después de la cirugía  el médico explicó que mi esposa tenía una hemorragia intracerebral. Su presión arterial estaba por encima de 200. El médico le explicó que esto estaba sangrando en el cerebro y que las siguientes 48 horas eran muy críticas. Explicó que la mayoría de las personas no sobreviven incluso con cirugía. Explicó que necesitaba prepararme para lo peor y preparar a nuestros hijos también. En las próximas 48 horas  mi esposa estaba en un ventilador  que respiraba por ella. Ella no mostró ningún cambio. Habían dejado parte de su cráneo abierto de la cirugía para controlar la inflamación del cerebro  así como el sangrado en su cerebro. Después de 48 horas  los médicos me pidieron que firmara los papeles para retirar a mi esposa del ventilador  indicando que no se podía hacer nada más. No creí esto porque mi esposa es una luchadora. Tenemos hijos y nietos. No estaba listo para dejar ir a mi esposa. A la mañana siguiente  me encontré con otro médico  quien de inmediato llevó a mi esposa a otra cirugía en su garganta y luego en su estómago. Más tarde esa noche  mi esposa recuperó la conciencia. Sin embargo  solo ha abierto los ojos y ha movido un poco las manos. Le han quitado el ventilador de la boca  pero la abertura de su cráneo todavía está allí. Han realizado 4 cirugías en este momento. Yo trabajo en los huertos de manzanas en WA. No tenemos seguro de salud y estoy muy preocupado por el monto de las facturas médicas y cómo las pagaré. Soy el único proveedor de nuestra familia. Perdí mi trabajo por estar en el hospital con mi esposa. Así que ahora no hay ingresos ni seguro. Tengo fe en que todo saldrá bien  pero también pregunto si alguien puede ayudar  por favor  háganlo. Sé que los tiempos son muy difíciles para todos y cada persona tiene su propia historia y situación. Sin embargo  si hay alguna forma de donar $ 5  $ 10  $ 20 o lo que sea  mi familia agradecería enormemente su ayuda en este asunto.

I was receiving medical benefits through that job  but they ended when I left. I took a job that made me happier but paid much less  and didn’t include benefits. When I applied for Medicaid  I was denied for making an average of $60 too much per month  and when I sent in a 24-page appeal  I was denied for not having severe enough health problems.My medical probs: I have lupus (an autoimmune disorder) that has caused severe kidney damage  including causing kidney failure/hospitalization in the past. I suffer from high blood pressure and skin issues  also as a consequence of lupus. I should be on meds for all of that (especially for my blood pressure)  but I haven’t been on in them in months and it’s taking a physical toll. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression  but I’m off of those antidepressants now as well. To boot  my wisdom teeth have been coming in since summer and cause me daily headaches that I’m treating with a lot of over-the-counter meds  and several days ago I started spontaneously losing sight in my left eye. *insert shrug emoji here* But I can’t afford to see an ophthalmologist without insurance  so I’m waiting until January and just…. Hoping for the best?I started a new job a few days ago  which will provide me more money in general AND health benefits starting in March  but before then I desperately need to see some doctors and address my sight and blood pressure issues (at least!). I enrolled in the ACA so I can have coverage in two short weeks  but I have to pay a $324 premium by the 1st of January in order to keep it.Because I’m changing jobs right now  money was already going to be tight between December and January  and now it’s going to be a lot tighter. I won’t have my first regular paycheck from my new job until the January 12th of the new year.I know it’s the holidays and pretty much everyone is strapped for cash; I know  too  that I’m not the only one asking for help right now.

It is the law that adults who were formerly in foster care are entitled to and eligible for medicaid until age 26:  \"In addition to allowing young adults to remain on their parents insurance until age 26  the ACA allows for former foster youth to remain eligible for medicaid until 26 as well without regard to income.\"I was fed this sentence a hundred times over while I was in care  and repeatedly after. I did nothing to trigger a stop or tick in the system to make me ineligible (it is virtually impossible until I am 26 to be ineligible).I have gone to fix this at county/state office buildings to no avail. My husband and I recently became pregnant as we'd planned because I was sure that I was covered by Medicaid and would be safe and stable to get through all of the (very numerous) OBGYN and primary care visits.We are planning on taking legal action  because whoever made this mistake has fully broken a law and is hiding behind their pride & doesn't want/know how to correct it. But as we all know  babies don't wait for court cases to get over to grow.I have still not seen a sonogram of my baby  nor have I had my first real OBGYN appointment because of the error in my health insurance. My husband and I are saving money to get a new apartment to make room for the baby and we are moving in July. We have little to no extra money to spend and any donations will be put toward a monthly premium so that I can afford insurance that is (unfortunately) not medicaid.I appreciate you so much for reading and donating."

The last 2 treatments  I was changing jobs and my new insurance didn’t kick in for 90 days. Staff at my eye doctors kindly convinced me that these treatments are necessary so my vision doesn’t worsen. I was terrified of not being able to see well enough to perform my job duties working with the disabled. I went ahead with self pay because it was $250 an injection. I was on a payment plan. As it turned out  my 5 prior eye injections were not fully covered by my former insurance even though I paid the copayments. Now I owe what the insurance didn’t pay plus the 2 self pay injections. I went to get an eye exam to see how well the treatments were working and they discovered I now have the beginning stages of glaucoma. When leaving  they made 2 appointments  one for yet another injection and one for the glaucoma. I received a phone call from the eye doctors office later and was told they will not treat my eyes until I pay the full amount which is a little over $800. Within only 3 months of our agreement  I have not been able to pay and the payment plan has been void  according to them. Training with a new company to work with the disabled starts soon and that insurance won’t kick in for 90 days as well. Unfortunately I do not have $800 to pay the eye doctor but I know my treatments for the macular edema and glaucoma must be treated. I’ve never asked for help through go fund me for myself but because these treatments will help support my livelihood and daily life. There are no family members for me to ask so I am asking you. Anything put forth for this would be immensely appreciated. Whichever way this turns out  my faith and love for God will be just as strong! Thank you and God bless!"

It was manageable for some time but situations arose that no longer allowed me to be able to pay. All the while  I am in and out of the hospital dealing with an aggressive case of pneumonia and severe anxiety attacks due to not having my medications.By the time the new year hit  I owed $1000 in health insurance premiums and I have no insurance until it is paid in full.

She has been doing radiation  constantly in and out the hospital  which has taken a major tole on  her body. She hasn't been able to work as much because of her condition but still tries to find strength in her weaknesses.  I have began to see how hard it is for her to do simple tasks sometimes   but even through that  she is truly a fighter.Just recently  she has been falling quite often and has suffered a broken ankle as well as getting into a car accident about a month ago.On top of her not being able to work she also does not have medical insurance and has had a hard time paying for her bills. With her recent car accident  the hospital she attended (not even over night) has added extra charges to her bill  that she cannot pay off. Even though I know my grandmother is heartbroken about the matter  she still tries to be strong and wear a smile on her face.Arlene is always a giver and has a heart for those around her. Even when she doesn't have much money  she would give her last to someone in need. She's always stopping and making sure whoever she sees in distress  is okay at the moment. She truly puts others before herselfI am a college student and trying my absolute best to support her and help her as much as I can  even if it's not a lot.

He was rushed directly into surgery upon being brought to the trauma center of John Muir Hospital in nearby Walnut Creek. Tim had sustained severe head trauma when he fell  and doctors needed to act quickly to reduce the swelling and bleeding in his brain  removing a piece of his skull in the process. He spent the next 3 weeks in the ICU on life support  with a breathing machine  constant IV fluids  and intubated feeding while his doctors worked to keep him alive and bring him back to consciousness. Mom (Debbie) and Dad (Frank) flew out to be with him immediately  who were quickly followed by brothers Andy  Jeff  and Jonathan  and girlfriend Natalie. Tim has been moved several times since to Kentfield Hospital for rehabilitative care and treatment  and back to John Muir  where surgeons have replaced the piece of his skull that was removed.  He is now in Acute Rehab at John Muir.It has been a difficult road for Tim. With the damage he received to his brain in the fall  he awoke with only limited control of the muscles in his left side  and no ability to move his right side at all. Communication is a significant challenge as his speech center in the temporal lobe was damaged  but doctors believe that he can regain some of this in time  with daily therapy to redevelop and train the neural pathways from his brain to the rest of his body.He has seen great progress and wonderful care under the watchful eye of his doctors and therapists  and has even begun to regain his comprehension and the use of his right arm and leg! Mom and Dad have never left his side during this time  taking time away from home and work to protect one of the most valuable things in their lives; Dad even having to resign from his job to be there for Tim. While his doctors and family work to provide the very best care for Tim  the road ahead will be very long  and very difficult...To date  the costs for John Muir are an upwards of $2 162 000  not including the $35 000 bill from Kentfield - much of this will be covered by insurance  but not all  and Mom and Dad's temporary relocation/living expenses in California for the last few months have been a factor. We do not have an estimate for the anticipated expenses of Tim's ongoing care but his co-pays and deductibles will exceed $10 000   and he is in need of handicap accessible items (ie. wheelchair)  adaptive equipment  and home modifications that are not covered by insurance.Tim will be leaving CA (sometime in December) to continue therapy in Boston  which will continue for months. With no ability to work  he will have no income  depending on support from family for ongoing expenses  including increased health insurance costs and everyday living expenses  as he continues on his long road to recovery.We now need your help to get through this difficult time. His progress is encouraging  but he will have a great deal of work to do before he can get back to the Tim Butterworth that everyone knows and loves. Still a talented musician and performer  we know that he will still be able to bring people smiles  but he will need your help to get there. Please help us to help Tim bring music to the world again!"

Ray ported Python so that it could be cross-compiled using MinGW-w64/GCC to be hosted on Windows  built on GNU/Linux as part of a complete toolchain build for final embedding into GDB. This was a requirement for Qt Creator debuggers to work correctly.  He then released his own version of the Google Android NDK using the above GDB/Python work. These were the first NDK toolchains released to run natively on Windows (rather than being Cygwin based)  to support ARM Neon and to be based on the Linaro Android GCC sources. Subsequently this work  including the Python port was merged to Google's upstream Android source code repositories.  Ray co-founded the MSYS2 project. The project ported ArchLinux's Pacman to Windows and maintains 'PKGBUILD' recipes and patches for more than 1000 Open Source software packages. MSYS2 is now the recommended upstream or build environment for many Open Source projects  Git for Windows  Rust  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler  Gnome and KiCad among them.   Since joining Anaconda  Inc. in February 2016  Ray has done a huge amount of work to propel the Anaconda Distribution forward.  Most notably  he was responsible for the great leap forward in our compilers with the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release. In case you missed it  this blog post  highlighted the performance and security improvements.  Ray managed to wear out his keyboard from the amount of effort he put into the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release! Ray is responsible for the development of the R and MRO conda packages.  He is also the one the Anaconda Distribution team relies on whenever it comes to tricky compiler issues.  On many occasions  he has tracked a tricky bug into assembly code and fixed it. He has made numerous patches to address CVE vulnerabilities.  He has managed to jump through crazy hoops at times to ensure that the Anaconda Distribution remains compatible with the widest range of systems and hardware. Whatever the challenge  he has remained a critical member of the team who supports his fellow teammates.  In spite of his remarkable ability and contributions  Ray is very humble  hardworking and affable.  Despite his daunting condition  he remains upbeat and incredibly dedicated to continuing his work and open-source contributions.  Ray has undergone treatment in the UK since his diagnosis in March.  Unfortunately  the doctors there believed operating on Ray’s tumors would be too risky to attempt.  Ray obtained a second opinion at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  TX  where they believe surgery is both possible and advisable.  Here’s the catch: with immigration laws and health insurance policies  we can’t get Ray covered for his operation to happen at M.D. Anderson.  To give Ray the best chance at surviving this  we want to pitch in and help him obtain the best care possible.Since he has given so much to the Anaconda community and the broader open source community - we want to give others the opportunity to help him as well.  In recognition of Ray’s vast contributions to our community  and in the hopes of helping him beat cancer  please join us in contributing towards his treatment.  Contributions here will be matched 1:1 up to $50 000 by Anaconda  Inc.  Ray has an immediate need for funds leading to surgery in the beginning of December  and will have an ongoing need for continuing treatment afterwards."

The sound of his grandma singing to him  the feeling of the sun on his face  eating sweet ripe bananas  listening to his mama reading him stories  and going for daily walks in the fresh air with his daddy. Soon  a terrible disease will cause him to lose the ability to eat by mouth  to smile and to laugh  to see  to hear  and to move his little body.Our precious boy has been diagnosed with a rare terminal brain disease called Krabbe disease  a type of leukodystrophy. Krabbe is an inherited genetic disease. Children with this disease can’t create enough of a substance called galactosylceramidase  which is needed to make myelin. Myelin is the material your body uses to surround and protect nerve fibers. Without this protection  cells in the brain will die  and the nerves in the brain and other parts of the body will not work properly. There is currently no cure for Krabbe disease. Babies with this condition have a life expectancy of 13 months.This news has been unbearable and impossible to fully comprehend. That is why I now ask for your help on behalf of my sister (Lana) and brother-in-law (Dragan).Because there is no cure for Krabbe  children with the infantile onset receive only palliative care and supportive therapy. To help keep Nikola comfortable  there are therapies and special equipment to ease his pain. Most of this is not covered by health insurance and is extremely costly. Additionally  there is only one physician in the U.S. that specializes in this rare disease. Dr. Maria Escolar (Director  Program for the Study of Neurodevelopment in Rare Disorders) is located in Pittsburg  PA. Anytime Nikola must be seen by her  Nikola’s parents have to travel from Virginia to Pennsylvania at their own cost (flights  hotel  car rental  etc.).Our goal with this campaign is to help Nikola’s family obtain necessary medical equipment to ease complications and comorbidities associated with Krabbe disease. Our other mission is to bring awareness about this terrible disease. There are only 4 states in the country that test for Krabbe on the newborn screen at birth. If treated at birth  Krabbe victims can have a significantly better outcome and live a longer life. Any additional funds we raise from this campaign will be donated to Hunter’s Hope. Hunter’s Hope Foundation addresses the acute need for information and research with respect to Krabbe Disease and related Leukodystrophies. This organization is pushing for legislation for testing as it could have saved Nikola’s life and the lives of many other babies with Krabbe Leukodystrophy.

Bryan suffers from terminal cancer  and his only hope of survival is a stem cell transplant. Bryan is not the type of guy to ask for financial help. He is “true grit” so this is very painful for him on multiple levels. They say our family are the friends we choose. Bryan is our family in so many ways. Not only is he an amazing father and grandfather  He is giving  caring  and possesses the rare character that prompted one friend to comment: “ if you were stuck in the desert at 3:00 am   Bryan is the guy you would call knowing that you could count on him to come and save you”.  He always has put himself out there for his friends  his kids  grandkids and his community. Now  he needs to count on us!Bryan was diagnosed with AML Granulocytic Sarcoma (Leukemia) in 2008. He underwent bowel surgery removing a tumor  along with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has suffered numerous side effects from those treatments. Presently he has blood cancer  “myelodysplastic syndrome” and  is in treatment at the Intermountain Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplant program. This is his only chance of survival beyond only a few years. Since April 2018 his health has declined. Because of his cancer and associated immune deficiency  he was hospitalized with Pneumonia in June  and again in September for a bowel obstruction at the site of his tumor. Since then he has been through several rounds of chemo  radiation and just completed a Bone marrow transplant on Tuesday November 13th with a life saving stem cell infusion from his (donor) son Winston. Thank God for Winston.Unfortunately just prior to his bone marrow transplant  Bryan learned from his doctors that  he also has a heart condition that may improve upon recovery.To compound an already difficult situation  and according to Bryan’s doctor in a letter dated January 26th 2018: “ It is anticipated that Mr. Morris will need an allogeneic stem cell transplant to cure him from the disease. Mr Morris will be required to remain within 30 minutes of LDS Hospital for approximately a year following the transplant for treatment  follow-up appointments and monitoring of his condition. He will need a full time caregiver and we recommend he not return to work due to the risk of infections and the immunocompromised state he will be in at that time” Bryan is 61 years of age  legal retirement age  without any prospect of having a living wage. While he continues to suffer from recovering from cancer  he has no disability insurance  but is applying for SSDI  and will hear back within the year. It still won’t be enough to  to meet his monthly living expenses. The burdens of his battles with cancer over the last decade and his divorce have left him with no financial resources to pay his medical expenses or even survive. He has no savings  he can’t spend much time around his grandkids because of his poor immune system  and his dog just died; the icing on his tragically melting cake. Bryan needs a minimum of $3800 (living expenses + health insurance premiums + out of pocket medical) per month to sustain him for the next year. This monthly amount only covers his minimum financial needs and health Insurance premiums  and DOES NOT include additional treatment: certain equipment needed for disability  possible lengthy hospital stays  medications  travel expenses (he will not be able to drive for some time) and more. Depending on how fast Bryan’s health progresses after the transplant  additional bills could add up fast.His last day of work was October 31st  2018  and for the most part has been in LDS hospital since that time. His “Cobra” Insurance that will  pay for the transplant is $1200 per month  and his insurance does not pay for all of the treatments he needs until he can meet an annual out-of-pocket cost of $4 000.Sacrificing even a little to help Bryan can provide him the much needed love  compassion  and emotional support along with the assistance  in showing him that you care.Just click the highlighted box with the words “Donate now” and 100% of your donation will be linked directly to a “Special Needs Trust” in the name of the Bryan Dinwoodey Morris Supplemental Trust with Zions Bank.

The family is very grateful for all of your financial support and prayers.  The current donated funds  and future donations will be used as needed for expenses. Tim and Jean Hoefling are well-loved residents of Louisville  CO. They are faithful Christians who served many years as missionaries and have been active members in their church community. Tim has always been a hardworking family man who has hardly known a day of ill health. Recently  he began to feel low on energy and unable to recover from what he thought was the flu. However  a few days ago he was admitted to the hospital because it was discovered that he has suffered two undiagnosed heart attacks  has a blood clot near his heart  and a systemic infection that cannot be identified. As of 3/25/19 he was air lifted to Anschutz where they have determined the best course of action is a heart transplant. The Hoeflings only have a health insurance co-op plan. The doctors will not move forward with the transplant until they are sure the money will be available to pay for it. They are looking at about $800 000. This  of course  does not include all the other medical bills and their regular monthly expenses while Tim is unable to work. This need is extremely time sensitive since the medical team is working to keep him alive until the money can be secured. Please consider giving if you can. No donation is too small and no amount of prayer is too much. UPDATE: While the situation remains urgent  and the heart transplant is currently not an option  there have been many answers to prayer. Tim's blood pressure and heart rate have stabilized and he is able to have short visits with friends and family. Many  many thanks to everyone who has been praying. Your prayers are being heard!"
"Medical","March 17, 2019","Sean Pittman Brain Cancer Battle Funds","$56,020","$50,000","521","1","536","1.9k","NEWMARKET","MD","The First Dark Clouds…Sean and Sara Pittman got married November  2012.  The couple had met at Mizuno Sporting goods in the Atlanta  GA area where they both worked. A daughter  Kylie  was born February  2014. It was a happy  normal life.When Kylie was 6 months old  after a long July 4th weekend  Sean started showing alarming symptoms. He started hearing unusual sounds and would stare blankly ahead during these episodes. Sara took him to the emergency room and waited in the parking lot in the car with little Kylie. It was the beginning of a difficult and frightening journey for them both.A CT scan and MRI showed a tumor in the left temporal lobe of his brain  the speech center. And something sounded abnormal with his heart. More medical testing was ordered. A malformed aortic heart valve (never diagnosed before) had created a life threatening emergency  a very large aneurysm in his aorta. In a day and a half  Sean was diagnosed as needing open heart surgery and surgery for a brain tumor.  The two medical crises were unrelated. Sean looked healthy. He was an ex professional baseball player for God's sake.  Why is this happening? That was July  2014.Surgery #1His open heart surgery was performed in Atlanta two months later in September. The medical bills and anxiety had barely paused when it was time for…Surgery #2Two months of recovery passed. Next up for Sean was brain surgery  an awake craniotomy  which was also done in Atlanta in November. The medical team there wanted to opt for immediate chemotherapy and radiation following surgery. The two sought a second opinion  heading to Baltimore  MD and met with the top neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins  Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa. Dr. Q  as he’s affectionately known  felt almost no tumor had been removed and pledged he could remove nearly all of it. At that time  it was believed the tumor was benign. Only a few months later it was time for…Surgery #3 (brain surgery #2)Dr. Q operated on Sean in March  2015 in Baltimore. He said he was able to remove nearly all the tumor. However  this type of tumor  an anaplastic astrocytoma  has tentacles and infiltrates the brain where it can’t be removed. Testing on the tumor showed it to be grade 3 or malignant. It was more than a tumor now. It was definitely cancer.At this time  it was decided to monitor Sean with regular MRI imaging of his brain  to watch and wait.  This period  about a year and a half  offered a respite from surgery but not from the anxiety of the medical bills and fear of what may lie ahead. Another baby was born  Kaleb  and Sara was laid off from her 13 year corporate job. Sara has tried to help contribute financially during this time with teaching preschool  dog sitting and selling essential oils. Full time work has simply not been feasible because of the cost of day care and the travel and time associated with his surgeries. Financial stresses mounted. And the tumor returned.Surgery #4 (brain surgery #3)Dr. Q had moved his medical team to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  Florida. Sean and Sara followed him there. Surgery was done in December  2017. This time there would be no watching and waiting. It was time to attack the tumor  so radiation and chemotherapy ensued. Sean was monitored with more frequent MRIs  driving the 6 hours between Atlanta and Jacksonville every two months or less. He would sleep in his car in the Mayo Clinic parking lot to save money.The most recent MRI (3/7/19) showed a return of cancer. This time it was in another part of the brain  the hippocampus  where memory is stored. The medical team at Mayo and Dr. Q are opting for a 4th brain surgery. It’s urgent  because the tumor is growing.Surgery #5 (brain surgery #4)Scheduled for March 29  2019. Dr. Q hopes to remove the entire tumor this time. The tumor will be genetically tested to determine what post operative treatment will combat it the best. The expectation is Sean will undergo a medical trial at National Institutes of Health in Bethesda MD--more travel expenses. A new chemotherapy drug is the other possibility. This war against brain cancer has no end  just a new battle to be won each time it invades again.The Crushing Cruelty of CancerThroughout the last 4.5 years  Sean and Sara have tried to remain optimistic  tried to just carry on like the dark clouds aren’t there. So far  Sean has been able to work. Sadly  even though they have health insurance  the high deductibles  the continuing cost of all the care  and the travel necessary to get the best of medical care have depleted all their life savings  including 401K funds. I am Sara’s mom and write this because I see the unbearable stress of unrelenting  difficult health news coupled with never ending anxiety over bills.Last April  Sara unexpectedly got pregnant just before Sean’s chemotherapy was to begin. It felt like a positive miracle to them. Sadly  the baby died in the first few months of pregnancy. Of course  there were more bills  including charges for the D &C necessary for Sara to return to good health. Life can be so hard. And yet  Sara and Sean are so grateful for the good health and happy kids they are raising through these most stressful days.Except for close friends and family  Sean and Sara have chosen to keep this journey  this fight for his life private. It’s time to ask those who know them and perhaps a few that don’t for financial help. The worry about his family’s finances and his family’s future  not to mention his own future  creates a difficult environment in which to concentrate on healing and hoping for Sean.

The road to recovery will likely be long and involve lots of care and rehabilitation  but Shyun is fighting hard  and we are all optimistic about his successful recovery.What Shyun NeedsSince coming to UCLA  Shyun has more or less supported himself  working multiple jobs to pay tuition and make ends meet. Shyun’s UCLA tuition includes health insurance that covers majority of his medical costs  but his continued coverage is dependent on his enrollment at UCLA.This is where this GoFundMe campaign comes in. Our goal is to keep Shyun enrolled at UCLA and to help pay for medical and living expenses not covered by insurance on his long road to recovery. To do so  Shyun's father  Jooho  will be establishing a trust in Shyun's name where all funds will be kept as he recovers. BackgroundShyun came to the US from Korea at the age of 7  and has continued to impact everyone he has met since. Each of us knows Shyun to be a caring friend  talented student  devoted athlete  adventurous traveler  proud son  and loving boyfriend.

As she pulled over to the side of the road  the pain intensified so much she thought she was having a heart attack. After being picked up by paramedics and rushed to the nearest hospital she finally found out her left lung collapsed. She had been in so much pain refusing all pain opioids. Once Drs put two and two together she had an infection in her lung they drained it and was going to resume all activities at home however old blood started piling out of the lung giving cause to further concern. With permission  my sister Ashley allowed them to perform a CT Scan on her left chest wall and were stunned at what they found. A large tumor sprouting from the rib and latched onto the lung. It’s easily every fist new moms worst nightmare.   Action had to be taken and they induced her into labor 6 weeks early giving birth to a beautiful baby boy named Mateo. He is truly her light and sunshine. We call him her miracle baby. After Mateo had to spend a few weeks in the NICU it was now Ashley’s turn to start the fight for her life.   She grew this rare and very large tumor unnoticed for so long  her team of Drs wanted to fight it aggressively. She had to spend one whole week as an inpatient receiving harsh chemicals and drugs upon many of the nasty side effects. This occurred every other week instead of being home bonding with the baby. In November 2016  they performed an extensive 15 hour surgery to remove her partial left lung and reconstructed her spine with lots of hardware. After 14 rounds of painfully long chemotherapy sessions away from her child  they deemed her cancer free. No longer were the days that she was told she couldn’t hold her son  no longer were the days being stuck inside because blood counts were so low. It was the best news she received. And she celebrated! By traveling  spending time with family but most importantly making a come back at work which was always the goal.   Sadly this was was all very short lived. In January 2018 she got the news the cancer had returned this time time in a different place. Back to the hospital she went  back on chemo. Trying radiation this time to come at it from a different angle. It is is now March 2019. Ashley is still in the hospital fighting for her life everyday. She most recently caught the flu and has been bedridden and throughout these many months of treatment as a single mom struggling to find childcare for Mateo; the one thing that keeps her pushing. As you can imagine hospital bills are through the roof. And we most recently learned that Ashley’s job terminated her without notice  literally having nothing to fall back on. Luckily she has great private health Insurance but the cost of living with a toddler adds up and our mother who has been pushing her self to work half time to be able to make it back in time by the evenings to help with bedtime routine. Our mother is an angel. With that being said  going forward with any donations would greatly and truly be appreciated. Ashley is the last person to ask for a handout which is why I can’t see her struggle anymore. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart  her brother Michael Gutierrez https://youtu.be/LSlTUvjjsMQ My Second Diagnosis  https://youtu.be/yt_t0xCvvOA Listening to OUR BODY"

He was placed in a medically induced coma and put on a respirator in an effort to stabilize his condition. He was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease. After not responding to treatment  his bodily functions became compromised and required dialysis. With teams of doctors on his case  he was transferred to two more hospitals as experts feverishly worked to diagnose his condition. He spent time at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Buffalo General Hospital. Howard’s body had trouble coming out of the coma  and was unable to open his eyes for 60 days. Presently  after multiple severe infections  & invasive procedures  he has been diagnosed with AML.  Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell)  red blood cells  or platelets.  This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It starts in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of certain bones  where new blood cells are made)  but most often it quickly moves into the blood  as well.

She went through five months and eight rounds of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  and a unilateral mastectomy. This August  after she had completed this treatment and during her reconstructive surgery  doctors found cancer in the lymph nodes along her sternum. The hospital told her there was less than a 2% chance of testing positive for cancer after receiving radiation and chemotherapy and having clear PET and CT scans. Molly thought she would finally be getting her life back  but instead  she has to start treatment all over again. Along with the emotional toll  she and her husband are facing impossible medical debt from her last round of treatment and anticipated costs for the next round. To get through this they need our help! Throughout her treatment this past year  Molly worked full-time amidst her fatigue  nausea  and pain in order to try and stay afloat financially. She even applied to and received a grant toward her medical expenses. She has health insurance as well as dental insurance. However  because of how expensive her treatment is -- she will be over $60K in debt after this next round of treatment from medical costs alone. She and her husband have negotiated rates down and set up payment plans where they can  but they are still not going to be able to make it through the next round of treatment without us. Her friends and family are making this go fund me for her to show our support. Any size donation is super appreciated  and for those who are not in a place to donate  we would love your help spreading the word about the fundraiser and/or any emotional support. Feel free to send a note of encouragement to her! She would love it. Love  Team Molly A Note from Molly: My name is Molly Palmison  I am 30 years old and have been living with breast cancer since July 2017. I am an Environmental Specialist living in San Antonio  TX with my beloved husband and our menagerie of pets.How this GoFundMe Will Help MeI don’t like asking for help. After my initial diagnosis I had a number of people encourage me to create a crowdfunding site to help pay for my treatment. It hurt my pride and I decided that Matthew and I could get through this on our own. Many of my initial procedures  including fertility preservation  my mastectomy  and radiation required payment in advance. I applied for multiple grants  but was denied by all but one. In the end  we put a lot of my treatments on credit cards and enrolled in hospital payment plans when available. All of my doctors seemed so optimistic at the beginning. I never thought that my condition would progress and I would need more care. Even with insurance  the bills just keep coming and it’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m drowning. I feel helpless enough living with a disease that could potentially kill me  but it’s terrifying to know that even if I live I’ll spend the rest of my life paying for a condition that was completely beyond my control.Having the weight of this financial burden off of my shoulders will give me the freedom to move on with my life. I plan to use any financial support I receive to help cover my current debt and pay for my upcoming procedures in 2019. Any unused funds will be donated to the iRise Above Foundation and Team Maggie For A Cure. HistoryBreast cancer has been a part of my life for as far back as I can remember. My mother was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 40 when I was 5 years old. Over the next decade my mother went in and out of remission before the disease finally took her life when she was 53. A part of me has always known that I would end up getting cancer; that it was a matter of when  not if. Even with that knowledge I was still shocked to be diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma at the age of 29  less than six weeks after getting married.How I Found ItI found the lump in my left breast while sitting at work one day. The underwire in my bra kept poking me so I went to the bathroom to readjust  and that’s when I found it. A hard little ball the size of a BB along my cleavage. I knew something was wrong but tried to stay positive and hope that it was just a benign cyst. I was lucky enough that my OB/GYN  was able to see me the following day. She didn’t have any appointments available for weeks  but knowing my family history she told me to come in anyway and she would find time to see me. She said that I had found a lump  along with another one that I hadn’t noticed before. From there  I underwent a mammogram  ultrasound  and biopsy before getting my official diagnosis. I have cancer. It took about two weeks from when I found the lump to receiving this life changing news. It was at the Baptist Breast Center where I met my Nurse Navigator and personal guardian angel  Andrea Kassem. She called me within an hour of my diagnosis and immediately started setting me up with a treatment plan. I am so thankful for her help. I don’t know where I would have even started looking for the appropriate doctors if she hadn’t been there to guide me.MastectomyThe first step of my journey was to undergo a unilateral mastectomy of my left breast to remove the visible cancer as quickly as possible to prevent further growth. During the surgery  the axillary nodes were tested for cancer and came back positive. In total  twenty-seven lymph nodes were removed from my left arm  armpit  and the left side of my chest to prevent the cancer from spreading. Unfortunately  this has left me with minor lymphedema as well as complete numbness in my upper arm and part of my torso. Based on the size of the malignant masses and the intrusion in my lymph nodes  I was diagnosed as Stage 3 and learned that I would need both chemotherapy and radiation. I spent the next six weeks healing from surgery and going through a whirlwind of tests and the process of fertility preservation before starting a regimen of dose dense chemo.Fertility PreservationChemotherapy  hormone therapy  and radiation can cause infertility and I was not ready to give up on the chance of someday being a mother. Fertility preservation starts out with a process similar to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) but instead of the eggs being fertilized and the embryos implanted back into the body  my embryos are in storage at a cryobank in Austin. I went through two weeks of giving myself hormone injections in the stomach and going for ultrasounds every other day. The physical toll was difficult  but it was nothing compared to the emotional ordeal of facing the reality that I may never conceive naturally or be able to carry a child at all. In addition to these struggles  my husband Matthew and I had to figure out to pay for the procedures. The state of Texas does not require insurance providers to cover fertility preservation  giving young women with fertility threatening diseases the choice of never having children  scraping the money together  or forgoing possibly life-saving treatment in favor of having a family. In total  the collection procedure and storage costs around $18 000  not including the cryobank storage fees. Matthew and I were lucky to receive a $1 500 grant from the Team Maggie for a Cure foundation as well as free medication from Livestrong  but we still had to pay the bulk of costs out of pocket. The main obstacle in paying for fertility preservation as a cancer patient is that you don’t have time to wait and save up. I had about six weeks between my mastectomy and starting chemotherapy so I had no choice but to wedge fertility preservation into the time I spent healing from surgery.After a rollercoaster of hormonal ups and downs  we were blessed with nine healthy embryos! We were told that six of them were “Grade-A.” I don’t know how I feel about our embryos being graded like chicken eggs  but good for us! Assuming we don’t decide to make our own baseball team  any unused embryos will be donated to stem cell research. ChemotherapyHaving seen my mother go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and all of its lovely side effects  I thought I knew what to expect. I was in no way prepared for the constant pain  nausea  neuropathy  and fatigue that I faced during that five month period. I had four rounds of dose-dense Adriamycin (A.K.A The Red Devil) and cyclophosphamide followed by four rounds of dose-dense Taxol and Cytoxan. I lost all of my hair after my second session of chemotherapy and started experiencing extreme bone pain and fatigue due to my white blood cell count rapidly dropping. As my physical state deteriorated it became a constant struggle just to get out of bed and face the day. I finished chemo almost a year ago and I’m still building my strength back. I go to physical therapy to combat the neuropathy I developed in my hands and feet during chemo and I feel like I’ve aged a decade. The steroids I was prescribed to deal with the side effects of Taxol were less than kind to my physique. Although I’m not out of the woods just yet  I can feel myself improving a little more each day. I’m regaining my energy  my confidence  and my drive to experience life to the fullest. RadiationAfter finishing chemotherapy  I went through five weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation was pretty easy after going through chemo. I did experience some fatigue and my skin is permanently discolored  but compared to what I had been through  it felt like I was finally getting back to feeling normal. Even with insurance  I will say that radiation wasn’t cheap. I finished treatment eight months ago and I’m still paying it off. The AftermathI had to wait a minimum of six months after radiation before having reconstructive surgery. It was a strange period of time for me. I was getting over the side effects of chemo and my body was still off-balance due to my previous mastectomy  but I no longer had constant appointments. My daily life was returning to normal but I was far from the same. One of the worst after-effects of chemotherapy is the effect that it has on teeth. My enamel was seriously damaged and my teeth had begun to erode around metal fillings that I had from when I was a child. I ended up getting two crowns and an urgent root canal for an abscessed tooth. It was really  really gross. I maxed out my dental insurance and ended up paying $1 200 out of pocket. I have two or three teeth on the other side of my mouth that also need work but I’m waiting for my dental insurance to rollover in January. I had quite a few cavities when I was a child  but up until recently I hadn’t had any dental issues for over a decade. This whole ordeal was a very unexpected and unwelcome surprise.ReconstructionA little over one year after having a left-side mastectomy  I underwent a prophylactic mastectomy of my right breast and full Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction  which uses skin and fat tissue from my abdomen to create new breasts. I spent several days in the hospital recovering and was unable to drive for about a month. I also developed deep vein thrombosis when a blood clot formed in the calf of my left leg. It hurt but luckily it wasn’t in a dangerous area so I just have to take blood thinners for a few months.In addition to breast reconstruction  I also had lymph node transfer surgery to replace the lymph nodes that had previously been removed from my arm and armpit. The goal of this procedure is to repair the lymphatic system and minimize the risk of lymphedema. It has been three months since surgery and I’m still healing  but overall it’s nice to have a body that’s halfway symmetrical. I will be having a follow-up surgery sometime next year to fix any imperfections resulting from the initial reconstructive surgery.It’s BackDuring the reconstructive surgery  two of the lymph nodes along my sternum were removed. Due to my previous diagnosis  they were sent for laboratory analysis and one came back positive for cancer. I was told by my surgical oncologist. He performed my original mastectomy as well as the prophylactic mastectomy I had before reconstruction. I went to his office on my lunch break for what I thought would be a fifteen post-op checkup. When he broke the news to me I felt like my reality was crumbling  crashing in on itself. My doctor hugged me while I cried and assured me that everything would be alright. I believe him. Prior to surgery I had undergone a PET scan and a CT scan  both of which showed no evidence of disease. I was completely blindsided by my new diagnosis. I thought I was done. I just want it to be over. My new diagnosis also came with a little over $8 000 in bills for the lymph node biopsy and tests that were not able to be approved with my insurance company prior to the procedure. I’ve been told that I had less than a 2% chance of still testing positive for breast cancer after going through chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It’s disappointing to say the least (more like earth shattering)  but at least I can be proactive instead of having it fester inside of me. I have faced this obstacle before and I can do it again. Because the cancer cells were found in my lymph nodes  I am still considered to have Stage 3 breast cancer. It has not metastasized and with proper treatment and self-care I may still overcome this obstacle. I will not let this slow me down. I have a life to live and i refuse to let this hold me back.Round TwoSince receiving this news I am back to my hectic schedule of appointments  scans  tests  and physical therapy along with working a full-time job. Life is crazy but it’s good to stay busy. I am now on hormone therapy that induces early menopause and will be starting radiation again next week. This time I will be having 26 rounds of localized radiation in the area where the cancer was found during my reconstruction surgery. Because this area of my chest is directly over my heart there is a chance that it could affect my cardiovascular system  but hopefully that won’t be the case. I am hoping to be done with radiation before the New Year. After radiation it is likely that I will be going on some kind of oral chemotherapy for a few years.I’m not as scared this time. I know what to expect and I know what I need to do in order to deal with radiation side effects. Oddly enough  the part I’m dreading most is having to use the lotion that I’m prescribed to keep my skin healthy during treatment. The smell of it immediately reminds me of being sick. In addition to further medical treatment  I am working toward making lifestyle changes to improve my health and help my body to heal itself as much as possible. I am transitioning to a plant based diet  exercising more  connecting more with others  and taking care of myself as much as possible. I am making my health a priority and I am determined to do whatever it takes to keep thriving."

Devastated  Greg was kept in the ER overnight then transferred to the oncology department where he was monitored for rest of the week while waiting for his brain biopsy.  The evening of November 1st  Greg had a successful biopsy procedure and the tissue was sent away for testing.  Greg recovered in ICU until he was released the following evening with seizure medication  etc. Greg was home and starting to feel like himself again until November 6th when he had his 2nd and 3rd seizure in his sleep.  Paramedics helped him out of his 3rd seizure  and Greg woke up in the ER yet again.  The week proceeding  Greg began having multiple focal seizure and confusion spells a day.  The seizures slowly went away as his medication became therapeutic.  Finally  on November 21st  the long awaited biopsy results were in; Malignant Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II - IDH mutation).  Now it’s go time.  On top of everything  Greg could be facing losing his job due to his time away which would mean losing his health insurance.  He’s attempting to go back to work to keep his health insurance  but can only do so much with the memory loss and headaches he’s experiencing.  Christy is working and taking care of Greg with the help of family and friends.  Because Greg and Christy recently moved to the Sacramento area  they haven’t been at their jobs long enough to qualify for FMLA.  Any support in anyway that you would be able to offer the Kellers while they’re going through this would be incredibly appreciated.  All donations will go towards Greg’s mounting medical care."

Some say: COBRA? I couldn’t afford THAT.) COBRA means you have insurance  but there’s a large payment due each month  compared to an employer-sponsored plan. Barry and Morry have friends and family who love them  and are working to provide the support they need as they figure out What Happens Next. The first thing we’d like to do is to make sure that their rent  COBRA and co-pays/prescriptions are covered for the next three months. That’s why we started this GoFundMe. In addition  we’re working to find out more about other means of support  and ways for them to be able to focus on getting Barry healthy again. We hope you’ll consider helping Barry and Morry keep the rent and insurance paid. Since their chosen family includes many artists and other working people who live from paycheck to paycheck  we understand if it’s not possible now. Good wishes  prayers  cards  jokes and pictures of cute animals are also gratefully accepted. We are committed to supporting our friend through this part of his journey  and look forward to updating you with good news. With much love  Team BarryKathleen Warnock  Donna Bungo  Dawn Jackson  Teresa Campbell  Karia Campbell  Michael Zegarski"

I am having another MRI next month to see if it has continued to grow. Fingers crossed that it has not. This cancer is a very long journey  but your prayers  kind words  and support have uplifted and inspired me beyond what I can put into words. Thank you from the depth of my heart... Kelly ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To everyone who has read my story  sent prayers and love  and donated to this life saving fund  I thank you from the depths of my being. My body is severely compromised by this painful cancer  but my heart has grown in gratitude and thanksgiving for all who have cared and shared in some beautiful form. Many of you I don’t even know in person  but your kindness and generosity have expanded me beyond what I could have imagined. Thank you all for being an integral  soul-moving part of my journey and giving me the experience of how profoundly I am not alone. I am humbled.Medically my battle continues. In spite of the heavy-duty drugs I am taking  my cancer appears to be further metastasizing. My cancer markers are up  and the intense pain I had before diagnosis is back. It’s a protracted journey  but I am strong. With the help of God  my medical team  and everyone who has touched my life  I absolutely trust that I will find a way to kick cancer’s butt.Thank you for sharing my story. Thank you for your continued support in any way that is right for you. Thank you for you.Blessings always… Kelly~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A friend and donor to Kelly’s GoFundMe campaign shared this post with her Friends and we’d like to share it with you!\"I am asking for a friend who is fighting a valiant fight against breast cancer and a myriad of related challenges. If you've been blessed with a little extra or are willing to give up a latte/cocktail/splurge  perhaps you will consider helping Kelly with her expenses. Think of it as a deposit in your bank of karma...and thank you. \" MY URGENT BATTLE WITH RELENTLESS INVASIVE BREAST CANCERMy name is Kelly VanEck I wish I didn’t need help right now  but I do  and my need is imminent. On May 24  2018 I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. My cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. It is relentless. Complications have resulted in my having five non-reconstructive surgeries in four months plus extensive and very expensive testing  radiation  and alternate treatments which my doctors have ordered.There is no bottom line answer for the kind of invasive breast cancer that I have. I will be in continuous treatment for at least 5 years  and complications from that treatment have already affected my body  resulting in additional surgeries. Lousy insurance  which has put me in a position to have to fight to get approval for things like diagnostic CT scans and infusions that can save my life  makes everything even more devastating. I have been turned down for essential procedures at the admitting desk of a lab or hospital because I did not have the cash. That’s almost as scary as the cancer.  Unfortunately  my husband and I find ourselves caught in the black hole between making too much money to qualify for Medicaid or any of the foundations that give assistance to cancer patients  and not making enough money to afford good insurance. The only way I could qualify would be if I quit my job which would make financial and emotional pressures worse.I must have the infusions  MRIs  and daily medication in order to live  but I am dealing with horrible insurance which will soon require another massive deductible to pay the parts it does pay. I do not have it. The uncovered expenses are overwhelming.My family and I have exhausted every financial resource we have  and yet my need for life saving treatment is far from over. Without the funds for those treatments and better health insurance I will not survive.My mom had cancer twice  so I was meticulous about staying current with medical exams. I started having pain on the left side of my chest about 2 years ago. The doctors couldn’t find any reason for it even though the pain continued and started to escalate. And then along came Hank  my rescue cat. Hank had been abused so the first many months that he lived with us were all about helping him feel safe. He became more secure  confident  and actually cuddly. He began to come up on the bed at night and snuggle with me. Shortly thereafter he started to do something odd. He would gently paw at my left breast and then simply lay his head on it and fall asleep. He never tried to sleep on any other part of my body  yet he repeated this action nightly. It took a while  before I finally had an epiphany! I had heard  but never seen  that animals can detect cancer. Suddenly I realized that I had spent months trying to talk myself out of something that I knew deep inside of me  but was too afraid to face. I went back into the medical community and said something is wrong. Please help me find what it is. They finally found it but the cancer had already metastasized. And that’s how Hank  this beautiful little gift from God  who had been cruelly used and abused in his early years  and somehow managed to live  made sure that I would have a chance to survive this rogue cancer.What’s NextMy cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. So I’m on the five year plan. My first surgery for this illness was June 8  2018. My fifth surgery was four months later on October 9  2018. I will be having infusions every month for the next 5 years along with accompanying MRIs  lab work  and other medications. Hopefully  research will create greater breakthroughs during this time.Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and being willing to share it. Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts. And  if it works for you  I thank you for your donations. All of them will go toward medical expenses. I promise you I will spend the rest of my life paying your kindness and generosity forward. I am forever grateful.This is where I was physically and energetically  this is where I have faith I will be again. #iamHOPE"
"Medical","January 12, 2019","Move Mountains For Danielle Mumm","$31,901","$150,000","220","3","219","1.3k","SEATTLE","WA","On December 26th  2018  Danielle “Danny” Mumm  a perfectly healthy 19-year-old athlete  suffered a sudden cardiac arrest in the mountains near Seattle.Danny Mumm  one of five siblings  has been an elite and passionate soccer player most of her young life. Her freshman year of college  she played soccer for Montana State Billings (MSUB) and transferred to Grand Canyon University (GCU) this year.  The very picture of health  she had never displayed any signs of a congenital weakness in her heart. On the day after Christmas  all that changed. While tubing with her family at Snoqualmie Pass  suddenly she didn't feel well and passed out in the snow. She stopped breathing and had no pulse.Miraculously  after critical minutes passed  there was a nurse that happened to be at the mountain tubing as well  who began performing CPR until ski patrol  and subsequent medics finally arrived. Once the medics arrived  they immediately \"shocked\" her with a defibrillator  but it was clear that her life was touch-and-go. She had to be shocked again on the way and once she arrived in Emergency.  After 24 hours in ICU at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue  despite everything the doctors could do  her heart and overall condition continued to worsen.  The doctors at Overlake consulted with the University of Washington Medical Center  and decided they needed to move her to UWMC and place her on a life-saving ECMO machine; a medical marvel that did the work of Danielle's heart and lungs so she could fight for her life and let her heart and major organs recover. And praise be to God  it worked! After 4 days on the ECMO machine  Danny’s cardiac and pulmonary functions gradually restored  and her life was miraculously spared. The word “miracle” is often used lightly.  But in this case  it is the only word to describe what happened.Just as incredibly  Danny shows no sign of cognitive damage. \"She is the same sweet  loving and precious Danny \" says her father  John. And although she has a long  very difficult road ahead of her  she will survive against all odds  by the Grace of our Heavenly Father.The challenges ahead on this long road to recovery will be enormous. Because Danny was without effective cardiac function for an extended period  and had to be placed on so many vascular constricting drugs to stay alive  the lack of circulation to her extremities caused considerable tissue and nerve damage.  The resulting ‘compartment syndrome in both lower legs and her left arm have required fasciotomy surgeries  the results of which will take time to fully determine. We are all praying for full circulation to return to her feet and further miraculous recovery. Danny will soon begin intensive inpatient physical therapy as she works towards a full recovery.Danny is a fighter  and despite all she’s been through  her spirits are high  her eyes shine and she continues to amaze and inspire the doctors and other health care providers with her recovery and attitude. She remains a light in the room.Her family has surrounded her with loving care. Her room is decorated with pictures  inspirational verses and well wishes from family and friends.  Tens of thousands  literally around the world have been praying for Danny. Her courage in the face of enormous trials and complications have touched so many hearts. So many have asked what they can do and how they can help.  For those that would like to make any kind of financial contributions towards the enormous medical and long term rehabilitation expenses  this GoFundMe page provides that opportunity.  The Mumm family would like to thanks everyone for their thoughts  prayers and any kind of help you would like to provide. While the Mumm family has health insurance  the costs are enormous – and the intensive life-saving care and rehabilitation comes with a big price tag.Please share this with everyone you know. Together  we can move mountains for Danny!“Truly I tell you  if anyone says to a mountain  ‘Go throw yourself into the sea ’ and does not doubt in their heart  but believes… it will be done for them.”                                                      -  Jesus Christ  Mark 11:23"

That night  their 13-year-old son  Sean Luca started complaining of a headache  and began acting in a very agitated and confused manner. He was hyperactive  and fixated on tiny details for extended periods of time. Having no idea what was going on  over the next few days  he met with neurologists  psychiatrists  and psychologists  and had a CT scan of the brain  an MRI  MRA  multiple EEGs  and lots and lots of blood work.On December 15th  Sean Luca had to be admitted to the hospital because his headaches were still so severe  and he spent 5 nights as an inpatient until his headache finally broke. He was released from hospital on medication and was generally ok for almost two weeks. Then the headaches came back.  This pattern of multi-day headaches followed by periods of breakthrough continued for a few months. At the time  he was given a diagnosis of atypical confusional migraines onset by puberty. He missed several months of school.  But Dave and Domenica knew something still wasn’t right.  He exhibited an array of symptoms which varied from day-to-day  and sometimes from minute-to-minute. These included obsessive-compulsive behavior  verbal and physical tics  anxiety attacks  irritability  mood swings  reclusive behavior  temper tantrums  immature behavior  difficulty with attention and concentration  hyperactivity  oppositional behavior  and becoming suddenly overwhelmed with different situations  completely out of the blue. Over time  his headaches began to wane in frequency  but these other symptoms were becoming more common.  The treatments he was getting didn’t seem to be working.At the beginning of June  2018--seven months after his symptoms began and after countless tests and doctor’s visits--he finally got a diagnosis: Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (“PANS”). This is still a relatively new diagnosis  and there are few experts in the country. If you would like to learn more about PANS  please watch “Brain on Fire” on Netflix.  A team in St. Petersburg  FL started to treat Sean Luca with an extended course of antibiotics and they saw some initial improvement. As a part of the treatment  he was admitted to Miami Children’s Hospital for a two-day treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”). After that treatment Sean Luca reported that he was finally feeling well.  He felt so well that he was able to go back to school in August and had an amazing first week.  He handled the back-to-school rigors with ease and resumed the activities he once loved.  Dave and Domenica thought the nightmare they had been living was over. But  just 10 short days after his symptoms disappeared  they were back.  And they haven’t gone away since.   In late August  Sean was seen by the preeminent expert on PANS  who is located in New York.   Writing about Sean Luca  that doctor recently wrote  “symptoms continue to progress and are severely affecting his life quality. This bright young boy is being affected by a condition that can be treated. In fact  without proper treatment  symptoms will continue to progress and eventually become permanent and irreversible.” The specialist ultimately recommended ongoing IVIG treatment for at least three months.  Sean Luca is currently in the process of receiving that treatment.Now that Sean Luca is doing a little better  he is more aware of his situation. And  that awareness is frankly a setback.  He is stressed about missing school.  You see  he hasn’t actually been to school since August 20th  and was recently enrolled in the Hospital Homebound program so that he can catch up on school work once he feels better.  He may or may not be able to complete eighth grade.  Every calendar update on his phone when he misses a voice lesson  an audition  or even “test prep” upsets him by reminding him what he’s missing. He cries himself to sleep most nights asking  “why me?” or “when will this go away?”  Those questions are painful for a parent to hear and gut wrenching to try to answer when you don’t have an answer.  When people ask how he’s doing  it is difficult for Dave and Domenica to answer. On the one hand  he’s doing so much better. Unfortunately  he doesn’t feel better. He still exhibits most of his PANS symptoms  and still struggles with elements of everyday functioning.  There are brief periods where Dave and Domenica see glimpses of the old Sean Luca:  a kind  funny  and empathetic kid who loves to sing and to serve his community.  Unfortunately  those times are short lived.   Doctors can’t really say when he might expect to see a return to his old self.  Their stock answer has been that “every patient is different.” They are encouraged at the forward momentum that he has experienced even though it is slow.  Sean Luca’s medical bills have amounted to more than $750 000 since this nightmare began.  And  despite the fact that IVIG is the only treatment that has worked for him  the family’s health insurance company refused to approve the treatment for him.Dave and Domenica  along with his doctors  filed a grievance against the insurance company. After a very protracted fight  the State of California  where the insurance company is based  eventually ruled in their favor.  Even taking into account the favorable ruling regarding the insurance  they will be out-of-pocket by more than $150 000 since Sean Luca’s symptoms began last year.Many of you know Dave and Domenica.  If you do  you know that they are some of the most kind  generous people there are.  What they have gone through in the past year is something that no one should have to endure.  This has been devastating to them both financially and emotionally.  Their strength has been extraordinary  but they could really use some help to overcome the financial and mental burden this has caused.  So  I ask you:  Please  if you can spare a few dollars during this season of giving  please do so.  No amount is too small but anything you can contribute would be so meaningful to Dave and Domenica.  Let’s make a difference in this beautiful family’s life."

However  on the night of January 6th  Tahia became violently ill  after which she fell into a coma on January 7th and was admitted to the ICU and put on life support. The doctors diagnosed her with brain encephalopathy  being unable to pinpoint a single specific cause for the severe reaction and subsequent internal brain injury.After consulting with the doctors  family members  and consultants from other hospitals in Bangladesh  a decision had been made that in order for Tahia to receive the best immediate care to save her life and treat her condition  she had to be taken to Bumrungrad Hospital in Thailand.

Despite everything  Tahia continues to show a tremendous amount of strength and perseverance towards her recovery with her parents and family members by her side. Currently  she is still being treated at Bumrungrad  as her parents are making plans to transfer her back to the states once she is in a stable condition to make the journey back.

He was unable to breathe on his own  his symptoms worsened  and within 24 hours he was moved to the ICU. He was placed in a medically induced coma and put on a respirator in an effort to stabilize his condition. He was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease. After not responding to treatment  his bodily functions became compromised and required dialysis. With teams of doctors on his case  he was transferred to two more hospitals as experts feverishly worked to diagnose his condition. He spent time at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Buffalo General Hospital. Howard’s body had trouble coming out of the coma  and was unable to open his eyes for 60 days. Presently  after multiple severe infections  & invasive procedures  he has been diagnosed with AML.  Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell)  red blood cells  or platelets.  This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It starts in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of certain bones  where new blood cells are made)  but most often it quickly moves into the blood  as well.

In order to determine the severity of his cancer and receive a treatment plan  he’s had to travel back to his hometown in France. As most of you may know timing is everything when it comes to cancer.Initially  Guillaume was scheduled to have his tumor removed through surgery. However  after arriving in France and seeking further medical evaluation  it was discovered that his cancer is stage 4. The 5mm tumor that was to be removed in his colon has tripled in size to 15mm and spread to his liver within just a few weeks.The new goal is to shrink the tumor as much as possible through treatment so that it can be removed without any further spreading. In order to do this  he needs to return to the United States to obtain treatment at UPenn’s oncology center.Sadly  Guillaume’s current health insurance policy offers only minimal coverage. His fight will be costly in more ways that one. Guillaume is unable to work as he’s had to relocate to France and his 2019 monthly insurance fees and deductible will be astronomical. But we can help. Any donation towards Guillaume’s treatment is truly appreciated.Please feel free to reach out to Francisca Soto  TK Kelly  Anthony Prano  David Darami  Christiana Barile  or Katie Shelburn with any questions or to find out additional ways you can help.

She went through five months and eight rounds of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  and a unilateral mastectomy. This August  after she had completed this treatment and during her reconstructive surgery  doctors found cancer in the lymph nodes along her sternum. The hospital told her there was less than a 2% chance of testing positive for cancer after receiving radiation and chemotherapy and having clear PET and CT scans. Molly thought she would finally be getting her life back  but instead  she has to start treatment all over again. Along with the emotional toll  she and her husband are facing impossible medical debt from her last round of treatment and anticipated costs for the next round. To get through this they need our help! Throughout her treatment this past year  Molly worked full-time amidst her fatigue  nausea  and pain in order to try and stay afloat financially. She even applied to and received a grant toward her medical expenses. She has health insurance as well as dental insurance. However  because of how expensive her treatment is -- she will be over $60K in debt after this next round of treatment from medical costs alone. She and her husband have negotiated rates down and set up payment plans where they can  but they are still not going to be able to make it through the next round of treatment without us. Her friends and family are making this go fund me for her to show our support. Any size donation is super appreciated  and for those who are not in a place to donate  we would love your help spreading the word about the fundraiser and/or any emotional support. Feel free to send a note of encouragement to her! She would love it. Love  Team Molly A Note from Molly: My name is Molly Palmison  I am 30 years old and have been living with breast cancer since July 2017. I am an Environmental Specialist living in San Antonio  TX with my beloved husband and our menagerie of pets.How this GoFundMe Will Help MeI don’t like asking for help. After my initial diagnosis I had a number of people encourage me to create a crowdfunding site to help pay for my treatment. It hurt my pride and I decided that Matthew and I could get through this on our own. Many of my initial procedures  including fertility preservation  my mastectomy  and radiation required payment in advance. I applied for multiple grants  but was denied by all but one. In the end  we put a lot of my treatments on credit cards and enrolled in hospital payment plans when available. All of my doctors seemed so optimistic at the beginning. I never thought that my condition would progress and I would need more care. Even with insurance  the bills just keep coming and it’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m drowning. I feel helpless enough living with a disease that could potentially kill me  but it’s terrifying to know that even if I live I’ll spend the rest of my life paying for a condition that was completely beyond my control.Having the weight of this financial burden off of my shoulders will give me the freedom to move on with my life. I plan to use any financial support I receive to help cover my current debt and pay for my upcoming procedures in 2019. Any unused funds will be donated to the iRise Above Foundation and Team Maggie For A Cure. HistoryBreast cancer has been a part of my life for as far back as I can remember. My mother was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 40 when I was 5 years old. Over the next decade my mother went in and out of remission before the disease finally took her life when she was 53. A part of me has always known that I would end up getting cancer; that it was a matter of when  not if. Even with that knowledge I was still shocked to be diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma at the age of 29  less than six weeks after getting married.How I Found ItI found the lump in my left breast while sitting at work one day. The underwire in my bra kept poking me so I went to the bathroom to readjust  and that’s when I found it. A hard little ball the size of a BB along my cleavage. I knew something was wrong but tried to stay positive and hope that it was just a benign cyst. I was lucky enough that my OB/GYN  was able to see me the following day. She didn’t have any appointments available for weeks  but knowing my family history she told me to come in anyway and she would find time to see me. She said that I had found a lump  along with another one that I hadn’t noticed before. From there  I underwent a mammogram  ultrasound  and biopsy before getting my official diagnosis. I have cancer. It took about two weeks from when I found the lump to receiving this life changing news. It was at the Baptist Breast Center where I met my Nurse Navigator and personal guardian angel  Andrea Kassem. She called me within an hour of my diagnosis and immediately started setting me up with a treatment plan. I am so thankful for her help. I don’t know where I would have even started looking for the appropriate doctors if she hadn’t been there to guide me.MastectomyThe first step of my journey was to undergo a unilateral mastectomy of my left breast to remove the visible cancer as quickly as possible to prevent further growth. During the surgery  the axillary nodes were tested for cancer and came back positive. In total  twenty-seven lymph nodes were removed from my left arm  armpit  and the left side of my chest to prevent the cancer from spreading. Unfortunately  this has left me with minor lymphedema as well as complete numbness in my upper arm and part of my torso. Based on the size of the malignant masses and the intrusion in my lymph nodes  I was diagnosed as Stage 3 and learned that I would need both chemotherapy and radiation. I spent the next six weeks healing from surgery and going through a whirlwind of tests and the process of fertility preservation before starting a regimen of dose dense chemo.Fertility PreservationChemotherapy  hormone therapy  and radiation can cause infertility and I was not ready to give up on the chance of someday being a mother. Fertility preservation starts out with a process similar to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) but instead of the eggs being fertilized and the embryos implanted back into the body  my embryos are in storage at a cryobank in Austin. I went through two weeks of giving myself hormone injections in the stomach and going for ultrasounds every other day. The physical toll was difficult  but it was nothing compared to the emotional ordeal of facing the reality that I may never conceive naturally or be able to carry a child at all. In addition to these struggles  my husband Matthew and I had to figure out to pay for the procedures. The state of Texas does not require insurance providers to cover fertility preservation  giving young women with fertility threatening diseases the choice of never having children  scraping the money together  or forgoing possibly life-saving treatment in favor of having a family. In total  the collection procedure and storage costs around $18 000  not including the cryobank storage fees. Matthew and I were lucky to receive a $1 500 grant from the Team Maggie for a Cure foundation as well as free medication from Livestrong  but we still had to pay the bulk of costs out of pocket. The main obstacle in paying for fertility preservation as a cancer patient is that you don’t have time to wait and save up. I had about six weeks between my mastectomy and starting chemotherapy so I had no choice but to wedge fertility preservation into the time I spent healing from surgery.After a rollercoaster of hormonal ups and downs  we were blessed with nine healthy embryos! We were told that six of them were “Grade-A.” I don’t know how I feel about our embryos being graded like chicken eggs  but good for us! Assuming we don’t decide to make our own baseball team  any unused embryos will be donated to stem cell research. ChemotherapyHaving seen my mother go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and all of its lovely side effects  I thought I knew what to expect. I was in no way prepared for the constant pain  nausea  neuropathy  and fatigue that I faced during that five month period. I had four rounds of dose-dense Adriamycin (A.K.A The Red Devil) and cyclophosphamide followed by four rounds of dose-dense Taxol and Cytoxan. I lost all of my hair after my second session of chemotherapy and started experiencing extreme bone pain and fatigue due to my white blood cell count rapidly dropping. As my physical state deteriorated it became a constant struggle just to get out of bed and face the day. I finished chemo almost a year ago and I’m still building my strength back. I go to physical therapy to combat the neuropathy I developed in my hands and feet during chemo and I feel like I’ve aged a decade. The steroids I was prescribed to deal with the side effects of Taxol were less than kind to my physique. Although I’m not out of the woods just yet  I can feel myself improving a little more each day. I’m regaining my energy  my confidence  and my drive to experience life to the fullest. RadiationAfter finishing chemotherapy  I went through five weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation was pretty easy after going through chemo. I did experience some fatigue and my skin is permanently discolored  but compared to what I had been through  it felt like I was finally getting back to feeling normal. Even with insurance  I will say that radiation wasn’t cheap. I finished treatment eight months ago and I’m still paying it off. The AftermathI had to wait a minimum of six months after radiation before having reconstructive surgery. It was a strange period of time for me. I was getting over the side effects of chemo and my body was still off-balance due to my previous mastectomy  but I no longer had constant appointments. My daily life was returning to normal but I was far from the same. One of the worst after-effects of chemotherapy is the effect that it has on teeth. My enamel was seriously damaged and my teeth had begun to erode around metal fillings that I had from when I was a child. I ended up getting two crowns and an urgent root canal for an abscessed tooth. It was really  really gross. I maxed out my dental insurance and ended up paying $1 200 out of pocket. I have two or three teeth on the other side of my mouth that also need work but I’m waiting for my dental insurance to rollover in January. I had quite a few cavities when I was a child  but up until recently I hadn’t had any dental issues for over a decade. This whole ordeal was a very unexpected and unwelcome surprise.ReconstructionA little over one year after having a left-side mastectomy  I underwent a prophylactic mastectomy of my right breast and full Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction  which uses skin and fat tissue from my abdomen to create new breasts. I spent several days in the hospital recovering and was unable to drive for about a month. I also developed deep vein thrombosis when a blood clot formed in the calf of my left leg. It hurt but luckily it wasn’t in a dangerous area so I just have to take blood thinners for a few months.In addition to breast reconstruction  I also had lymph node transfer surgery to replace the lymph nodes that had previously been removed from my arm and armpit. The goal of this procedure is to repair the lymphatic system and minimize the risk of lymphedema. It has been three months since surgery and I’m still healing  but overall it’s nice to have a body that’s halfway symmetrical. I will be having a follow-up surgery sometime next year to fix any imperfections resulting from the initial reconstructive surgery.It’s BackDuring the reconstructive surgery  two of the lymph nodes along my sternum were removed. Due to my previous diagnosis  they were sent for laboratory analysis and one came back positive for cancer. I was told by my surgical oncologist. He performed my original mastectomy as well as the prophylactic mastectomy I had before reconstruction. I went to his office on my lunch break for what I thought would be a fifteen post-op checkup. When he broke the news to me I felt like my reality was crumbling  crashing in on itself. My doctor hugged me while I cried and assured me that everything would be alright. I believe him. Prior to surgery I had undergone a PET scan and a CT scan  both of which showed no evidence of disease. I was completely blindsided by my new diagnosis. I thought I was done. I just want it to be over. My new diagnosis also came with a little over $8 000 in bills for the lymph node biopsy and tests that were not able to be approved with my insurance company prior to the procedure. I’ve been told that I had less than a 2% chance of still testing positive for breast cancer after going through chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It’s disappointing to say the least (more like earth shattering)  but at least I can be proactive instead of having it fester inside of me. I have faced this obstacle before and I can do it again. Because the cancer cells were found in my lymph nodes  I am still considered to have Stage 3 breast cancer. It has not metastasized and with proper treatment and self-care I may still overcome this obstacle. I will not let this slow me down. I have a life to live and i refuse to let this hold me back.Round TwoSince receiving this news I am back to my hectic schedule of appointments  scans  tests  and physical therapy along with working a full-time job. Life is crazy but it’s good to stay busy. I am now on hormone therapy that induces early menopause and will be starting radiation again next week. This time I will be having 26 rounds of localized radiation in the area where the cancer was found during my reconstruction surgery. Because this area of my chest is directly over my heart there is a chance that it could affect my cardiovascular system  but hopefully that won’t be the case. I am hoping to be done with radiation before the New Year. After radiation it is likely that I will be going on some kind of oral chemotherapy for a few years.I’m not as scared this time. I know what to expect and I know what I need to do in order to deal with radiation side effects. Oddly enough  the part I’m dreading most is having to use the lotion that I’m prescribed to keep my skin healthy during treatment. The smell of it immediately reminds me of being sick. In addition to further medical treatment  I am working toward making lifestyle changes to improve my health and help my body to heal itself as much as possible. I am transitioning to a plant based diet  exercising more  connecting more with others  and taking care of myself as much as possible. I am making my health a priority and I am determined to do whatever it takes to keep thriving."

Greg is a candidate for brain surgery to remove the tumor  then radiation and chemotherapy to follow.  He was referred to a neurosurgeon at UCSF that’s supposed to be the best of the best for this diagnosis.  He was simultaneously referred for another MRI to see how the cancer has progressed.  There are still many unanswered questions and consultations with specialists waiting to be scheduled. Everything began when Greg had a seizure out of the blue on October 27th.  His wife  Christy was able to call 911 and Greg was taken by ambulance to Sutter hospital within minutes.  Greg was coherent at the hospital but confused.  A CT scan was taken which showed a dark area in the right frontal lobe of his brain.  This called for an MRI.  After anxiously waiting for hours in the ER  the results came back confirming a mass in his brain. Devastated  Greg was kept in the ER overnight then transferred to the oncology department where he was monitored for rest of the week while waiting for his brain biopsy.  The evening of November 1st  Greg had a successful biopsy procedure and the tissue was sent away for testing.  Greg recovered in ICU until he was released the following evening with seizure medication  etc. Greg was home and starting to feel like himself again until November 6th when he had his 2nd and 3rd seizure in his sleep.  Paramedics helped him out of his 3rd seizure  and Greg woke up in the ER yet again.  The week proceeding  Greg began having multiple focal seizure and confusion spells a day.  The seizures slowly went away as his medication became therapeutic.  Finally  on November 21st  the long awaited biopsy results were in; Malignant Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II - IDH mutation).  Now it’s go time.  On top of everything  Greg could be facing losing his job due to his time away which would mean losing his health insurance.  He’s attempting to go back to work to keep his health insurance  but can only do so much with the memory loss and headaches he’s experiencing.  Christy is working and taking care of Greg with the help of family and friends.  Because Greg and Christy recently moved to the Sacramento area  they haven’t been at their jobs long enough to qualify for FMLA.  Any support in anyway that you would be able to offer the Kellers while they’re going through this would be incredibly appreciated.  All donations will go towards Greg’s mounting medical care."

On May 24  2018 I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. My cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. It is relentless. Complications have resulted in my having five non-reconstructive surgeries in four months plus extensive and very expensive testing  radiation  and alternate treatments which my doctors have ordered.There is no bottom line answer for the kind of invasive breast cancer that I have. I will be in continuous treatment for at least 5 years  and complications from that treatment have already affected my body  resulting in additional surgeries. Lousy insurance  which has put me in a position to have to fight to get approval for things like diagnostic CT scans and infusions that can save my life  makes everything even more devastating. I have been turned down for essential procedures at the admitting desk of a lab or hospital because I did not have the cash. That’s almost as scary as the cancer.  Unfortunately  my husband and I find ourselves caught in the black hole between making too much money to qualify for Medicaid or any of the foundations that give assistance to cancer patients  and not making enough money to afford good insurance. The only way I could qualify would be if I quit my job which would make financial and emotional pressures worse.I must have the infusions  MRIs  and daily medication in order to live  but I am dealing with horrible insurance which will soon require another massive deductible to pay the parts it does pay. I do not have it. The uncovered expenses are overwhelming.My family and I have exhausted every financial resource we have  and yet my need for life saving treatment is far from over. Without the funds for those treatments and better health insurance I will not survive.My mom had cancer twice  so I was meticulous about staying current with medical exams. I started having pain on the left side of my chest about 2 years ago. The doctors couldn’t find any reason for it even though the pain continued and started to escalate. And then along came Hank  my rescue cat. Hank had been abused so the first many months that he lived with us were all about helping him feel safe. He became more secure  confident  and actually cuddly. He began to come up on the bed at night and snuggle with me. Shortly thereafter he started to do something odd. He would gently paw at my left breast and then simply lay his head on it and fall asleep. He never tried to sleep on any other part of my body  yet he repeated this action nightly. It took a while  before I finally had an epiphany! I had heard  but never seen  that animals can detect cancer. Suddenly I realized that I had spent months trying to talk myself out of something that I knew deep inside of me  but was too afraid to face. I went back into the medical community and said something is wrong. Please help me find what it is. They finally found it but the cancer had already metastasized. And that’s how Hank  this beautiful little gift from God  who had been cruelly used and abused in his early years  and somehow managed to live  made sure that I would have a chance to survive this rogue cancer.What’s NextMy cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. So I’m on the five year plan. My first surgery for this illness was June 8  2018. My fifth surgery was four months later on October 9  2018. I will be having infusions every month for the next 5 years along with accompanying MRIs  lab work  and other medications. Hopefully  research will create greater breakthroughs during this time.Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and being willing to share it. Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts. And  if it works for you  I thank you for your donations. All of them will go toward medical expenses. I promise you I will spend the rest of my life paying your kindness and generosity forward. I am forever grateful.This is where I was physically and energetically  this is where I have faith I will be again. #iamHOPE"

Her freshman year of college  she played soccer for Montana State Billings (MSUB) and transferred to Grand Canyon University (GCU) this year.  The very picture of health  she had never displayed any signs of a congenital weakness in her heart. On the day after Christmas  all that changed. While tubing with her family at Snoqualmie Pass  suddenly she didn't feel well and passed out in the snow. She stopped breathing and had no pulse.Miraculously  after critical minutes passed  there was a nurse that happened to be at the mountain tubing as well  who began performing CPR until ski patrol  and subsequent medics finally arrived. Once the medics arrived  they immediately \"shocked\" her with a defibrillator  but it was clear that her life was touch-and-go. She had to be shocked again on the way and once she arrived in Emergency.  After 24 hours in ICU at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue  despite everything the doctors could do  her heart and overall condition continued to worsen.  The doctors at Overlake consulted with the University of Washington Medical Center  and decided they needed to move her to UWMC and place her on a life-saving ECMO machine; a medical marvel that did the work of Danielle's heart and lungs so she could fight for her life and let her heart and major organs recover. And praise be to God  it worked! After 4 days on the ECMO machine  Danny’s cardiac and pulmonary functions gradually restored  and her life was miraculously spared. The word “miracle” is often used lightly.  But in this case  it is the only word to describe what happened.Just as incredibly  Danny shows no sign of cognitive damage. \"She is the same sweet  loving and precious Danny \" says her father  John. And although she has a long  very difficult road ahead of her  she will survive against all odds  by the Grace of our Heavenly Father.The challenges ahead on this long road to recovery will be enormous. Because Danny was without effective cardiac function for an extended period  and had to be placed on so many vascular constricting drugs to stay alive  the lack of circulation to her extremities caused considerable tissue and nerve damage.  The resulting ‘compartment syndrome in both lower legs and her left arm have required fasciotomy surgeries  the results of which will take time to fully determine. We are all praying for full circulation to return to her feet and further miraculous recovery. Danny will soon begin intensive inpatient physical therapy as she works towards a full recovery.Danny is a fighter  and despite all she’s been through  her spirits are high  her eyes shine and she continues to amaze and inspire the doctors and other health care providers with her recovery and attitude. She remains a light in the room.Her family has surrounded her with loving care. Her room is decorated with pictures  inspirational verses and well wishes from family and friends.  Tens of thousands  literally around the world have been praying for Danny. Her courage in the face of enormous trials and complications have touched so many hearts. So many have asked what they can do and how they can help.  For those that would like to make any kind of financial contributions towards the enormous medical and long term rehabilitation expenses  this GoFundMe page provides that opportunity.  The Mumm family would like to thanks everyone for their thoughts  prayers and any kind of help you would like to provide. While the Mumm family has health insurance  the costs are enormous – and the intensive life-saving care and rehabilitation comes with a big price tag.Please share this with everyone you know. Together  we can move mountains for Danny!“Truly I tell you  if anyone says to a mountain  ‘Go throw yourself into the sea ’ and does not doubt in their heart  but believes… it will be done for them.”                                                      -  Jesus Christ  Mark 11:23"

That night  their 13-year-old son  Sean Luca started complaining of a headache  and began acting in a very agitated and confused manner. He was hyperactive  and fixated on tiny details for extended periods of time. Having no idea what was going on  over the next few days  he met with neurologists  psychiatrists  and psychologists  and had a CT scan of the brain  an MRI  MRA  multiple EEGs  and lots and lots of blood work.On December 15th  Sean Luca had to be admitted to the hospital because his headaches were still so severe  and he spent 5 nights as an inpatient until his headache finally broke. He was released from hospital on medication and was generally ok for almost two weeks. Then the headaches came back.  This pattern of multi-day headaches followed by periods of breakthrough continued for a few months. At the time  he was given a diagnosis of atypical confusional migraines onset by puberty. He missed several months of school.  But Dave and Domenica knew something still wasn’t right.  He exhibited an array of symptoms which varied from day-to-day  and sometimes from minute-to-minute. These included obsessive-compulsive behavior  verbal and physical tics  anxiety attacks  irritability  mood swings  reclusive behavior  temper tantrums  immature behavior  difficulty with attention and concentration  hyperactivity  oppositional behavior  and becoming suddenly overwhelmed with different situations  completely out of the blue. Over time  his headaches began to wane in frequency  but these other symptoms were becoming more common.  The treatments he was getting didn’t seem to be working.At the beginning of June  2018--seven months after his symptoms began and after countless tests and doctor’s visits--he finally got a diagnosis: Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (“PANS”). This is still a relatively new diagnosis  and there are few experts in the country. If you would like to learn more about PANS  please watch “Brain on Fire” on Netflix.  A team in St. Petersburg  FL started to treat Sean Luca with an extended course of antibiotics and they saw some initial improvement. As a part of the treatment  he was admitted to Miami Children’s Hospital for a two-day treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”). After that treatment Sean Luca reported that he was finally feeling well.  He felt so well that he was able to go back to school in August and had an amazing first week.  He handled the back-to-school rigors with ease and resumed the activities he once loved.  Dave and Domenica thought the nightmare they had been living was over. But  just 10 short days after his symptoms disappeared  they were back.  And they haven’t gone away since.   In late August  Sean was seen by the preeminent expert on PANS  who is located in New York.   Writing about Sean Luca  that doctor recently wrote  “symptoms continue to progress and are severely affecting his life quality. This bright young boy is being affected by a condition that can be treated. In fact  without proper treatment  symptoms will continue to progress and eventually become permanent and irreversible.” The specialist ultimately recommended ongoing IVIG treatment for at least three months.  Sean Luca is currently in the process of receiving that treatment.Now that Sean Luca is doing a little better  he is more aware of his situation. And  that awareness is frankly a setback.  He is stressed about missing school.  You see  he hasn’t actually been to school since August 20th  and was recently enrolled in the Hospital Homebound program so that he can catch up on school work once he feels better.  He may or may not be able to complete eighth grade.  Every calendar update on his phone when he misses a voice lesson  an audition  or even “test prep” upsets him by reminding him what he’s missing. He cries himself to sleep most nights asking  “why me?” or “when will this go away?”  Those questions are painful for a parent to hear and gut wrenching to try to answer when you don’t have an answer.  When people ask how he’s doing  it is difficult for Dave and Domenica to answer. On the one hand  he’s doing so much better. Unfortunately  he doesn’t feel better. He still exhibits most of his PANS symptoms  and still struggles with elements of everyday functioning.  There are brief periods where Dave and Domenica see glimpses of the old Sean Luca:  a kind  funny  and empathetic kid who loves to sing and to serve his community.  Unfortunately  those times are short lived.   Doctors can’t really say when he might expect to see a return to his old self.  Their stock answer has been that “every patient is different.” They are encouraged at the forward momentum that he has experienced even though it is slow.  Sean Luca’s medical bills have amounted to more than $750 000 since this nightmare began.  And  despite the fact that IVIG is the only treatment that has worked for him  the family’s health insurance company refused to approve the treatment for him.Dave and Domenica  along with his doctors  filed a grievance against the insurance company. After a very protracted fight  the State of California  where the insurance company is based  eventually ruled in their favor.  Even taking into account the favorable ruling regarding the insurance  they will be out-of-pocket by more than $150 000 since Sean Luca’s symptoms began last year.Many of you know Dave and Domenica.  If you do  you know that they are some of the most kind  generous people there are.  What they have gone through in the past year is something that no one should have to endure.  This has been devastating to them both financially and emotionally.  Their strength has been extraordinary  but they could really use some help to overcome the financial and mental burden this has caused.  So  I ask you:  Please  if you can spare a few dollars during this season of giving  please do so.  No amount is too small but anything you can contribute would be so meaningful to Dave and Domenica.  Let’s make a difference in this beautiful family’s life."

Although  Greg had proposed to Jacque in Ireland a few months earlier and an Autumn 2018 wedding was planned  they moved up the date to January 2018 so that Greg could be covered under Jacque's insurance. This also allowed Jacque's Dad  who was very ill  to attend his daughter's wedding.Jacque  in addition to supporting Greg  spent a lot of time trying to help her Mom and Dad during his final months in Spring 2018. Her Dad died April 2018  leaving a huge hole  and the grieving has been very heavy.Greg's treatment started at UCSF almost immediately in Jan 2018 but the cancer is very aggressive and  despite immunotherapy  the melanoma spread to his spine  lungs  and brain and is now Stage IV Melanoma. He happens to be one of the 50% of melanoma patients with a melanoma BRAF mutation and so  because immunotherapy was not working and the side effects were very difficult to handle  he was switched to BRAF-targeting medications. Greg had to stop working due to the side effects of the medications and spread of the cancer and Jacque and Greg could no longer afford rent on their apartment. They moved in with Jacque's mom  Renate  and continue to live with her now. Renate works as a Nurse Practitioner.Since diagnosis  Greg has had two Gamma Knife procedures on his brain which have helped to shrink and/or disappear most of the 26 brain cancer lesions  which is wonderful. He and Jacque love their radiation oncologist at UCSF  Dr. Raleigh. Greg  also had radiation on his spine and the cancer is now gone from this region as far as we know. The BRAF medications may be shrinking some of the cancers in other parts of his body  too  including areas on his chest wall  gallbladder  and bladder. We are hopeful that his treatment will ultimately be successful.Unfortunately  we just received word a few minutes ago that Greg has leptomeningeal disease  which is a rare spread of the cancer to his cerebrospinal fluid  the fluid covering his brain and his spinal cord.  This is causing severe nausea  vomiting and headache and he was treated in the ER yesterday for these symptoms. The radiation oncologist just recommended whole brain radiation which may happen as early as next week and carries some significant permanent cognitive side effects. Jacque is going to try to get Greg into a leptomeningeal specialist at MDAnderson in Texas. With this new news  Jacque is informing her employer this AM that she will be taking Family Medical Leave.Although insurance and prior authorizations and a million phone calls are a pain  health insurance has so far covered the majority of Greg's health care costs. It is not clear if this will be the case for MDAnderson.Will you please reach out to Jacque and Greg? Jacque  especially  would love to hear your voice  or better  a text message or FB message  and receive a virtual hug. Will you please pray for them? They are suffering greatly. Will you please support them financially if you can? The flights and AirBnB costs in SanDiego when they fly down to UCSD for doctor's appointments  especially  are very expensive. We are also hoping for a very special trip to Ireland in June so that Greg can spend time with his family there  if he is able to tolerate the travel.Thank you  in advance  for considering support and thank you especially for your prayers."

She's a doting mother and adoring grandmother. I know because she's my sister's mother-in-law and nana to my niece  Lily  and nephew  Ben  and her newest granddaughter  Hannah. She makes those around her feel better about themselves. A former nurse  caring for others is in her blood.  She toasts her late husband of 44 years  John  with a glass of Malbec at dinner. Her laugh lights up a room.  She's cool. Her friends and family call her Patti.But her life took a tragic turn in an instant on Nov. 28 while she was on her daily morning walk with her dog  Dash. Patti slipped on a patch of ice while crossing the road and fell backward  fracturing her T4 vertebra in the middle of her spinal column. She didn’t know it yet  but she had lost the use of her legs forever.Mercifully  a passerby came to her aid. Patti was taken to a local hospital near her home in Coldwater  Ontario  and later that day was airlifted to Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto  where she underwent emergency surgery. Doctors implanted a steel rod to stabilize her spinal column  but they couldn’t repair the nerves that were severed when her vertebra shattered.Spinal cord injuries are classified A to E  with A being the most severe. Patti's injury has been classified a B. She has no motor function and limited sensory function below the mid-chest. Doctors have since informed her that she is paraplegic.True to form  Patti is in good spirits. But a long road to recovery and rehabilitation lies ahead  as do myriad expenses to ensure she can move on with her life  spreading joy and love and her cool vibe to her friends and family.  Doctors plan by mid-month to relocate Patti to the Lyndhurst Centre at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute  where she will spend anywhere from six weeks to six months adjusting to her new reality. Insurance  through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan  will cover her medical expenses  but not all of the costs after her physical rehabilitation – the wheelchair she'll need  renovations to her home  retrofitting her vehicle  in-home assistance or long-term care. The Dana and Christopher Reeve Foundation estimate the first-year cost of paraplegia to be $518 000   with yearly expenses of roughly $69 000 thereafter. Please pray for Patti and consider pulling together for a woman who has meant so much to so many.THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SET UP TO ENSURE THAT PATTI HAS EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO ALL FUNDS RAISED."

As parents  we would all fight to do anything within our power to protect our children!  When we have been able to try natural alternatives  Alexa has responded well  but none of those things that would help her ( vitamin IV therapy  homeopathic treatments  acupuncture  nutritionist to name a few) are covered by insurance.  We have to pay out of pocket for these alternatives and it is very expensive  so we cannot do all that we would like to do.   There is a naturopathic doctor in our local area who has been doing some innovative treatments and we know this would benefit our daughter  but the first visit with detailed lab work is $1500.   Alexa deserves to lead the life of a 24 year old- having fun  going out with friends  having a steady job that she enjoys  the things many of us take for granted.  These alternative treatments can help her to achieve that and not being able to provide all of that is heartbreaking.We need to remove this financial stress from Alexa and our family  so we are asking for help.   Our hope is that we can  cover our current and some of our upcoming medical costs and also to give Alexa the chance to receive the other types of natural therapies she needs so there won't be a need for such frequent hospital stays.  Even with the help of her doctor  Alexa  is fighting both lung and digestive symptoms right now and I feel like we are just frozen without sufficient resources to explore other alternative treatments. We desperately want to do all we can to support her health and raising this money would provide enormous relief and hopefully a better future for my sweet girl."

In February 2019  Tamra was diagnosed with a very rare form of stage 3 cancer—called angiosarcoma of the heart. Stage 3. Rare. Angiosarcoma of the heart.Those words have pierced every single one of us. If you’re reading this  we have all had the same thoughts running through our heads:But  Tamra has an entire life ahead of her…But  Tamra is the mother to two young children who need her…But  they’re an Air Force family stationed on the other side of the world… What would you do?Up until February  the Grelck Family had been living an exciting overseas adventure thanks to the United States Air Force  where Matt is a Senior Master Sergeant currently serving as the Deputy Fire Chief at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. Tamra is a dedicated military wife and stay-at-home mother to Oliver (5) and Emerson (2). But behind the scenes  Tamra hasn’t felt good for months.  In the fall  Tamra was diagnosed with pericarditis. She has been in and out of many European hospitals  but no matter how many times the doctors drained the fluid around her heart  it returned time and time again.  An MRI taken in February indicated there was a mass on Tamra’s heart. Something was very wrong—and Tamra was in a hospital on the other side of the world.Tamra and Matt made one of the biggest decisions of their lives. After receiving approval from her doctors—and with little notice—they bought last minute airplane tickets  packed a few bags for the family  and boarded a plane holding Oliver and Emerson in their arms  destined for Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto  California. 5 649 miles away.A new chance at life—and a new life. Now in California  Tamra was rushed from the plane directly to some of the most renowned doctors in the world at Stanford University. But  the news was dire: she was diagnosed with a very rare form of stage 3 cancer called angiosarcoma  of the heart. Tamra’s medical team performed emergency heart surgery. They found the two masses that had been identified on a PET scan  but also 10 additional tumors when they opened her heart. During the surgery  surgeons physically disconnected her heart from her body to operate  keeping her alive on an artificial heart and lung machine. Her doctors had to reconstruct part of her heart. Dr. Joseph Woo and his team have literally given Tamra a chance to survive with this surgery. Of the 4 000 known cases ever of this form of cancer… well  the Google results aren’t easy to look at. But Dr. Woo’s techniques have removed all visible signs of this incredibly aggressive form of cancer and the next step in this process is tough.There is no break for Tamra to recover from open heart  heart out of body  break your ribs to access your heart surgery—she is on a race against time. The doctors have ordered 5 rounds of two types of chemotherapy over the next several months. Chemotherapy where each round consists of five  10-hour days in a row of treatment that leaves the body weak and unable to care for young children. They are cautiously hopeful that with this aggressive treatment  Tamra can beat the odds.But  while Tamra fights the battle of her life…life also goes on. Except now  in California. Expensive  Silicon Valley  California. The Grelck Family will remain near Stanford for months while Tamra undergoes an extremely aggressive chemotherapy regimen. While they are incredibly fortunate to be under the best medical care possible  they are still living away from their home and are still obligated to pay rent for their home with all utilities  a still parked-at-the-airport car  and belongings in Germany—with significant living expenses accruing in Palo Alto. Matt and Tamra are depleting their savings and retirement at a rapid clip  even with a very generous health insurance plan.Help Tamra kick this rare cancer!If you know Tamra  you know she is determined to fight this cancer. After all  she has an entire life ahead of her! She has two young children who need a mother! And she has an Air Force adventure in Germany awaiting her return!If you’re worried about Tamra and want to help in some meaningful way  consider making a gift to help support the Grelck family’s living expenses in the Bay Area. Tamra needs to focus on regaining her strength. Instead  she is focusing on:·        A monthly rent that  although the cheapest they could find  is still very expensive for a modest house near Stanford Hospital·        Groceries and healthy meal prep delivery for herself and the kids  both now and when Matt has to return to service in Germany later this spring·        Transportation around the Bay Area for the family·        Childcare in the Bay AreaThe Grelcks are a single-income military family. Any relief of out-of-pocket expenses will help Tamra focus solely on the fight of her life and meaningful time with her family. Thank you in advance for your love and care."

With the help of friends and family we have decided to reach out for your support and donations to help my mom remain strong  positive  and courageous as she takes on the coming challenges of fighting pancreatic cancer. The last two weeks have been life changing and we want people to know our story.Two weeks ago today  my mom woke up with jaundice  her skin and the whites of her eyes were turning yellow and so of course we went straight to the hospital. This came after weeks of not feeling well but up until this point it was easy to blame stomach aches on changes in diet and back pain on sleeping funny. A few days prior  my mom did see her regular physician to have some blood work and an ultrasound done  but we had not received the results of those tests yet. We had discussed possibilities based on our own research and what other people had been telling us  maybe gallstones? Or H Pylori? In the emergency room we never expected to be told that she had pancreatic cancer. The hospital admitted my mom and told us that she would need a biopsy done and a biliary stent put in to allow the bile to pass through normally again. The tumor had begun pushing into the surrounding area and created a bile blockage and this is why she was turning yellow with jaundice. We learned that this is usually how people find out they have pancreatic cancer  no other early detections or symptoms occur in most cases. My mom spent that Friday and the rest of the weekend at Torrance Memorial and finally on Tuesday morning she had her procedure done.  Everything went as planned for that procedure and she was able to come home with me and my brother later that night. She has been recovering from the procedure with some pain but she is a fighter  if you know my mom  you know she is tough when she needs to be! Heres the part that makes this extremely difficult to even talk about. My mom currently does not have insurance. You all know health insurance is a big problem for many of us right now. Even with better access to healthcare and for some  more affordable plans  the fact is that many of us struggle to pay for healthcare. For some of us  the changes to healthcare in recent years has made the prices of our healthcare go up just enough to make it unaffordable. My mom is someone who experienced this cost increase. My mom does now have insurance on the way and it will be effective in December.  The Oncologist told us my mom needs to get started with chemo treatments  as soon as possible. At this point the tumor is inoperable and needs to shrink before there is any chance of removing it. This is because the tumor is surrounding two arteries and trying to remove it now would not be successful. We are asking for your help. We need to raise money to help us pay for medical bills and so that my mom can start getting chemo treatments as soon as possible. My mom will not be working or getting her normal income during this time. Donations will also help bills and other expenses so that my mom can get through this difficult time without any added stress. Together  with friends  family  church  we can meet our goal! My mom has loved working at First Lutheran Church and School in Torrance for over 20 years providing morning  after school and summer daycare programs (known as FLASH or First Lutheran After School Hours) for grades kindergarten to 8th grade. She started working at FLS when I was in 6th grade and my brother was in 8th grade.  She has seen generations of kids grow up from kindergarten to graduating from 8th grade. She has lent her creativity and organizational skills to insuring the kids have a fun and safe place to go before and after school and all throughout the summer. She spreads the message of PEACE & LOVE to everyone and continues to be my strength as we take each day one at a time. Im reaching out to all our friends  family  neighbors  FLS families  alumni  faculty  and anyone else that my mom has inspired to live with PEACE & LOVE. Please bookmark this page and check back for our updates about my mom  Shelly Karasony.

"Medical","April 9, 2019","Gemma and Cody Toxic Mold Recovery Fund","$27,346","$75,000","141","7","141","145","LOSANGELES","CA","LOSING EVERYTHINGBack in July 2017  we moved to a new apartment and both started to become rapidly and increasingly ill. A mold testing company confirmed the presence of toxic mold in the apartment  and several lab tests from our doctor confirmed it was making us extremely sick.  One of the major blood test lab values that shows inflammation from mold exposure has a healthy normal range that should be under 2 000; Cody’s was nearly 20 000 and Gemma’s was nearly 10 000. In December of 2017  as a result of mold exposure  we were both diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) which is a complex illness considered to be an acquired brain injury. CIRS creates profound immune system dysregulation and damages multiple organ systems. Our doctor told us we needed to move immediately and get rid of almost everything we own. Because air-borne mold toxins attach to anything porous (clothes  electronics  books  photos  furniture  linens etc.)  if we brought all of our belongings with us  they would continue to expose our body to mold and make us sick. Our apartment building was not cooperative and we had to get a lawyer to help us get out of our lease. So at the beginning of 2018  we took our beloved cat  a few belongings that we could clean the mold from  and moved-- beginning our long and complicated recovery process. For a few months  it felt like we were camping in limbo with no furniture and none of our familiar things around us. Sleeping on the floor was really a grand adventure!Unfortunately for us  while toxic mold exposure is widely recognized as a health hazard  the associated illness is not recognized by health insurance and so almost all of our medical expenses have been out of pocket. Additionally  our renter’s insurance was unable to cover any of our losses due to lack of cooperation and acknowledgment of a problem by our landlord. We researched legal recourse about getting sick from mold and found that the options were extremely discouraging and unlikely to end in our favor. Before we became sick we were fortunate to be debt-free and now we have over $50k of medically related debt. Cody has been unable to work since the end of July 2017 and has had to repeatedly turn down work that he wants to do  because he is still too ill. Gemma has only been able to work around two days a week in her own practice for most of this time and still needs a lot of time to rest and recover.THE WORST OF IT..Cody lost 30+ lbs and went from working out five times a week to barely being able to walk for five minutes. He became bedridden the majority of the time with debilitating fatigue  numbness throughout his arms and legs  very low blood pressure  constant dizziness and sudden joint pain. For a long time he was unable to drive and has been unable to work at all since the end of 7/2017. Before getting sick he had a successful and rewarding career in software engineering/product management that he is hoping to be able to resume soon. Gemma started experiencing severe respiratory problems  severe food allergies causing her throat to close up  (even having to give up her beloved teas at a certain point)  debilitating nausea  edema  dizziness  extreme fatigue  painful rashes and muscle/joint pain. She also developed a painful tumor in her abdomen that luckily turned out to be benign. Before getting sick she was growing her psychotherapy practice while completing kids yoga teacher training. She has had to significantly scale back on her hours and put plans for further therapy training and certifications on hold. We both also developed systemic electrolyte imbalances  circulation issues  migraines  thyroid problems  staph infections in our sinuses  other co-infections throughout our bodies (because the mold mycotoxins weaken the body) and developed sensitivity to chemicals and artificial fragrance. In short  our immune systems became completely overloaded and sensitive to things that wouldn’t affect people with a healthy immune system. Because mold is a known neurotoxin  we both started to notice brain impairments stemming from neuro-inflammation  starting with severe brain fog and developing into issues with short-term memory and word recall. WHY US?Through many lab tests and working with a functional medicine doctor  Cody and I learned that we both have a specific genetic type in the HLA gene complex  that makes us susceptible to mold-related illnesses and other autoimmune illnesses. In people who don’t have this genetic profile  in being exposed to toxic mold your body would recognize the mold as an invader  mount an appropriate immune response and clear the toxins out of your body. You likely would not develop any symptoms or problems. Unfortunately  our bodies are not able to see and identify mold properly  so the immune system can’t respond appropriately and the mold never gets cleared out of the body. The toxic byproducts of mold continue to accumulate in the body  causing rampant inflammation and organ damage. In people like us who have become sick from toxic mold  the rates of autoimmune diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are significantly higher  so we are trying to be as proactive as possible in healing the damage that has been done and doing it quickly.WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR HELPThis illness has been a huge setback for us in terms of getting married and starting a family  which is ultimately our driving goal. Gemma has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember and is hoping that despite this illness  she will still be able to. The good news is that we have been in the recovery process from this illness for the last year and are slowly  but surely getting better. While it has been incredibly challenging and unbelievably scary at times  it has made our relationship stronger and better than ever. We have been true partners in this and will be forever grateful to have had each other throughout this process. Chronic illness has been a true test and has offered us a very new and different perspective on what is really important and meaningful in life. The bad news is that getting our health back has been much slower  complicated and more difficult than we imagined. We have exhausted many of the treatment protocols for CIRS and some of our lab markers are sadly still too high to progress to the next stages of treatment. Ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have a lot of success in reducing toxic burden  regulating immune functioning and lowering inflammation  so we are hoping that they will be a pivotal next step for us. We have tried both treatments and so far have found them helpful and encouraging. But the full courses of both treatments are lengthy and costly and we need some help in finishing this part of our treatment. After almost two years of being very ill  we feel that they are the best chance we have at getting our health and our lives back. We are looking to these recommended treatments to hopefully begin to truly get better and resume living a full life again. We would be so grateful for any help that you are able to offer. Thank you!WHAT YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO TOWARDS:$25k for needed diagnostics and treatmentsThese treatments are supposed to be incredibly effective and healing  but not covered by insurance as they are considered “off-label”.• MRI with neuroquant analysis to assess for brain damage and guide next steps in rehabilitation. • Ozone hematography therapy: 15-20 ozone treatments; $450 per treatment   $13 500 -$18 000 for both of us.Ozone is a treatment that involves removing blood  adding ozone to it and then recirculating the ozonated blood back in the body. Ozone is both detoxifying and healing at the same time  helping to remove toxins and pathogens  while helping the immune system regulate itself.• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: 40 HBOT treatments; $100 per treatment  $8 000 for both of usHyperbaric is a treatment that involves breathing in pure oxygen in a pressurized environment that allows oxygen to saturate cells in the body in a more profound way. Like ozone therapy  it helps heal infections and inflammation and is particularly effective for brain injuries.$50k for current medical debt:We have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on prescribed medications  supplements  doctors  diagnostics  lab tests  treatments  mold testing etc.  We also had to completely refurnish our new apartment  buy new clothes  computers  electronics  etc.Thank you for taking the time to read our story and offer any help if you are moved to do so. Any amount will help and please feel free to share with others if you’d like."

"Medical","November 16, 2018","Miracle for Meg","$26,055","$100,000","388","5","382","415","SAVANNAH","GA","!!Please check our UPDATES (the tab right of 'Story') for important information!!Follow along on her journey:Meghan's Photography Work Meghan's Personal Instagram Our sweet friend Meghan is in immediate need of surgeries and medical treatment in order to aid multiple complications arising from a degenerative disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (known as EDS.) Though we are providing her with care and support  cooking meals for her  carrying her up and down stairs  laughing and crying with her  her condition has gotten to a point where we are unable to give her the serious medical care she requires.Though we would not shy away from the challenge if we knew how! That is the contagious spirit we've absorbed from our friendships with Meghan. You see  Meghan has an oversized heart (figuratively; the best kind!) and we know that she will not let her condition put limitations on the opportunities in her life. But she needs our help. Aside from her physical condition  pain has touched many areas of her life  and although it is not our place to share those things publicly  we can tell you that she is grateful for her life and uses that pain to learn about herself and help others.Somehow  she is beaming with innocence and courage.With your kindness  we are raising money for upcoming costs related to complicated  major surgeries  that will change her life. Just like she has changed ours. We'll give you more details below.This is Meghan's story:A few months ago Meghan was bounding in the waves along the coast (floating helps relieve weight from her muscles and bones ) taking her Australian dogs on a roadtrip in the North Carolina hills and creating beautiful photographs as a professional photographer. Now  she struggles to walk to the bathroom. Sometimes she will even get down and crawl on the floor. As her friends  it is heartbreaking to watch what seems like never-ending waves of taking over her life.So  What's The Deal?Without going into too much detail  Meghan is suffering from a diverse array of chronic pain and degenerative symptoms due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. EDS is a disorder that causes hypermobility in joints and affects the connective-tissue in those that have it. Connective-tissue is the skin that wraps around our organs  muscles  nerves  veins and so on. Recently  connective-tissue was classified as an organ  which gives us so much hope for the future of EDS research and quality of life for those with EDS (hang in there guys.)Due to EDS  Meghan's joints bend in ways that ours do not  and it can be very dangerous. Large  dark bruises appear on her body overnight. We're pretty sure she's not a street fighter!Among the many symptoms that come with EDS  she experiences constant pain from the moment of waking up  all the way until the end of the night. Sometimes the days don't end for Meghan  and she cannot fall asleep for multiple days because of excruciating pain. But  what kind of pain?EDS is her overall condition  but it is common to have a bundle of disorders with EDS.Meghan also has Tethered-Cord (TC) which is when the spinal cord fails to detach from the bone structure of the spine. This likely happened in the womb  and causes many mobility issues and nerve issues  such as complete numbness in the legs (Meghan often can't feel her legs even when walking or driving ) intense and uncontrollable muscle spasms that happen at any moment and a variety of shooting pains throughout the nerves in her lower body. Just to name a few. There is also not much dura around her brain  which is basically jelly that cushions the brain against vibrations. Most people don't have to worry about it  but when driving Meghan we try to take side roads that have the least amount of potholes and cracks  because her brain jams into her spine on a slight bump and causes immobilizing pain. Just imagine your brain in a vice. Then there is the craniocervical instability. It means the vertebrae in her neck that support her head are highly unstable  and they actually pinch her brain stem. She cannot turn her head much at all  and she especially cannot tilt her head back like when you want to feel the rain on your face  or look at the clouds.And also POTS. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome if you want the full name. In simple terms  it is a syndrome which interferes with the rate of bloodflow as well as the heart rate. Sounds pretty straight forward  but it causes Meghan's body to have difficulty regulating her temperature  feeling extreme heat and cold in a place that is room temperature. It also causes gastrointestinal complications  foggy brain  fatigue  anxiety  headaches and migraines  intense chest pain and insomnia  to name a few. Her body is attacking itself in what seems like an endless cycle of pain. It is fighting itself and shutting down.Here's What's NextMeghan has been pushed off of her health insurance and is not eligible for disability. Currently  her family and friends are providing basic care and needs around the clock  but she urgently needs surgery. Like  yesterday.Earlier this week (mid-December) her primary EDS specialist in Baltimore  Dr. Clair Francomano  decided that the most important need for Meghan is to undergo a surgery for Tethered-Cord and detach her spinal cord from her spine. This surgery will be performed by Dr. Petra Klinge also in Baltimore  but we need to get Meghan there as soon as possible for a consultation.We are unsure how we will accomplish this financially  but nothing is impossible and we love our friend to the end of the earth. Following the surgery for Tethered-Cord  Meghan will rest and recover before having a Spinal Fusion surgery peformed by Dr. Frasier Henderson in Baltimore. This surgery will fuse her C1 and C2 vertebrae  stabilizing her neck and relieving pressure from her brain. It is a common experience by those who have undergone this surgery that their normal pain level goes from an 8-9/10 down to a 2-4/10. One day while we were watching her dogs Waverly and Dakota run in the park  Meghan told me that she dreamt of being able to run in and out of the trees with her dogs for just one minute. With this surgery  that would be a real possibility.What Meghan Needs From YouIf you are reading this  donate $1. There will be friends  family and strangers who will donate much more  but most people will not be able to. If a thousand people see this and donate $1  that $1 000 will cover roundtrip travel to her first surgery  two consultations or just a lot of milkshakes from Five Guys  which Meghan loves.It is not easy to understand what Meghan is going through by reading scientific reviews of her symptoms  or even reading this GoFundMe campaign. But when you see it with your eyes  it is right there; she is a wonderful person  and she is in so much pain. Let's succeed in raising the funds Meghan needs to enjoy some of the most basic things  like looking at the clouds. All donations made to this GoFundMe campain will go towards:- Major surgery for Tethered-Cord with Dr. Petra Klinge- Major surgery for Spinal Fusion with Dr. Frasier Henderson- Flights  hotels  Air BnBs  Ubers and expenses related to travel for surgeries- Service dog training through Compass Key Organization for Waverly  her energetic and loyal Australian Blue Heeler- CT scans needed - Living expenses during recovery- Health insurance premiums- In-home caregiver when needed- Mobility aids - Medical bills associated with consultations  surgery  bracing  orthotics  hospital fees etc."

This was a complete shock. Not only is he a non smoker and an avid free diver and fisherman but otherwise a very healthy person who showed no symptoms that something was wrong. This particular cancer although most common in Non-Smokers  is still very rare to find in someone of Manny's age range.Despite this heavy diagnosis Manny is considerably one of the luckiest people I know. . You can say that someone or something has always had their eye on him  helping him get out of situations you would only see in movies... The \"Force\" is strong in him. Thus far  this situation has been no different. He was able to obtain health insurance right before the cancer diagnosis  he tested positive for a Gene mutation that is very responsive to a particular treatment he is currently on  but most importantly and above all he is surrounded by people who love him that will do anything they can to help ease any additional stress possible during this difficult time. At this point Manny's only job is to heal. This is the reason for this go fund me. The money donated will help pay off his current medical debt which is north of $10 000 as well as help sustain his monthly expenses during his treatment. Although his insurance company very reluctantly approved of the $14 000 per month medication Manny is currently taking  it is possible that they can deny coverage in the future. The thought of that kind of financial stress is daunting. He is currently on his 10th day of treatment and besides following his doctors orders  he has also started following a restricted diet  maintaining his daily presence at the gym and going fishing as often as possible to maintain low stress levels. The funds collected throughout this campaign will ensure that his focus can remain on healing and not on the strain that finances can cause. Manny has been so incredibly strong during this and has been great at maintaining his friends and family as optimistic and positive as he has been. Assuring us that this will just be another crazy life story to add under his belt.Thank you all in advance for your donations  support  & prayers."

By the time Kelsey was in 5th grade  the cancer had progressed to stage 4  and metastasized to other parts of her body with the prognosis that she had only 2 years to live. However  due to Laurie’s incredibly active and healthy lifestyle as a marathon runner and avid nutrition enthusiast  she persevered for 6 years instead of 2! Sadly  when Kelsey was 16 years old  her mother died from metastatic breast cancer after a long  12 year battle. Kelsey’s mother fought the cancer with valiant determination and will. Growing up  Kelsey participated in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure every year  and ran by her mother’s side. Kelsey attended countless chemotherapy and radiation treatments  surgeries  etc. with her mother. Fighting cancer became a daily event  and a regular part of life for Kelsey and her family. Kelsey’s mom was always clear - be determined  be confident  and do everything you can to stay healthy.  She coaches at FitHaus (OurHaus CrossFit) and embodies the example of health and wellness we hope to share with everyone that walks through the doors.Kelsey (and her two younger brothers) have been tracked since a very young age due to the genetic component that is so commonly associated when breast cancer is diagnosed and terminal at such a young age in the mother. After several rounds of testing over the years and many recommendations from both Kelsey and Laurie’s previous primary and oncology doctors  Kelsey needs to undergo a double mastectomy as she is in the top 20% of high risk for breast cancer. Even though she does not test positive for the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes  there are many other genes associated with breast cancer  and with all variables included  doctors are highly suspect there is a genetic component at hand and are recommending surgery as a preventative measure as soon as she can since Kelsey is within 5 years of the age her mother was diagnosed. Kelsey’s mother and great grandmother both died of aggressive forms of breast cancer at young ages and due to the pathology of the type of cancer Laurie had  doctors and Kelsey and her family do not want to take any risks. Your help would be SO appreciated:Unfortunately health insurance only covers double mastectomy surgeries if the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes test positive. Since this is not the case for her  Kelsey and Heidi will have to take on the costs out of pocket despite the medical necessity of completing this surgery. With this in mind  our FitHaus family would like to support their family in any way we can  one being financially.  That is why we have set up this Go Fund Me page ... to help Kelsey and her family pay for the medical costs for her surgery and give back a little to all that Kelsey offers us on a daily basis.Kelsey is scheduled to have surgery March 20  2019 and will be off from coaching at FitHaus for about a week before returning.  There will be other ways to help out Kelsey and her family  but if you're able to contribute financially  that would be so appreciated by all."

Her symptoms began to get worse within hours  which required fluids to alleviate her elevated heart rate and IV antibiotics at the infusion center. The second day at the infusion center  she was transferred by ambulance to IHC. Eventually she was transferred to the ICU at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City where she was finally diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.Not many people (and doctors) are aware of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) which delayed the initial diagnosis and made her case very serious  very fast.  SJS is a potentially deadly autoimmune disease that usually results from a drug reaction.  It can be caused by taking something as simple as ibuprofen.  In Allison's case  it's currently being investigated what caused the reaction. At the time of her transfer  she was receiving 3 different IV antibiotics. Another form of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Both forms of the disease can be deadly  extremely painful and distressing.  TEN manifests itself by causing the skin tissue over more than 30 percent of your body  as well as inside your mouth and throat  to begin to blister  die and detach.  This was the case with Allison  her skin rashes (or lesions) blistered and peeled and severely affected her ability to swallow and breath as the lesions attacked her mouth and went down her throat which was not only very painful but life threatening as well. It is comparable to having 3rd degree burns all over your body and inside your mouth and throat  which is why many people afflicted with SJS are often treated in Burn Units. SJS/TEN caused the top layer of Allison's skin and her mucous membranes  such as those covering her lips and eyes to peel off in waves.  Treatment was assessed at the University of Utah hospital and Allison remained in ICU for several days as her symptoms worsened.  Treatment included standard therapies used for major burns and the most severe were the lesions on her eyes.  Allison was given 20 minutes warning that they were going to perform emergency surgery to save her eyesight. It would require her to be blind for nearly two weeks  and even then there was no way to predict the outcome of the surgery.  Her eyes were sewn completely shut for nearly two weeks  she could not see anything but darkness. Allison had to be treated with high doses of steroids which were known to cause delirium and psychosis. She required 24/7 care which often was her devoted husband  Kevin  friends Misty and Jen.  Allison’s pain management was not under control  and continuously made her ill. She would wake up in the middle of the night in the midst of delusions unable to see and she did not know where she was or what was happening to her.  Symptoms persisted and worsened for up to two weeks before the skin and mucous membranes began to start to regress. Even though the lesions have begun to heal  it takes months to recover from SJS.  The surgery she had on her eyes was a success  however  she does have some residual issues seeing clearly which we hope will improve with time. Allison will be required to be followed for several years  and may require additional surgeries.  One of the most unfortunate consequences from this traumatic experience is the fact that Allison has now been diagnosed with PTSD due to the weeks of blindness  uncontrollable pain  and psychosis brought on by the IV steroids. The purpose of this Go Fund Me page is two-fold.  One  to increase the awareness of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and how it can affect anyone at any time  and two  to help the family with the enormous hospital and doctor bills they have incurred.  While Allison did have health insurance  most of the hospital expenses were considered \"out of network\" with substantial out of pocket costs. It is unclear at this time if the insurance will pay for any of the costs related to the \"experimental\" eye surgery.  We do not have a final amount of these costs yet - only an estimate  but any amount you can donate will be extremely appreciated by Allison and her family.Allison was separated from her 5 daughters for nearly one month and they are extremely happy to have her home.  She still requires nursing care and regular doctor visits and it will be many months before the peeling blisters all over her face and body will fade. There will also need to be ongoing evaluations to make sure her internal organs are not affected   Allison wishes to express her heartfelt appreciation to everyone who cared for her family in any way at all  from taking the girls overnight and to school and bringing in meals for the family.  The entire family is grateful in ways they simply cannot express in words.Sincerely Lisa West (aka: Grammie)"

To control this iron overload  Jessica has been on a chelation infusion 24/7 for the past year.  This chelation did not help reduce her iron overload.Her doctors are now concerned that she may be transitioning to aplastic anemia.Jessica is admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center where she is undergoing second round of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  As expected with chemotherapy  she is having a rough time with her symptoms and has developed heart failure and pneumonia.For the next many months  Jessica will be unable to work due to exposure to other individuals and having a weakened immune system.Her Mother is a  Special Education Teacher for the Deaf and Handicapped and is on family leave to take care of Jessica.  Her Father is a disabled war Veteran  who is unable to work. The family income has been greatly reduced.We are asking your help with Jessica and her family.  In addition to the limited family income  there are unpaid medical bills and it is also necessary to perform home modifications to ensure her safety over the next year while her new immune system develops.  In January 2019  she will not have health insurance due to her age.Thank you in advance for your assistance ... it is really appreciated.Peggy YorkovichUpdate: November 12  2018Jessica was taken for an TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) this morning.  They are concerned that she may have a heart valve defect that may need to be corrected.  A TEE allows a better/internal view of the heart's structure.  The doctors were unable to perform the procedure because she is in respiratory distress. Update: November 13  2018Finally some good news.  Sort of.  Jessica feels a little better today and the TEE was able to be performed.   The heart mitral valve defect was discovered.  One of the 2 valves was completely deformed and most of the work was done by the other part of the valve.The cardiologist feels that this can be controlled by medication for the time being.  Further evaluation and any treatment can be performed after she is discharged from the hospital.Update: November 15  2018Very unhappy little girl today.  She was expecting to come home today  but her blood counts are down  she has respiratory distress again  and nosebleeds. Another chest x-ray is going to be performed.Update: November 17  2018She's home!  Very happy to sleep in her own bed and see her puppy.   We definitely have a lot to be thankful this Thanksgiving.  Now the long road to recovery begins ...Thank you everyone for your help during these difficult times.  Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Medical","April 9, 2019","Gemma and Cody Toxic Mold Recovery Fund","$27,346","$75,000","141","7","141","145","LOSANGELES","CA","LOSING EVERYTHINGBack in July 2017  we moved to a new apartment and both started to become rapidly and increasingly ill. A mold testing company confirmed the presence of toxic mold in the apartment  and several lab tests from our doctor confirmed it was making us extremely sick.  One of the major blood test lab values that shows inflammation from mold exposure has a healthy normal range that should be under 2 000; Cody’s was nearly 20 000 and Gemma’s was nearly 10 000. In December of 2017  as a result of mold exposure  we were both diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) which is a complex illness considered to be an acquired brain injury. CIRS creates profound immune system dysregulation and damages multiple organ systems. Our doctor told us we needed to move immediately and get rid of almost everything we own. Because air-borne mold toxins attach to anything porous (clothes  electronics  books  photos  furniture  linens etc.)  if we brought all of our belongings with us  they would continue to expose our body to mold and make us sick. Our apartment building was not cooperative and we had to get a lawyer to help us get out of our lease. So at the beginning of 2018  we took our beloved cat  a few belongings that we could clean the mold from  and moved-- beginning our long and complicated recovery process. For a few months  it felt like we were camping in limbo with no furniture and none of our familiar things around us. Sleeping on the floor was really a grand adventure!Unfortunately for us  while toxic mold exposure is widely recognized as a health hazard  the associated illness is not recognized by health insurance and so almost all of our medical expenses have been out of pocket. Additionally  our renter’s insurance was unable to cover any of our losses due to lack of cooperation and acknowledgment of a problem by our landlord. We researched legal recourse about getting sick from mold and found that the options were extremely discouraging and unlikely to end in our favor. Before we became sick we were fortunate to be debt-free and now we have over $50k of medically related debt. Cody has been unable to work since the end of July 2017 and has had to repeatedly turn down work that he wants to do  because he is still too ill. Gemma has only been able to work around two days a week in her own practice for most of this time and still needs a lot of time to rest and recover.THE WORST OF IT..Cody lost 30+ lbs and went from working out five times a week to barely being able to walk for five minutes. He became bedridden the majority of the time with debilitating fatigue  numbness throughout his arms and legs  very low blood pressure  constant dizziness and sudden joint pain. For a long time he was unable to drive and has been unable to work at all since the end of 7/2017. Before getting sick he had a successful and rewarding career in software engineering/product management that he is hoping to be able to resume soon. Gemma started experiencing severe respiratory problems  severe food allergies causing her throat to close up  (even having to give up her beloved teas at a certain point)  debilitating nausea  edema  dizziness  extreme fatigue  painful rashes and muscle/joint pain. She also developed a painful tumor in her abdomen that luckily turned out to be benign. Before getting sick she was growing her psychotherapy practice while completing kids yoga teacher training. She has had to significantly scale back on her hours and put plans for further therapy training and certifications on hold. We both also developed systemic electrolyte imbalances  circulation issues  migraines  thyroid problems  staph infections in our sinuses  other co-infections throughout our bodies (because the mold mycotoxins weaken the body) and developed sensitivity to chemicals and artificial fragrance. In short  our immune systems became completely overloaded and sensitive to things that wouldn’t affect people with a healthy immune system. Because mold is a known neurotoxin  we both started to notice brain impairments stemming from neuro-inflammation  starting with severe brain fog and developing into issues with short-term memory and word recall. WHY US?Through many lab tests and working with a functional medicine doctor  Cody and I learned that we both have a specific genetic type in the HLA gene complex  that makes us susceptible to mold-related illnesses and other autoimmune illnesses. In people who don’t have this genetic profile  in being exposed to toxic mold your body would recognize the mold as an invader  mount an appropriate immune response and clear the toxins out of your body. You likely would not develop any symptoms or problems. Unfortunately  our bodies are not able to see and identify mold properly  so the immune system can’t respond appropriately and the mold never gets cleared out of the body. The toxic byproducts of mold continue to accumulate in the body  causing rampant inflammation and organ damage. In people like us who have become sick from toxic mold  the rates of autoimmune diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are significantly higher  so we are trying to be as proactive as possible in healing the damage that has been done and doing it quickly.WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR HELPThis illness has been a huge setback for us in terms of getting married and starting a family  which is ultimately our driving goal. Gemma has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember and is hoping that despite this illness  she will still be able to. The good news is that we have been in the recovery process from this illness for the last year and are slowly  but surely getting better. While it has been incredibly challenging and unbelievably scary at times  it has made our relationship stronger and better than ever. We have been true partners in this and will be forever grateful to have had each other throughout this process. Chronic illness has been a true test and has offered us a very new and different perspective on what is really important and meaningful in life. The bad news is that getting our health back has been much slower  complicated and more difficult than we imagined. We have exhausted many of the treatment protocols for CIRS and some of our lab markers are sadly still too high to progress to the next stages of treatment. Ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have a lot of success in reducing toxic burden  regulating immune functioning and lowering inflammation  so we are hoping that they will be a pivotal next step for us. We have tried both treatments and so far have found them helpful and encouraging. But the full courses of both treatments are lengthy and costly and we need some help in finishing this part of our treatment. After almost two years of being very ill  we feel that they are the best chance we have at getting our health and our lives back. We are looking to these recommended treatments to hopefully begin to truly get better and resume living a full life again. We would be so grateful for any help that you are able to offer. Thank you!WHAT YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO TOWARDS:$25k for needed diagnostics and treatmentsThese treatments are supposed to be incredibly effective and healing  but not covered by insurance as they are considered “off-label”.• MRI with neuroquant analysis to assess for brain damage and guide next steps in rehabilitation. • Ozone hematography therapy: 15-20 ozone treatments; $450 per treatment   $13 500 -$18 000 for both of us.Ozone is a treatment that involves removing blood  adding ozone to it and then recirculating the ozonated blood back in the body. Ozone is both detoxifying and healing at the same time  helping to remove toxins and pathogens  while helping the immune system regulate itself.• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: 40 HBOT treatments; $100 per treatment  $8 000 for both of usHyperbaric is a treatment that involves breathing in pure oxygen in a pressurized environment that allows oxygen to saturate cells in the body in a more profound way. Like ozone therapy  it helps heal infections and inflammation and is particularly effective for brain injuries.$50k for current medical debt:We have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on prescribed medications  supplements  doctors  diagnostics  lab tests  treatments  mold testing etc.  We also had to completely refurnish our new apartment  buy new clothes  computers  electronics  etc.Thank you for taking the time to read our story and offer any help if you are moved to do so. Any amount will help and please feel free to share with others if you’d like."

"Medical","November 16, 2018","Miracle for Meg","$26,055","$100,000","388","5","382","415","SAVANNAH","GA","!!Please check our UPDATES (the tab right of 'Story') for important information!!Follow along on her journey:Meghan's Photography Work Meghan's Personal Instagram Our sweet friend Meghan is in immediate need of surgeries and medical treatment in order to aid multiple complications arising from a degenerative disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (known as EDS.) Though we are providing her with care and support  cooking meals for her  carrying her up and down stairs  laughing and crying with her  her condition has gotten to a point where we are unable to give her the serious medical care she requires.Though we would not shy away from the challenge if we knew how! That is the contagious spirit we've absorbed from our friendships with Meghan. You see  Meghan has an oversized heart (figuratively; the best kind!) and we know that she will not let her condition put limitations on the opportunities in her life. But she needs our help. Aside from her physical condition  pain has touched many areas of her life  and although it is not our place to share those things publicly  we can tell you that she is grateful for her life and uses that pain to learn about herself and help others.Somehow  she is beaming with innocence and courage.With your kindness  we are raising money for upcoming costs related to complicated  major surgeries  that will change her life. Just like she has changed ours. We'll give you more details below.This is Meghan's story:A few months ago Meghan was bounding in the waves along the coast (floating helps relieve weight from her muscles and bones ) taking her Australian dogs on a roadtrip in the North Carolina hills and creating beautiful photographs as a professional photographer. Now  she struggles to walk to the bathroom. Sometimes she will even get down and crawl on the floor. As her friends  it is heartbreaking to watch what seems like never-ending waves of taking over her life.So  What's The Deal?Without going into too much detail  Meghan is suffering from a diverse array of chronic pain and degenerative symptoms due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. EDS is a disorder that causes hypermobility in joints and affects the connective-tissue in those that have it. Connective-tissue is the skin that wraps around our organs  muscles  nerves  veins and so on. Recently  connective-tissue was classified as an organ  which gives us so much hope for the future of EDS research and quality of life for those with EDS (hang in there guys.)Due to EDS  Meghan's joints bend in ways that ours do not  and it can be very dangerous. Large  dark bruises appear on her body overnight. We're pretty sure she's not a street fighter!Among the many symptoms that come with EDS  she experiences constant pain from the moment of waking up  all the way until the end of the night. Sometimes the days don't end for Meghan  and she cannot fall asleep for multiple days because of excruciating pain. But  what kind of pain?EDS is her overall condition  but it is common to have a bundle of disorders with EDS.Meghan also has Tethered-Cord (TC) which is when the spinal cord fails to detach from the bone structure of the spine. This likely happened in the womb  and causes many mobility issues and nerve issues  such as complete numbness in the legs (Meghan often can't feel her legs even when walking or driving ) intense and uncontrollable muscle spasms that happen at any moment and a variety of shooting pains throughout the nerves in her lower body. Just to name a few. There is also not much dura around her brain  which is basically jelly that cushions the brain against vibrations. Most people don't have to worry about it  but when driving Meghan we try to take side roads that have the least amount of potholes and cracks  because her brain jams into her spine on a slight bump and causes immobilizing pain. Just imagine your brain in a vice. Then there is the craniocervical instability. It means the vertebrae in her neck that support her head are highly unstable  and they actually pinch her brain stem. She cannot turn her head much at all  and she especially cannot tilt her head back like when you want to feel the rain on your face  or look at the clouds.And also POTS. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome if you want the full name. In simple terms  it is a syndrome which interferes with the rate of bloodflow as well as the heart rate. Sounds pretty straight forward  but it causes Meghan's body to have difficulty regulating her temperature  feeling extreme heat and cold in a place that is room temperature. It also causes gastrointestinal complications  foggy brain  fatigue  anxiety  headaches and migraines  intense chest pain and insomnia  to name a few. Her body is attacking itself in what seems like an endless cycle of pain. It is fighting itself and shutting down.Here's What's NextMeghan has been pushed off of her health insurance and is not eligible for disability. Currently  her family and friends are providing basic care and needs around the clock  but she urgently needs surgery. Like  yesterday.Earlier this week (mid-December) her primary EDS specialist in Baltimore  Dr. Clair Francomano  decided that the most important need for Meghan is to undergo a surgery for Tethered-Cord and detach her spinal cord from her spine. This surgery will be performed by Dr. Petra Klinge also in Baltimore  but we need to get Meghan there as soon as possible for a consultation.We are unsure how we will accomplish this financially  but nothing is impossible and we love our friend to the end of the earth. Following the surgery for Tethered-Cord  Meghan will rest and recover before having a Spinal Fusion surgery peformed by Dr. Frasier Henderson in Baltimore. This surgery will fuse her C1 and C2 vertebrae  stabilizing her neck and relieving pressure from her brain. It is a common experience by those who have undergone this surgery that their normal pain level goes from an 8-9/10 down to a 2-4/10. One day while we were watching her dogs Waverly and Dakota run in the park  Meghan told me that she dreamt of being able to run in and out of the trees with her dogs for just one minute. With this surgery  that would be a real possibility.What Meghan Needs From YouIf you are reading this  donate $1. There will be friends  family and strangers who will donate much more  but most people will not be able to. If a thousand people see this and donate $1  that $1 000 will cover roundtrip travel to her first surgery  two consultations or just a lot of milkshakes from Five Guys  which Meghan loves.It is not easy to understand what Meghan is going through by reading scientific reviews of her symptoms  or even reading this GoFundMe campaign. But when you see it with your eyes  it is right there; she is a wonderful person  and she is in so much pain. Let's succeed in raising the funds Meghan needs to enjoy some of the most basic things  like looking at the clouds. All donations made to this GoFundMe campain will go towards:- Major surgery for Tethered-Cord with Dr. Petra Klinge- Major surgery for Spinal Fusion with Dr. Frasier Henderson- Flights  hotels  Air BnBs  Ubers and expenses related to travel for surgeries- Service dog training through Compass Key Organization for Waverly  her energetic and loyal Australian Blue Heeler- CT scans needed - Living expenses during recovery- Health insurance premiums- In-home caregiver when needed- Mobility aids - Medical bills associated with consultations  surgery  bracing  orthotics  hospital fees etc."

This was a complete shock. Not only is he a non smoker and an avid free diver and fisherman but otherwise a very healthy person who showed no symptoms that something was wrong. This particular cancer although most common in Non-Smokers  is still very rare to find in someone of Manny's age range.Despite this heavy diagnosis Manny is considerably one of the luckiest people I know. . You can say that someone or something has always had their eye on him  helping him get out of situations you would only see in movies... The \"Force\" is strong in him. Thus far  this situation has been no different. He was able to obtain health insurance right before the cancer diagnosis  he tested positive for a Gene mutation that is very responsive to a particular treatment he is currently on  but most importantly and above all he is surrounded by people who love him that will do anything they can to help ease any additional stress possible during this difficult time. At this point Manny's only job is to heal. This is the reason for this go fund me. The money donated will help pay off his current medical debt which is north of $10 000 as well as help sustain his monthly expenses during his treatment. Although his insurance company very reluctantly approved of the $14 000 per month medication Manny is currently taking  it is possible that they can deny coverage in the future. The thought of that kind of financial stress is daunting. He is currently on his 10th day of treatment and besides following his doctors orders  he has also started following a restricted diet  maintaining his daily presence at the gym and going fishing as often as possible to maintain low stress levels. The funds collected throughout this campaign will ensure that his focus can remain on healing and not on the strain that finances can cause. Manny has been so incredibly strong during this and has been great at maintaining his friends and family as optimistic and positive as he has been. Assuring us that this will just be another crazy life story to add under his belt.Thank you all in advance for your donations  support  & prayers."

By the time Kelsey was in 5th grade  the cancer had progressed to stage 4  and metastasized to other parts of her body with the prognosis that she had only 2 years to live. However  due to Laurie’s incredibly active and healthy lifestyle as a marathon runner and avid nutrition enthusiast  she persevered for 6 years instead of 2! Sadly  when Kelsey was 16 years old  her mother died from metastatic breast cancer after a long  12 year battle. Kelsey’s mother fought the cancer with valiant determination and will. Growing up  Kelsey participated in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure every year  and ran by her mother’s side. Kelsey attended countless chemotherapy and radiation treatments  surgeries  etc. with her mother. Fighting cancer became a daily event  and a regular part of life for Kelsey and her family. Kelsey’s mom was always clear - be determined  be confident  and do everything you can to stay healthy.  She coaches at FitHaus (OurHaus CrossFit) and embodies the example of health and wellness we hope to share with everyone that walks through the doors.Kelsey (and her two younger brothers) have been tracked since a very young age due to the genetic component that is so commonly associated when breast cancer is diagnosed and terminal at such a young age in the mother. After several rounds of testing over the years and many recommendations from both Kelsey and Laurie’s previous primary and oncology doctors  Kelsey needs to undergo a double mastectomy as she is in the top 20% of high risk for breast cancer. Even though she does not test positive for the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes  there are many other genes associated with breast cancer  and with all variables included  doctors are highly suspect there is a genetic component at hand and are recommending surgery as a preventative measure as soon as she can since Kelsey is within 5 years of the age her mother was diagnosed. Kelsey’s mother and great grandmother both died of aggressive forms of breast cancer at young ages and due to the pathology of the type of cancer Laurie had  doctors and Kelsey and her family do not want to take any risks. Your help would be SO appreciated:Unfortunately health insurance only covers double mastectomy surgeries if the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes test positive. Since this is not the case for her  Kelsey and Heidi will have to take on the costs out of pocket despite the medical necessity of completing this surgery. With this in mind  our FitHaus family would like to support their family in any way we can  one being financially.  That is why we have set up this Go Fund Me page ... to help Kelsey and her family pay for the medical costs for her surgery and give back a little to all that Kelsey offers us on a daily basis.Kelsey is scheduled to have surgery March 20  2019 and will be off from coaching at FitHaus for about a week before returning.  There will be other ways to help out Kelsey and her family  but if you're able to contribute financially  that would be so appreciated by all."

Hospital bills are increasing rapidly and soon rehabilitation costs will pile on as well.  In addition  a week prior to Andrea’s hospitalization  she started a new job  thus resulting in the termination of her family’s health insurance on February 28th.  Andrea’s husband  Tom  must now take on the cost of a much higher COBRA Health Plan premium for their family  in addition to losing Andrea’s monthly income and the growing medical expenses. Friends and family have been asking what they can do to help  so we have set up this fundraising page to help support Andrea  Tom and their two beautiful daughters  Ashley and Sarah.  We are extremely grateful for your generosity and sincerely appreciate any amount that you are able to donate. Please keep the prayers coming!"

Her symptoms began to get worse within hours  which required fluids to alleviate her elevated heart rate and IV antibiotics at the infusion center. The second day at the infusion center  she was transferred by ambulance to IHC. Eventually she was transferred to the ICU at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City where she was finally diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.Not many people (and doctors) are aware of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) which delayed the initial diagnosis and made her case very serious  very fast.  SJS is a potentially deadly autoimmune disease that usually results from a drug reaction.  It can be caused by taking something as simple as ibuprofen.  In Allison's case  it's currently being investigated what caused the reaction. At the time of her transfer  she was receiving 3 different IV antibiotics. Another form of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Both forms of the disease can be deadly  extremely painful and distressing.  TEN manifests itself by causing the skin tissue over more than 30 percent of your body  as well as inside your mouth and throat  to begin to blister  die and detach.  This was the case with Allison  her skin rashes (or lesions) blistered and peeled and severely affected her ability to swallow and breath as the lesions attacked her mouth and went down her throat which was not only very painful but life threatening as well. It is comparable to having 3rd degree burns all over your body and inside your mouth and throat  which is why many people afflicted with SJS are often treated in Burn Units. SJS/TEN caused the top layer of Allison's skin and her mucous membranes  such as those covering her lips and eyes to peel off in waves.  Treatment was assessed at the University of Utah hospital and Allison remained in ICU for several days as her symptoms worsened.  Treatment included standard therapies used for major burns and the most severe were the lesions on her eyes.  Allison was given 20 minutes warning that they were going to perform emergency surgery to save her eyesight. It would require her to be blind for nearly two weeks  and even then there was no way to predict the outcome of the surgery.  Her eyes were sewn completely shut for nearly two weeks  she could not see anything but darkness. Allison had to be treated with high doses of steroids which were known to cause delirium and psychosis. She required 24/7 care which often was her devoted husband  Kevin  friends Misty and Jen.  Allison’s pain management was not under control  and continuously made her ill. She would wake up in the middle of the night in the midst of delusions unable to see and she did not know where she was or what was happening to her.  Symptoms persisted and worsened for up to two weeks before the skin and mucous membranes began to start to regress. Even though the lesions have begun to heal  it takes months to recover from SJS.  The surgery she had on her eyes was a success  however  she does have some residual issues seeing clearly which we hope will improve with time. Allison will be required to be followed for several years  and may require additional surgeries.  One of the most unfortunate consequences from this traumatic experience is the fact that Allison has now been diagnosed with PTSD due to the weeks of blindness  uncontrollable pain  and psychosis brought on by the IV steroids. The purpose of this Go Fund Me page is two-fold.  One  to increase the awareness of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and how it can affect anyone at any time  and two  to help the family with the enormous hospital and doctor bills they have incurred.  While Allison did have health insurance  most of the hospital expenses were considered \"out of network\" with substantial out of pocket costs. It is unclear at this time if the insurance will pay for any of the costs related to the \"experimental\" eye surgery.  We do not have a final amount of these costs yet - only an estimate  but any amount you can donate will be extremely appreciated by Allison and her family.Allison was separated from her 5 daughters for nearly one month and they are extremely happy to have her home.  She still requires nursing care and regular doctor visits and it will be many months before the peeling blisters all over her face and body will fade. There will also need to be ongoing evaluations to make sure her internal organs are not affected   Allison wishes to express her heartfelt appreciation to everyone who cared for her family in any way at all  from taking the girls overnight and to school and bringing in meals for the family.  The entire family is grateful in ways they simply cannot express in words.Sincerely Lisa West (aka: Grammie)"

To control this iron overload  Jessica has been on a chelation infusion 24/7 for the past year.  This chelation did not help reduce her iron overload.Her doctors are now concerned that she may be transitioning to aplastic anemia.Jessica is admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center where she is undergoing second round of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  As expected with chemotherapy  she is having a rough time with her symptoms and has developed heart failure and pneumonia.For the next many months  Jessica will be unable to work due to exposure to other individuals and having a weakened immune system.Her Mother is a  Special Education Teacher for the Deaf and Handicapped and is on family leave to take care of Jessica.  Her Father is a disabled war Veteran  who is unable to work. The family income has been greatly reduced.We are asking your help with Jessica and her family.  In addition to the limited family income  there are unpaid medical bills and it is also necessary to perform home modifications to ensure her safety over the next year while her new immune system develops.  In January 2019  she will not have health insurance due to her age.Thank you in advance for your assistance ... it is really appreciated.Peggy YorkovichUpdate: November 12  2018Jessica was taken for an TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) this morning.  They are concerned that she may have a heart valve defect that may need to be corrected.  A TEE allows a better/internal view of the heart's structure.  The doctors were unable to perform the procedure because she is in respiratory distress. Update: November 13  2018Finally some good news.  Sort of.  Jessica feels a little better today and the TEE was able to be performed.   The heart mitral valve defect was discovered.  One of the 2 valves was completely deformed and most of the work was done by the other part of the valve.The cardiologist feels that this can be controlled by medication for the time being.  Further evaluation and any treatment can be performed after she is discharged from the hospital.Update: November 15  2018Very unhappy little girl today.  She was expecting to come home today  but her blood counts are down  she has respiratory distress again  and nosebleeds. Another chest x-ray is going to be performed.Update: November 17  2018She's home!  Very happy to sleep in her own bed and see her puppy.   We definitely have a lot to be thankful this Thanksgiving.  Now the long road to recovery begins ...Thank you everyone for your help during these difficult times.  Happy Thanksgiving!"

Hannah has lined up a great team to help her through her journey at St. Charles Cancer Center in Bend.  Her current treatment plan includes 16 rounds of chemo over the next 5 months  followed by a double mastectomy and then radiation.Hannah’s aggressive treatment plan will pull her away from the things she loves most - riding her mountain bike  building our off-grid house  teaching mountain bike skills  cooking and traveling.  Hannah has climbed a lot of mountains in her lifetime but this will be the toughest uphill climb she’s faced yet.In addition to the unwavering support of Hannah’s parents and extended family  she has seen an overwhelming outpouring of support from her community of mountain bikers  friends  colleagues and even digital strangers who have followed her through her numerous inspiring journeys.  As you likely know  Hannah is fiercely independent and with that  a bit hesitant to acknowledge when she needs a helping hand.  But right now  she really does need our help.  Your support here will allow us to reduce the financial burden of this diagnosis and give Hannah a safe space to heal.  We are just 2 weeks into this journey and the expenses have already started to mount.  While Hannah has health insurance  living 2 hours from the cancer center will require added travel and accommodation expenses.   Additionally  Hannah will likely to be unable to work for some time.Any funds raised here will help to cover a long list of expenses including:Insurance deductible / co-insurance  fuel costs to/from St. Charles Cancer Center  accommodations 1-3 nights per week in Bend for the next 9 months  non-covered medical expenses  nourishing meals  plus anything else she may need to be comfortable during her battle.Through all this  Hannah has remained incredibly hopeful and good spirited.   We will continue to post progress updates here so you can follow along on her journey and cheer her to the cancer-free finish line.From the bottom of my heart  thank you for loving and supporting Hannah.-RichardFor those who have inquired  Hannah can receive mail at the following address:Hannah Levine6510 S 6th St #135Klamath Falls  OR97603Hannah will also continue to share her journey on instagram @hannahandvannah"

A wife  mother  daughter  sister  aunt  and friend. She is full of love and generosity. She has a sense of humor and one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know. She is mindful  optimistic  and is not someone who easily asks for help. This go fund me is not something we ever thought we would write for my sister-in-law Joanne  but she has just received her fourth cancer diagnosis in eight years. She and her family need our help now more than ever. Below is her story. Please consider donating. Any amount helps and comes at a time when she and her family need it most. First DiagnosisEight years ago  in February 2011 I got a call from my future father-in-law. Joanne  my sister-in-law to be  was just diagnosed with a brain tumor and would need surgery. I will never forget exactly where I was when I took that call. She had Hemangiopericytoma. And although we knew this was a rare and aggressive cancer  we had no idea what the extent of it would be.Joanne underwent surgery in March 2011 followed by six weeks of radiation in North Carolina where she lives with her husband Craig and her son Cole. Joanne’s brother Steve and I had a wedding planned where we live in Chicago that following August. After a life-changing surgery  the doctors did not seem worried  and Joanne recovered from what we hoped was a one-time setback. She was a bridesmaid  Cole  nine at the time  our ring bearer. We were grateful for her recovery and thought our biggest issue was how the stylist would fix her hair to cover the scar and where her head was shaved for the surgery.The Madonna Morse Family at our wedding  (August 2011)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (August 2011)Joanne gives son Cole (age 9) a kiss (August 2011)Except for a yearly brain scan  we allowed the incident to slip further into the past as we celebrated the present with Joanne. We watched Cole play basketball  graduate from eighth grade and go on to high school  took family trips to the beach in Cape May  NJ with Steve’s parents and both of his sisters  came together for Christmases  and eventually had two baby girls who Aunt Joanne showered with love and affection.Aunt Alisa with Cole (age 10) in Cape May (Summer 2012)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (Christmas 2015)Madonna Morse Family Christmas (2015)Second DiagnosisFor six years we believed Joanne to be cancer free. Then in August of 2017  just after Joanne visited us in Chicago  Joanne got another diagnosis that would have far greater consequences than the first. The hemangiopericytoma had metastasized to her liver. Scattered throughout the country  Christmas is the time the Madonna-Morse family usually comes together. For the first time in 11 years (since 2006  the year after Steve and I first met) we did not spend Christmas together as Joanne’s surgery was scheduled for the day after Christmas.Removing the entire left lobe of her liver would prove to be much more difficult and painful than her brain surgery six years prior  especially as the liver worked to regenerate itself after surgery. Recovery was long and tough. With Joanne unable to work  her husband Craig became their only source of income and health insurance. Though Craig wanted to be by Joanne’s side every moment  he could not afford to take off enough work for Joanne’s entire recovery. He chose to take time off for the surgery. Their father  Steve Sr. had also been diagnosed with cancer  multiple myeloma  and had been sick. With his parents unable to travel  Steve  Alisa and I  saved our vacation to be with Joanne in January after the surgery. Steve and I took our whole circus with – two very lively daughters that served as a much-needed distraction  and our stay was followed by time with Joanne’s sister Alisa.Uncle Steve cooks with Cole  (January 2018)Zada sits with her Aunt Joanne after the surgery - we had to keep reminding her not to jump on her aunt! (January 2018)We were all so grateful for the way Joanne’s family  friends  and community stepped up to help her  her husband Craig  and their now teenage son Cole at this time of great need. Although the recovery was hard and long  Joanne’s optimism persisted. That summer in 2017  we gathered in New Jersey to celebrate the happy news of the newest addition to our family. Alisa and her husband Brian’s newborn son  Lincoln  a rainbow baby who we had all been waiting a very long time to meet. Joanne holds baby Lincoln for the first time. (July 2018)Third DiagnosisJoanne had been through a lot. More in the last several years than some people go through in a lifetime. To celebrate  Steve’s parents wanted us to spend Christmas together as a family in Key West. We were looking forward to a much-needed beach vacation that brought us all together again and to celebrate what we hoped would be a cancer-free Joanne. The opposite happened. Several days before leaving for the trip  Joanne went to the doctor for some hip pain. Knowing her medical record  the doctor ordered a CT scan. With suitcases already packed  we got the news that her cancer had metastasized again — this time in her hip. There was danger in fracturing the hip bone  and if the hip fractured the cancer would no longer be contained  so the doctors ordered Joanne to keep the weight off her hip. We asked her what she wanted to do. Should we cancel the trip? Should we go out to North Carolina and stay with her instead? Absolutely not. She was determined to follow through with our beach Christmas. Although we were so grateful to be together  with Joanne confined to a wheelchair  we also had the ominous and visible reminder of what lay ahead for Joanne. My daughter Zada  now five  only knew that Aunt Joanne had an owie. With restricted movement  Joanne  usually the super aunt who is kind enough to babysit so that my husband and I can get a minute to ourselves  was unable to enjoy her nieces and newborn nephew in the way she so desperately wanted to  but was at least able to delight in seeing Cole with his baby cousins.To say it was heartbreaking would be an understatement. But Joanne is a fighter. She took no time to feel sorry for herself and had no time to wallow. She had an MRI scheduled the week we got back as well as an appointment with an oncologist who specializes in rare cancers. After seeing the results of the MRI scan  the Charlotte surgeon’s office called. Based on the results  they put her surgery on the schedule even before she had a chance to meet him first.__________________________________________________________________Facebook Post from Joanne 1.9.19\"It has been an extremely busy week for us. On Wednesday we met with an oncology orthopedic surgeon here in Charlotte at the Levine Cancer Institute. And today we went to Duke to meet with another surgeon (same kind) and a doctor that specializes in rare cancers and sarcomas. All 3 doctors were incredible!We have made the decision to have surgery here in Charlotte as it is closer to home and we have learned the doctor is probably the top in the state who does this and has been doing it for 25 years. So surgery is TOMORROW!We are extremely exhausted but so grateful for the opportunities to have met these wonderful specialists.Please keep us all in your prayersThere is still a lot of healing that needs to be done for all 3 of us.I thank you for all the wonderful texts  messages  calls  cards  food  love  and support we have received. It takes a village in times like these  and we are grateful for ours...especially because this has been 3 times.Love to you all! Will update sometime after surgery. ❤️❤️\"__________________________________________________________________A partial hip replacement and Joanne was on the road to recovery once again.This time her cousin Kathy flew to North Carolina from New Jersey to help out.

Why you do a FB UPDATE of course!Surgery went well...YAY! I was nauseous all day but that finally has subsided. I am in pain but grateful that it pales in comparison to last year.The doctor was able to remove the cancerous section of the bone and put a new ball and rod in. Now we wait for next steps.I’ll most likely be here for another night or two.Thank you again for being an incredible support system.Now to attempt to get a little thing called sleep before my next poke and prod session!\"__________________________________________________________________But  she has been a victim of identity theft: __________________________________________________________________ Facebook Post from Joanne 1.27.19\"I’ve been the victim of Identity Theft...But not in your typical fashion.Today I looked in the mirror and once again didn’t recognize the woman looking back at me. She was tired...haggard looking...unsure of who she is or who she’s supposed to be.This is the side of dealing with a major illness that can creep up on you. A side that is not talked about when preparing for your next round of excavating cancer from your body. The priority is of course to rid you of your cells that have gone rogue. And that’s a perfect starting point as you don’t want more cells to misbehave and have the tumor get bigger or even cause trouble in another area of your body.But what about after? I’m so incredibly grateful to be alive. I’m healing physically bit by bit each day. I’m left with more physical scars that will eventually fade...but what about the mental and emotional ones of staring your mortality down once again?That’s not as easy to heal. I’m not the same person. And some days - like today - I’m not sure who I am anymore.When you have been on survival mode for so long - you can lose sight of yourself along the way.So just as in real identity theft I am strapped in for a long haul...it will be messy...frustrating...probably will seem as it will go on forever.But I know that I’m strong and eventually will prevail. It will take some time...some tears...lots of support from family  friends  and the professionals...and most of all it will take showing myself some grace and understanding.I will regain my identity! It just may be a different - more improved - version of myself!\"__________________________________________________________________Joanne barely had the chance to regain her identity when she received her fourth and most devastating diagnosis.__________________________________________________________________Fourth DiagnosisFB Post from Joanne 2.23.2019\"Well it is time to rise again!!!I have come full circle. The cancerous tumor that was in my brain 8 years ago is now back. Busy week ahead... brain surgeon appointment ... oncology appointment at Levine Cancer Institute ... and more.Please keep us in your prayers. We sure need them! \"_______________________________________________________________________________________Dealing with the tumor in her hip put Joanne a few months behind for her annual brain scan. When she went for her brain scan after her hip surgery  we learned that her cancer has come full circle and metastasized to her brain. In the 14 years  my husband and I have been together  I can count the number of times I have seen him cry. He cried when we got married when our daughters were born when my father died  and now with this horrible news about his sister. Although Joanne has been through every emotion you can imagine  instead of dwelling on anger and the why as in “why is this happening to me?” she is focused on the what. “OK – this is my new reality  and what am I going to do about it.” I have heard her say that she is lucky  that many people have had worse to deal with. But right now  at this moment  for our family  it feels like we’ve been climbing a mountain  a mountain that continues to grow despite our tireless efforts to reach the top. And now we need your help:CT scans  MRI appointments  trips to surgeons and specialists have taken up Joanne's days and weeks. Cancer and survival have become her full-time job. This new tumor is the size of a lime under her brain behind her left eye and has already messed with the bone structure of the skull  and after seeing several specialists and having her scans reviewed by a team of surgeons  it has been determined that surgery at this point is too risky. They are recommending radiation to stop the growth of the tumor. This is not a permanent solution. Radiation will not eliminate this tumor  or even shrink it. It will only keep it from growing. The numbness on the left side of Joanne's face that is caused by the tumor will remain  but with radiation  we hope to save her eyesight. Despite having health insurance  their family already has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Beyond the radiation she will receive for this tumor  it is inevitable that she will continue with oncology appointments  visits to specialists  follow up treatments  and regular scans to detect the cancer early if it metastisizes again. Surgery may be necessary in the future and with  radiation  chemo  and the uncertainty of what future treatment she’ll need  the bills continue to pile up  and this newest diagnosis will come with tens of thousands of dollars more. As we search for alternative treatments and clinical trials  Joanne will have to travel to see specialists we hope can offer new and more successful treatment options. We are asking for your help to get her the treatment she needs. We are asking because all we can do is support her and her family by alleviating some of the financial burdens of costly doctor’s appointments and medical treatments so their family may focus on the monumental endeavor of survival.When her son Cole asks what he can do because he feels like he is not doing enough for his mom  she tells him the best thing he can do for her is to focus on being a teenager. Keep his grades up  stick with extracurriculars  and live his best high school experience. Let’s help Cole live his best high school experience and do all we can to ensure his mom is there for his high school graduation  his college graduation and beyond. Thank you so much for donating. We have endless appreciation for your generosity under these most difficult of circumstances. #CancerCantKeepJoDown"

Katharine started to feel a little under the weather about a month ago. She shrugged it off  kept helping out with her family and non-profits. Under the weather became flu-like with some back pain. A close friend finally dragged her to the doctor. Sadly  it was not the flu.In the course of a month  Inflammatory Breast Cancer had moved rapidly from her breast to her lymph nodes to her liver and spine.  IBC is a very fast moving and aggressive cancer -a terrible foe. Katharine spent most of the last week in the ICU at Newton-Wellesley fighting for her life. She's through the first round of chemo  and her liver and kidneys are now fighting to clear her blood stream of the chemo and dead tumor cells. She'll be in the hospital until they catch up  and will face weeks of chemo ahead. IBC is generally pretty responsive to chemo  but Katharine has a huge fight ahead of her.We're hoping that you'll help pick up the fight with her. As many of you know  Katharine has worked for a variety of non-profits  trading the fulfillment of the work for the safety of a corporate job. Her work helping others doesn't come with those little insurance perks  like disability insurance  that are so incredibly helpful at a time like this.So this is our Crusade for Katharine. We're raising money to help pay the bills.

"Medical","January 22, 2019","Help Breanne Beat Cancer","$20,787","$100,000","231","2","234","684","ATLANTA","GA","I woke up in the middle of the night lying in a pool of blood. That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am  as blood poured out of my body in sheets  a terrifying reality struck: I was alone  1200 miles from home  unemployed  without health insurance  and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home  near my family to face this crisis. So  I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later  I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once  I stopped to catch my breath  arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30  my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival  I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. \"I don’t belong here  I thought.\" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests  nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food  and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion ” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning  doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure  my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said  “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat  perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know ” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later  they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs  but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum  resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging  on December 18th  they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer  especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like  or what it feels like  or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase  but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place  unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration  and any amount remaining following an injection  is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore  according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called  The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies   “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival  BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy  some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight  which may or may not go away  hair loss  loss of appetite  nausea  unusual tiredness or fatigue  dizziness  “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation  brain fog  and cognitive impairment —which can last for years  changes in vision  sores in mouth or throat  diarrhea  vomiting  impaired immune system function  rash  hives  itching  difficulty breathing/swallowing  nosebleeds  coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!)  pink  red  or dark brown urine  unusual bleeding or bruising  and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer  so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old  but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs  therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression  loss of identity  and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug  doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs  which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo  approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning  even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test  Caris test). So  I asked my oncologist  who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately  if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take  but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy  visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil  the drug my doctor has prescribed for me  and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy  each 12 to 16-weeks long  I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects  high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation  my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries  five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea  rectal bleeding  bladder and vaginal irritation  redness and itching to the treated area  brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis)  sexual side effects  and incontinence—or more commonly  the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So  in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery  I get to wear an adult diaper  just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes  too?If you’re still reading at this point  perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is  yes  there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is  the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates  the father of modern medicine said  “first  do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus  I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books  Chris Beat Cancer   by Chris Wark  and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life   by David Servan-Schreiber  MD  PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside  one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed  but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But  since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food  whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice  and in less than a month  I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural  holistic  or alternative medicines in the United States  and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland  Greece  and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A  IV-vitamin C  IV-mistletoe  IV-curcumin  far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells  hyperbolic oxygen chamber  Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment  acupuncture  mind-body therapy  and many  many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer  healthier alternative to healing cancer  they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life  I’ve been called stupid  and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend  then I do not have their support. At times  I’ve never felt more alone. So  I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers  I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now  I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money  especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue  no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents  I now have insurance  but due to the circumstances of my health crisis  I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me  that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that  no matter what  I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive  least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you  I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar. Donate a word of advice or recommendation to a doctor. Forward my story to friends or someone you know that may be able to help. Share with me your stories of success and failure when you were battling your own illnesses. Say a prayer for my healing. I can’t promise I will ever be able to pay back the money I hope to raise  but I can promise to pay it forward. I can promise to be an advocate for health and nutrition; I can promise to keep you informed every step of the way; and I can promise to help the next person in line who finds themselves in my situation—terrified and fighting for her life with a glimmer of hope that toxic medicine isn’t the way to survival.

He was very excited to be graduating magna cum laude in May and was looking forward to getting a great job in the aviation industry.On Friday  1/11  Matt was riding his motorcycle home from work as a teaching assistant at ERAU when a car cut him off  sending him flying more than 80 feet from the point of impact! He suffered two broken legs  a broken hand  a skull fracture and broke his back in two places.The other driver  a woman who was out of jail on bond for drug charges  was cited for the accident. Unfortunately she had no liability coverage and her insurance will pay only $10 000 of Matt’s medical costs. ... which is barely a drop in the bucket of what likely already exceeds $100 000. Matt’s student health insurance will pay some of the bills but there are loads of expenses that Matt’s family has already incurred with no end in sight.Matt is an amazing young man with a great future. Just as he has surmounted all kinds of difficulties —including his dad’s sudden death — in the past  he is determined to recover fully and return to ERAU in either the summer or the fall to finish his degree. But he needs help to meet the ever-rising expenses caused to him by no fault of his own.Those will include the cost of skilled nursing for a month or so to help him recuperate from his injuries enough to go into intensive inpatient rehabilitation and then the support he needs to transition home (probably in a wheelchair).His mom and brother have been in Florida since the day of the accident and are doing everything they can to help him as he heals from these awful injuries. We want to help them by raising $25 000 to meet some of Matt’s many related expenses including copays and deductibles.Lots of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help. The answer is yes: please donate here to  Matt Deckman's Recovery Fund. Then  you can \"like\" and \"share\" with your family and friends and ask them to lend a hand.

She and her family need our help now more than ever. Below is her story. Please consider donating. Any amount helps and comes at a time when she and her family need it most. First DiagnosisEight years ago  in February 2011 I got a call from my future father-in-law. Joanne  my sister-in-law to be  was just diagnosed with a brain tumor and would need surgery. I will never forget exactly where I was when I took that call. She had Hemangiopericytoma. And although we knew this was a rare and aggressive cancer  we had no idea what the extent of it would be.Joanne underwent surgery in March 2011 followed by six weeks of radiation in North Carolina where she lives with her husband Craig and her son Cole. Joanne’s brother Steve and I had a wedding planned where we live in Chicago that following August. After a life-changing surgery  the doctors did not seem worried  and Joanne recovered from what we hoped was a one-time setback. She was a bridesmaid  Cole  nine at the time  our ring bearer. We were grateful for her recovery and thought our biggest issue was how the stylist would fix her hair to cover the scar and where her head was shaved for the surgery.The Madonna Morse Family at our wedding  (August 2011)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (August 2011)Joanne gives son Cole (age 9) a kiss (August 2011)Except for a yearly brain scan  we allowed the incident to slip further into the past as we celebrated the present with Joanne. We watched Cole play basketball  graduate from eighth grade and go on to high school  took family trips to the beach in Cape May  NJ with Steve’s parents and both of his sisters  came together for Christmases  and eventually had two baby girls who Aunt Joanne showered with love and affection.Aunt Alisa with Cole (age 10) in Cape May (Summer 2012)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (Christmas 2015)Madonna Morse Family Christmas (2015)Second DiagnosisFor six years we believed Joanne to be cancer free. Then in August of 2017  just after Joanne visited us in Chicago  Joanne got another diagnosis that would have far greater consequences than the first. The hemangiopericytoma had metastasized to her liver. Scattered throughout the country  Christmas is the time the Madonna-Morse family usually comes together. For the first time in 11 years (since 2006  the year after Steve and I first met) we did not spend Christmas together as Joanne’s surgery was scheduled for the day after Christmas.Removing the entire left lobe of her liver would prove to be much more difficult and painful than her brain surgery six years prior  especially as the liver worked to regenerate itself after surgery. Recovery was long and tough. With Joanne unable to work  her husband Craig became their only source of income and health insurance. Though Craig wanted to be by Joanne’s side every moment  he could not afford to take off enough work for Joanne’s entire recovery. He chose to take time off for the surgery. Their father  Steve Sr. had also been diagnosed with cancer  multiple myeloma  and had been sick. With his parents unable to travel  Steve  Alisa and I  saved our vacation to be with Joanne in January after the surgery. Steve and I took our whole circus with – two very lively daughters that served as a much-needed distraction  and our stay was followed by time with Joanne’s sister Alisa.Uncle Steve cooks with Cole  (January 2018)Zada sits with her Aunt Joanne after the surgery - we had to keep reminding her not to jump on her aunt! (January 2018)We were all so grateful for the way Joanne’s family  friends  and community stepped up to help her  her husband Craig  and their now teenage son Cole at this time of great need. Although the recovery was hard and long  Joanne’s optimism persisted. That summer in 2017  we gathered in New Jersey to celebrate the happy news of the newest addition to our family. Alisa and her husband Brian’s newborn son  Lincoln  a rainbow baby who we had all been waiting a very long time to meet. Joanne holds baby Lincoln for the first time. (July 2018)Third DiagnosisJoanne had been through a lot. More in the last several years than some people go through in a lifetime. To celebrate  Steve’s parents wanted us to spend Christmas together as a family in Key West. We were looking forward to a much-needed beach vacation that brought us all together again and to celebrate what we hoped would be a cancer-free Joanne. The opposite happened. Several days before leaving for the trip  Joanne went to the doctor for some hip pain. Knowing her medical record  the doctor ordered a CT scan. With suitcases already packed  we got the news that her cancer had metastasized again — this time in her hip. There was danger in fracturing the hip bone  and if the hip fractured the cancer would no longer be contained  so the doctors ordered Joanne to keep the weight off her hip. We asked her what she wanted to do. Should we cancel the trip? Should we go out to North Carolina and stay with her instead? Absolutely not. She was determined to follow through with our beach Christmas. Although we were so grateful to be together  with Joanne confined to a wheelchair  we also had the ominous and visible reminder of what lay ahead for Joanne. My daughter Zada  now five  only knew that Aunt Joanne had an owie. With restricted movement  Joanne  usually the super aunt who is kind enough to babysit so that my husband and I can get a minute to ourselves  was unable to enjoy her nieces and newborn nephew in the way she so desperately wanted to  but was at least able to delight in seeing Cole with his baby cousins.To say it was heartbreaking would be an understatement. But Joanne is a fighter. She took no time to feel sorry for herself and had no time to wallow. She had an MRI scheduled the week we got back as well as an appointment with an oncologist who specializes in rare cancers. After seeing the results of the MRI scan  the Charlotte surgeon’s office called. Based on the results  they put her surgery on the schedule even before she had a chance to meet him first.__________________________________________________________________Facebook Post from Joanne 1.9.19\"It has been an extremely busy week for us. On Wednesday we met with an oncology orthopedic surgeon here in Charlotte at the Levine Cancer Institute. And today we went to Duke to meet with another surgeon (same kind) and a doctor that specializes in rare cancers and sarcomas. All 3 doctors were incredible!We have made the decision to have surgery here in Charlotte as it is closer to home and we have learned the doctor is probably the top in the state who does this and has been doing it for 25 years. So surgery is TOMORROW!We are extremely exhausted but so grateful for the opportunities to have met these wonderful specialists.Please keep us all in your prayersThere is still a lot of healing that needs to be done for all 3 of us.I thank you for all the wonderful texts  messages  calls  cards  food  love  and support we have received. It takes a village in times like these  and we are grateful for ours...especially because this has been 3 times.Love to you all! Will update sometime after surgery. ❤️❤️\"__________________________________________________________________A partial hip replacement and Joanne was on the road to recovery once again.This time her cousin Kathy flew to North Carolina from New Jersey to help out.

She was tired...haggard looking...unsure of who she is or who she’s supposed to be.This is the side of dealing with a major illness that can creep up on you. A side that is not talked about when preparing for your next round of excavating cancer from your body. The priority is of course to rid you of your cells that have gone rogue. And that’s a perfect starting point as you don’t want more cells to misbehave and have the tumor get bigger or even cause trouble in another area of your body.But what about after? I’m so incredibly grateful to be alive. I’m healing physically bit by bit each day. I’m left with more physical scars that will eventually fade...but what about the mental and emotional ones of staring your mortality down once again?That’s not as easy to heal. I’m not the same person. And some days - like today - I’m not sure who I am anymore.When you have been on survival mode for so long - you can lose sight of yourself along the way.So just as in real identity theft I am strapped in for a long haul...it will be messy...frustrating...probably will seem as it will go on forever.But I know that I’m strong and eventually will prevail. It will take some time...some tears...lots of support from family  friends  and the professionals...and most of all it will take showing myself some grace and understanding.I will regain my identity!

The cancerous tumor that was in my brain 8 years ago is now back. Busy week ahead... brain surgeon appointment ... oncology appointment at Levine Cancer Institute ... and more.Please keep us in your prayers. We sure need them! \"_______________________________________________________________________________________Dealing with the tumor in her hip put Joanne a few months behind for her annual brain scan. When she went for her brain scan after her hip surgery  we learned that her cancer has come full circle and metastasized to her brain. In the 14 years  my husband and I have been together  I can count the number of times I have seen him cry. He cried when we got married when our daughters were born when my father died  and now with this horrible news about his sister. Although Joanne has been through every emotion you can imagine  instead of dwelling on anger and the why as in “why is this happening to me?” she is focused on the what. “OK – this is my new reality  and what am I going to do about it.” I have heard her say that she is lucky  that many people have had worse to deal with. But right now  at this moment  for our family  it feels like we’ve been climbing a mountain  a mountain that continues to grow despite our tireless efforts to reach the top. And now we need your help:CT scans  MRI appointments  trips to surgeons and specialists have taken up Joanne's days and weeks. Cancer and survival have become her full-time job. This new tumor is the size of a lime under her brain behind her left eye and has already messed with the bone structure of the skull  and after seeing several specialists and having her scans reviewed by a team of surgeons  it has been determined that surgery at this point is too risky. They are recommending radiation to stop the growth of the tumor. This is not a permanent solution. Radiation will not eliminate this tumor  or even shrink it. It will only keep it from growing. The numbness on the left side of Joanne's face that is caused by the tumor will remain  but with radiation  we hope to save her eyesight. Despite having health insurance  their family already has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Beyond the radiation she will receive for this tumor  it is inevitable that she will continue with oncology appointments  visits to specialists  follow up treatments  and regular scans to detect the cancer early if it metastisizes again. Surgery may be necessary in the future and with  radiation  chemo  and the uncertainty of what future treatment she’ll need  the bills continue to pile up  and this newest diagnosis will come with tens of thousands of dollars more. As we search for alternative treatments and clinical trials  Joanne will have to travel to see specialists we hope can offer new and more successful treatment options. We are asking for your help to get her the treatment she needs. We are asking because all we can do is support her and her family by alleviating some of the financial burdens of costly doctor’s appointments and medical treatments so their family may focus on the monumental endeavor of survival.When her son Cole asks what he can do because he feels like he is not doing enough for his mom  she tells him the best thing he can do for her is to focus on being a teenager. Keep his grades up  stick with extracurriculars  and live his best high school experience. Let’s help Cole live his best high school experience and do all we can to ensure his mom is there for his high school graduation  his college graduation and beyond. Thank you so much for donating. We have endless appreciation for your generosity under these most difficult of circumstances. #CancerCantKeepJoDown"

Katharine started to feel a little under the weather about a month ago. She shrugged it off  kept helping out with her family and non-profits. Under the weather became flu-like with some back pain. A close friend finally dragged her to the doctor. Sadly  it was not the flu.In the course of a month  Inflammatory Breast Cancer had moved rapidly from her breast to her lymph nodes to her liver and spine.  IBC is a very fast moving and aggressive cancer -a terrible foe. Katharine spent most of the last week in the ICU at Newton-Wellesley fighting for her life. She's through the first round of chemo  and her liver and kidneys are now fighting to clear her blood stream of the chemo and dead tumor cells. She'll be in the hospital until they catch up  and will face weeks of chemo ahead. IBC is generally pretty responsive to chemo  but Katharine has a huge fight ahead of her.We're hoping that you'll help pick up the fight with her. As many of you know  Katharine has worked for a variety of non-profits  trading the fulfillment of the work for the safety of a corporate job. Her work helping others doesn't come with those little insurance perks  like disability insurance  that are so incredibly helpful at a time like this.So this is our Crusade for Katharine. We're raising money to help pay the bills. Katharine has health insurance  but there will be deductibles  co-pays  rent  power  food  transportation etc.  and unfortunately being there for others doesn't pay a lot. I hope you'll be there for Katharine.*Note:* This campaign is run by Isabel Roberts  Katharine's daughter. All donations will be withdrawn by Isabel solely to to pay Katharine's rent  bills and medical expenses during this time."

"Medical","January 22, 2019","Help Breanne Beat Cancer","$20,787","$100,000","231","2","234","684","ATLANTA","GA","I woke up in the middle of the night lying in a pool of blood. That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am  as blood poured out of my body in sheets  a terrifying reality struck: I was alone  1200 miles from home  unemployed  without health insurance  and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home  near my family to face this crisis. So  I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later  I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once  I stopped to catch my breath  arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30  my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival  I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. \"I don’t belong here  I thought.\" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests  nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food  and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion ” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning  doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure  my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said  “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat  perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know ” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later  they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs  but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum  resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging  on December 18th  they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer  especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like  or what it feels like  or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase  but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place  unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration  and any amount remaining following an injection  is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore  according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called  The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies   “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival  BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy  some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight  which may or may not go away  hair loss  loss of appetite  nausea  unusual tiredness or fatigue  dizziness  “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation  brain fog  and cognitive impairment —which can last for years  changes in vision  sores in mouth or throat  diarrhea  vomiting  impaired immune system function  rash  hives  itching  difficulty breathing/swallowing  nosebleeds  coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!)  pink  red  or dark brown urine  unusual bleeding or bruising  and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer  so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old  but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs  therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression  loss of identity  and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug  doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs  which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo  approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning  even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test  Caris test). So  I asked my oncologist  who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately  if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take  but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy  visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil  the drug my doctor has prescribed for me  and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy  each 12 to 16-weeks long  I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects  high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation  my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries  five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea  rectal bleeding  bladder and vaginal irritation  redness and itching to the treated area  brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis)  sexual side effects  and incontinence—or more commonly  the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So  in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery  I get to wear an adult diaper  just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes  too?If you’re still reading at this point  perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is  yes  there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is  the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates  the father of modern medicine said  “first  do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus  I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books  Chris Beat Cancer   by Chris Wark  and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life   by David Servan-Schreiber  MD  PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside  one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed  but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But  since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food  whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice  and in less than a month  I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural  holistic  or alternative medicines in the United States  and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland  Greece  and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A  IV-vitamin C  IV-mistletoe  IV-curcumin  far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells  hyperbolic oxygen chamber  Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment  acupuncture  mind-body therapy  and many  many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer  healthier alternative to healing cancer  they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life  I’ve been called stupid  and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend  then I do not have their support. At times  I’ve never felt more alone. So  I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers  I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now  I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money  especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue  no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents  I now have insurance  but due to the circumstances of my health crisis  I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me  that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that  no matter what  I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive  least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you  I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar. Donate a word of advice or recommendation to a doctor. Forward my story to friends or someone you know that may be able to help. Share with me your stories of success and failure when you were battling your own illnesses. Say a prayer for my healing. I can’t promise I will ever be able to pay back the money I hope to raise  but I can promise to pay it forward. I can promise to be an advocate for health and nutrition; I can promise to keep you informed every step of the way; and I can promise to help the next person in line who finds themselves in my situation—terrified and fighting for her life with a glimmer of hope that toxic medicine isn’t the way to survival.

As you might know  Matt began his last semester at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach FL two weeks ago. He was very excited to be graduating magna cum laude in May and was looking forward to getting a great job in the aviation industry.On Friday  1/11  Matt was riding his motorcycle home from work as a teaching assistant at ERAU when a car cut him off  sending him flying more than 80 feet from the point of impact! He suffered two broken legs  a broken hand  a skull fracture and broke his back in two places.The other driver  a woman who was out of jail on bond for drug charges  was cited for the accident. Unfortunately she had no liability coverage and her insurance will pay only $10 000 of Matt’s medical costs. ... which is barely a drop in the bucket of what likely already exceeds $100 000. Matt’s student health insurance will pay some of the bills but there are loads of expenses that Matt’s family has already incurred with no end in sight.Matt is an amazing young man with a great future. Just as he has surmounted all kinds of difficulties —including his dad’s sudden death — in the past  he is determined to recover fully and return to ERAU in either the summer or the fall to finish his degree. But he needs help to meet the ever-rising expenses caused to him by no fault of his own.Those will include the cost of skilled nursing for a month or so to help him recuperate from his injuries enough to go into intensive inpatient rehabilitation and then the support he needs to transition home (probably in a wheelchair).His mom and brother have been in Florida since the day of the accident and are doing everything they can to help him as he heals from these awful injuries. We want to help them by raising $25 000 to meet some of Matt’s many related expenses including copays and deductibles.Lots of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help. The answer is yes: please donate here to  Matt Deckman's Recovery Fund. Then  you can \"like\" and \"share\" with your family and friends and ask them to lend a hand.

"Medical","March 6, 2019","Help Amanda fight Triple Negative Breast Cancer","$19,345","$16,500","175","1","174","830","JORDAN","MN","Just before Thanksgiving of this past year  our sister  Amanda Burton  shared the shocking news that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. After further testing  she was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: Stage IIIC Breast Cancer. PET scans showed that it had spread to her lymph nodes. Amanda has been diagnosed with a fairly rare and aggressive form  called Triple Negative. It was difficult to wrap our heads around her diagnosis  as Amanda is only 37  and has two young children (Jefferson - 6 years old  Lennon - 2 years old). Amanda is currently receiving her care through Minnesota Oncology and the Piper Breast Center in Minneapolis. Her particular subtype of breast cancer  Triple Negative  limits her treatment options. A diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer means that the three most common types of receptors known to fuel most breast cancer growth–estrogen  progesterone  and the HER-2/neu gene– are not present in the cancer. Since the tumor cells lack the necessary receptors  common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen  progesterone  and HER-2 are ineffective. Using chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer is still an effective option. In fact  triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in the earlier stages than many other forms of cancer. Amanda began chemotherapy at the end of November 2018 and should be wrapping up in April. After discovering some damage to her veins from the chemo infusion process  Amanda had surgery to insert a portacath (a device providing a direct line for infusions to a larger vein)  to ease the process and prevent additional damage. Her chemotherapy treatment consists of two phases and 16 total treatments. Post chemo  she will undergo additional imaging to determine the effectiveness of the chemo at reducing the known tumors. Based on the results of the imaging  doctor recommendations  and Amanda’s preferences she will have surgery. The preliminary surgical outlook is a mastectomy. While a chance exists that Amanda’s tumors will shrink enough for a lumpectomy  the likelihood of this less invasive procedure is limited  at best. After receiving a course ofradiation treatment  Amanda will undergo reconstructive surgeries  and a lifetime of ongoing testing to determine if her cancer is still in remission. Whereas no guarantee exists her treatments will cure Amanda’s cancer  her medical team is confident that she is on a path to recovery and optimistic that her outcome will be positive. This seems an entirely unfair experience for someone with such a loving  giving  and genuine heart (though we know that's not how the Universe works)! At the same time  we've never known a stronger  more determined fighter than Amanda  and are convinced she will conquer this  as well. Amanda has a supportive husband  Travis  and two amazing little boys that keep her battling each day. She is also blessed with a supportive network of friends as well as co-workers  and an extended family unit that is giving her love and support every step of the way. While there is little we can do to ease the physical and emotional toll of this experience  we are hoping to help Amanda with the intense financial burden that cancer has brought. Though Amanda does have health insurance  it doesn't begin to fully cover all the expenses. We would ideally like to raise $16 500. This money will go toward covering additional health insurance costs from out-of-pocket expenses  deductibles for the years 2018-2020 including but not limited to: chemotherapy  mastectomy and reconstruction  radiation  various oral medications  medical scans (PET  MRI  etc.)  and portacath surgery.  We are immensely grateful for any and all donations! We know that a financial gift is not possible for everyone  but hope you will consider sharing Amanda's story with your friends and networks. We'd love to meet our goal by the end of March to give Amanda an additional boost as she finishes chemotherapy treatment and begins the second phase of her road to recovery. We would also appreciate any prayers  love  and positive energy you could send her way!With love and gratitude Amanda's sisters  Emily Lewandowski & Molly Stangby     PS: GoFundMe no longer takes 5% of donations!

Jim was rushed to Boston Medical where he received lifesaving treatments  including a craniectomy to relieve the increasing pressure/swelling in his brain. In the early months  the goal was on helping Jim stay alive. After a month in a coma  Jim began to regain consciousness. By June  Jim's family was elated when he was accepted to Spaulding Rehab in Charlestown  where we all hoped he would progress enough to eventually regain enough function to allow him to return home to his wife  Krissy  and their 6 year old son  John. Unfortunately  only a few days into his stay at Spaulding  Jim became gravely ill with sepsis and pneumonia  and was quickly moved back to Boston Medical. The prognosis at that point was not good  and Jim's family began to prepare for the possibility that Jim may not survive the ordeal. Miraculously  his condition slowly began to turn around. His physical health improved enough to allow him to be discharged to Spaulding Cambridge  where he could receive intense medical and nursing attention and still participate in some rehab as he was able. Since then  Jim has made progress amidst setbacks. He is currently in a nursing facility in Milton  where he was transferred in November  after a number of months in Spaulding Cambridge. The progress he has made since early December has been incredible... he is able to stand with support for brief periods  he has tried to speak a bit more each day  and on a daily basis we see the \"Jim\" we know and love come back to us more and more. He smiles and laughs (and saves his biggest smiles for his son John). He and John play catch with a small football. It is so uplifting and heartwarming to watch. Unfortunately  now that Jim is at a point where physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech therapy are more critical than ever to ensure his continued progress  his health insurance company is refusing to pay for further therapy.  At this point  Krissy has been purchasing the equipment he needs at the nursing facility (from tracheotomoy caps to orthotic boots) out of her own pocket.Jim has always been a proud guy and has never liked asking for help. Out of respect for that  I have held off on creating this page. However  as the months go on and Jim's needs for therapy increase and his health insurance runs out  and as it becomes clearer that returning to work in the future is not something we can count on  I feel compelled to take action to help him  Krissy  and John in any tangible way I can. Krissy  in the midst of all of this upheaval  stress  uncertainty  and sadness in her own life  has amazingly found it in her heart to help other families in need and to devote her time to other charitable efforts. So many have stepped up to help in various ways in these past few months  and our family is eternally grateful for the support. The hope in this fundraising effort is to support Jim's family with his healthcare expenses and to relieve the financial burdens associated with Jim's condition."

At the time  she was told she was allergic to something in the air and therefore she didn’t think much about it. Two months ago  she visited her doctor to get checked for the possibility of skin cancer. Fortunately  there were no signs of skin cancer but it was this appointment where she brought up the lingering cough again to verify the “allergy”. The doctor recommended getting an X-ray and from there  multiple tests and procedures were performed over the past few months. Results finally came in on November 6th  and Bernice was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin’s Lymphoma at age 25.Treatment: Bernice currently is on medical leave on orders from her oncologist. Her first of six chemotherapy cycles was on November 27th and it went a lot better than anticipated. She is currently resting at home with minor side affects and a good appetite. After the fourth cycle in January  a PET scan will be done to re-evaluate if radiation would be needed after chemo.Funds: Bernice is not under her parents’ insurance since both have limited employment.

She is an Afro-Latina woman from Puerto Rico and has been the Executive Director of Mothers on the Move for nearly 2 decades. Her unwavering commitment to poor  disenfranchised people of color has been a staple of her commitment to our movements and served as a source of inspiration for countless folks like me.  When people  communities  or organizations have needed support  Wanda often has been the first person to show up  selflessly offering herself and whatever resources were available to her at the time. She has never been one to offer support and leave. For so many  she provides support and sticks around until a sustainable transformation occurs that allows her to move onto the next person or organization that needs authentic love and support.  We call her Wanda Woman because it is a moniker she has worked towards her entire life.WHY YOUR HELP MATTERSWhile Wanda’s story of leadership and power may be a unique story amongst movement leaders  being a woman of color  underpaid  and without health insurance is a far too common story we hear.  In typical Wanda fashion  when the ED of an organization was diagnosed with cancer  Wanda stepped into the Interim Director role to ensure the work and the team of that organization continued to be supported  without interruption. And it cost her — big time. For months  Wanda pushed herself  running two organizations and supporting two teams and many communities. And finally  almost a month ago  the stress and sheer magnitude of work  caught up to her and hit her hard.  Wanda has been hospitalized for extreme physical exhaustion that has deeply wounded her mentally  physically  and spiritually. Now  more than ever before  she needs us. She needs all of us. YOUR SUPPORT IS ABOUT HEALINGAfter 40 years of unrelenting movement dedication and work  and the recent life-altering event that has forced Wanda (and all of us) to take toll of the real cost of doing social change work  Wanda needs a real sabbatical to heal physically  mentally  and spiritually. Our bodies are not machines  and it will scream at us to stop and take care  even when we refuse to listen. And life presents us with many opportunities to understand the vital lessons are bodies force us to learn.  Your support offers time for Wanda to heal  while simultaneously providing you a chance to take part in the learning this life lesson has to offer us. Will you join us in supporting Wanda’s much-needed healing by helping us raise money to:·      Allow Wanda to stop working for five months and get her healing on  truly.·      Cover her rent and living costs for this period ·      Support Wanda to return home  to Puerto Rico  where her elders and family can care for her and so she may heal from the ocean.·      Provide Wanda with holistic and integral health practices  including healing foods and programs. DEEP BOW OF GRATITUDEAny support you can offer  whether through donating or sharing this fundraiser  means so much to so many  especially Wanda.  Your support begins by helping Wanda take time to heal trulyand carries over to all the folks and communities Wanda will no doubt resume supporting once she returns to her life’s purpose and work.  For your support  whatever it may be  we are deeply grateful.With much love and appreciation Marcia OlivoZaida SalamanRusia MohiuddinMaria MohiuddinJanvieve Williams- Comrie"

I don't have health insurance and  3 days ago I had surgery to remove the necrotic flesh that is spreading inside of my leg. The surgery was a failure and also simultaneously bankrupted me.  The incision in my leg has burst open and There is now new necrotic dying flesh growing in my leg.   In this time of incredible physical and emotional suffering any donation no matter how small to help me to afford my upcoming surgeries to save my leg is something I will be eternally grateful for. The first surgery was paid out of pocket and was in the area of 10 thousand dollars. I have at least 2 more surgeries I need but do not have financial means to pay for them.  These surgeries will also be more costly than the first. Please help me  please share this on every social media you have. I have no where to turn. - Dan Marquis \"bodybuilder in Thailand\""

He has spent the past week at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN where doctors are still perplexed. The closest thing to a diagnosis is that Spencer's e-coli infection from December of last year has left his nervous system in over drive. Spencer's unknown illness prompts episodes of elevated heart rate (almost 200 beats per minutes at times)  inability to breath  and muscle failure due to lactic acid build up. Multiple times he has collapsed simply trying to walk from the car to the house and had to be taken to the emergency room. In addition to this  his symptoms now include mental confusion and the inability to walk more than just a short distance.Spencer is unable to work during this time and as a result has lost his health insurance. He cannot be added to my parent's insurance as he is over the age of 26.  While he does have insurance through the state of Massachusetts  this insurance does not cover out of state costs at specialty hospitals such as the Mayo Clinic where he is now.The Mayo Clinic has recommended that Spencer receive treatment  focused on resetting his entire nervous system.  This includes physical and occupational therapy  and even cognitive behavior adjustments. The bulk of the funds raised here will go to funding the related costs for this program. Unfortunately this program costs around $50 000 in addition to the 10's of thousand my parents have already spent .Unfortunately  my family simply does not have this amount of money to spare at this time. We are asking for your help. Any amount will help and be greatly appreciated. Let's help Spencer get back on his feet and on the pathway to a normal life. Cheers Matt"

Ann was recently diagnosed with a condition called hyperparathyroid disease. She is scheduled to have surgery on February 13th at the Norman Parathyroid Center in Tampa  Florida. This center is the world's leading treatment center dedicated to hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid surgery. They will be removing one or more tumors from Ann's parathyroid glands. Unfortunately  the Norman Parathyroid Center does not accept Ann’s health insurance. She has explored other hospitals and doctors that do this procedure  but there are risks involved  as they do not have the expertise and technology that this center has available. Their website states  “About 10% of our practice is on patients who had a failed operation somewhere else  and about a third of them have lost their voice.” Clearly  the best option is for Ann to have her surgery at this Center.So dear relatives  this request is to ask for your help to open the path for healing for our dear Ann. Your prayers and financial support are deeply appreciated at a time that has been somewhat stressful for Ann and Bob. It is our prayer that she receives the best care and treatment available so that the gift of her voice and health is not compromised in any way.Thank you for your support and prayers! #TeamAnn________________________________________________________ FOLLOWING IS AN OUTLINE OF THE IMMEDIATE GOAL:Surgery:  $14 000Transportation (air & ground)  lodging  diet  and miscellaneous expenses: $4 500✩ TOTAL: $18 500________________________________________________________ Below is a 6-minute video link describing hyperparathyroid disease and the procedure: Below are a few words of gratitude from Ann:Dear friends and relations I am so grateful.The Holy One continues to humble me  and allow me to fulfill my heart-of-hearts prayer to be in loving service.This fall  through routine blood tests  I found I have a condition called hyperparathyroid disease. Further tests and x-rays have shown I have at least one tumor in my neck  which needs to be removed.

We are asking for your help to finance Ted’s ongoing recovery from stage 3A lung cancer.My dad is equal parts watchful and goofy; hardworking and adventurous; strong and humble. He is an amazing dad  a loving husband  and a family chef most people only dream about!He is also a dedicated Chicago Public School teacher. Last summer  my dad was diagnosed with Stage 3A lung cancer. He started chemotherapy and radiation treatments right away in an effort to shrink the baseball-sized tumor in his right lung with surgery to follow.We were very lucky. The radiation and chemotherapy treatments worked as the doctors hoped  however  the last two rounds of chemo were very difficult for Ted. He lost a lot of weight and much of his strength. Still  our team of doctors at Rush were very hopeful that Ted would recover.In October  Ted underwent surgery to remove the tumor  a portion of his right lung  as well as several ribs. He came home shortly thereafter  but quickly returned to the hospital when complications arose. Ted was struggling to breathe and experiencing dizziness  nausea  and anxiety. Residual effects from his chemotherapy treatments persisted. We learned that Ted had pneumonia and empyema (a collection of pus in the lung cavity)  along with a gastrointestinal infection. Over the course of the next several weeks  Ted’s doctors worked to save what remained of his right lung  which involved daily  painful bronchoscopies. Ultimately  the medical team decided to remove the lung in order to avoid infection in his left  healthy lung.Shortly after my dad’s pneumonectomy (surgery to remove his lung)  he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. It was latent  non-infectious tuberculosis  likely contracted prior to his cancer diagnosis which became active when his immune system was compromised. He continues to be treated for tuberculosis  but is no longer infectious.Ted’s recovery has been unbelievably difficult. Since November  he has lived life from various hospital and rehabilitation beds. He has a catheter  and a feeding tube to nourish his deconditioned body while he learns how to swallow without food aspirating into his remaining lung. At 6 feet tall  he weighs just slightly more than 130 pounds. He is relearning to walk  write  shave  use the toilet  and breathe efficiently. Every day  his chest cavity is unpacked and re-packed from a 3” x 4” opening under his armpit  the goal being for the entire chest cavity to heal from the inside out. He completes daily intensive speech/swallow therapy  occupational therapy  and physical therapy.Here is a photo of my dad now  smiling as he works in speech therapy. My mom visits him every day. She does his PT and OT homework with him and encourages him to try new mushed up foods. She grades her classroom papers from his bedside while rubbing his legs.Very soon  my dad will have maxed out his health insurance coverage for his rehabilitation stay  and he will come home. When he does  he will need considerable  costly support  as the setbacks he has encountered in this season have significantly delayed his healing. While we expect that things like wound care supplies  a standard wheelchair  and a commode will be covered by insurance  we know that a whole range of things  like physical  occupational  and speech therapy  will not. Clare  my mom  will be responsible for wound care  tube feedings  catheter maintenance  and more. Family and friends will be pitching in  too.Also  this summer  Clare and Ted’s insurance situation is likely to change. My dad will go on Medicare and my mom will need to pay for a comprehensive health insurance policy (she does not receive health benefits as an adjunct faculty member at Columbia College).As we navigate this next chapter of my dad’s recovery  we recognize the financial challenges that lay ahead and we find ourselves in the position of needing to ask for help. We do not do so lightly.FINANCIAL NEEDS BREAKDOWN:In-home nursing care -  $750/ week for 50 Weeks =  $37 500Oxygen -  estimating $400/month won't be covered by insurance. Twelve months = $4 800Uncovered medical bills up to this point = $10 000 Therapies uncovered by insurance  annually = $21 600 Home uncovered medical supplies and future surgery = $10 000 Clare's regular insurance  plus Ted's Medicare & supplement through Chicago Teachers’ Union = $19 200 Yearly : $143 000On top of that  insurance is trying to not pay for radiation at this point - an extra $136 000 for a standard of cancer care.  No question about it - we will be fighting this tooth and nail.I know there are some things I should not expect to be able to do with my dad again. I don’t know if we’ll be able to walk in nature together or go for a drive or visit garage sales. But the real ask here is to help us build a good life without those things. A life where Ted can breathe more easily and laugh and use his body independently  and mom can go to work knowing that my dad is receiving essential care and establish a sense of balance that will sustain her in the long-term.We are so grateful to the friends  family  and healthcare professionals that have supported us thus far. We have been held up by people’s good thoughts  meditations  and prayers  and we continue to ask for those. If you are able  a donation of any amount would be greatly appreciated by our family as Ted’s recovery continues.Here are photos of Ted in nature - which is what he loves almost as much as we love him. And in the kitchen cooking - which he does to show his love for us.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:Do you have a medical or nursing background? Sign up for shifts to watch Ted when he first comes home before we have the funds to hire someone!Do you have law experience appealing insurance denials? We would love your advice.Please email charlottebritta@gmail.com if you can help in either of these ways."

He is truly a servant who cares deeply and loves deeply – always putting others first. He has faithfully performed at benefit shows – too many to count – and gives sacrificially. However - over the years - the grind and pace of his life has taken its toll on him.  While caring for so many others he neglected himself. Many of us know Omar as the leader of the premier and award-winning Memphis reggae band Chinese Connection Dub Embassy. He is also the founder and leader of the new four-piece award-winning powerhouse hardcore punk band Negro Terror. Omar and CCDE are also Ambassadors for Musicians for Le Bonheur  which helps raise money for the children at Le Bonheur Hospital. Omar is also a church youth leader  praise team music director and college student with just one class remaining to finish his degree. He loves Memphis and everything it stands for but most of all he loves people just as much as he loves his Maker and his family.Two weeks ago - Omar was having bad flu-like symptoms and was feverish and was also having severe back pain. Being Omar  he was set on pushing on through two live shows and his three Sunday church service gigs. After the first-morning church service  Omar did not realize his body was beginning to shut down on him – he was still thinking the pain and flu-like symptoms were from a pinched nerve in his back. After getting home he laid down on the floor and literally did not get up for almost a full week - daily promising his brothers that he would be better soon. Omar was not getting better and towards the end of the week seemed to be acting strange – not like himself and not making sense when he spoke. David and Joseph had seen enough and called 911. Paramedics came to the house and took him by ambulance to the hospital. He was immediately admitted to ICU at Methodist Hospital downtown and was diagnosed with a mini-stroke and a staph infection that docs determined came from a sore on his back. On top of the infection and neurological damage - Omar has suffered kidney damage from the antibiotics and other meds. All of this trauma then caused his body to go into crisis mode and he began to retain fluids – which has put him in an incredibly dangerous and life-threatening situation. Many of you have been praying for Omar  his family and the doctors and nurses who have been doing all they can to save his life. The good news is those prayers are moving the hand of God and Omar is starting to make a turn for the better but he is still very far from being out of the woods. He is now on day 10 in the ICU at Methodist Hospital and will need to continue on the antibiotics to fight the staph infection. He will soon begin physical therapy to walk again and will soon have a complete life change needing to adhere to a strict diet which will provide improved long term health & healing. Omar – sadly like so many professional musicians in Memphis - has no health insurance. Even when he does get out of the hospital - he will continue to need meds and will be transferred to a live-in rehab facility. As I am sure you have already been thinking – his medical bills will be overwhelming! This is where we come in… please join us in helping Omar get back to doing what he loves and was born to do through his life and music - and that's to love  teach and serve so many here in Memphis. We are so blessed to have Omar in our lives as he has given so much to all of us  – now it’s our chance and our privilege to give back to him. We can do this – GO TEAM OMAR! TIME TO ROCK THIS AND ROCK IT HARD!"

Yeah... I’m not sure  either!￼The Long StoryLast January I dedicated  my 33rd year to prioritizing my health and my mind. In February I started a new job as a women's health social worker in Pittsburgh while continuing to teach yoga in the evenings. March left me with a fibromyalgia diagnosis. I began a treatment plan in April that included physical & occupational therapy  medication management  talk therapy  and weekly appointments. Prompted by my family’s medical history  I elected to undergo genetic cancer screening in June. I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer when I was 23 (2018 was the 10th anniversary of his passing)  as well as his mother and her three sisters to breast cancer before they reached the age of 45. ￼￼My screen revealed a BRCA2 gene mutation  which prompted mammogram #1 on September 15th & recall mammogram #2 on September 27th. Round two uncovered abnormal imaging and cued biopsies on each side. Sierra and I were scheduled to leave one day later for our vacation  where we would become engaged. I was advised to schedule my first biopsy for the Monday following our return. While at home recovering from that biopsy  I  was laid off from my job and informed that I would lose my health insurance at the end of that month. The pathology results came back four days later. ￼￼It's cancer. Despite all of the questions that have come up  I'm certain that I need to accept a new reality. I'll be unable to secure employment until I recover from my bilateral mastectomy  reconstruction  radiation  and possible chemotherapy. I turned 34 two days after surgery. My fertility doctor prescribed back-to-back cycles of hormone injections and egg retrievals in order to expedite the IVF process for my fiance and I. All of the above-mentioned procedures cost as much in dollars as they do time and sanity  yet are necessary in order to mitigate the side effects of treatment and give me any sort of chance at having kids in the future. This will all be in addition to the general cost of living a life  of course. Sort of like a  \"Bi*ch-I-know-cancer-is-extra\"  type of situation.￼￼I’ve always prided myself on being an independent  “I-can-do-it-myself” type of woman. It goes without saying that it’s entirely out of my comfort zone to ask for help. My new reality has shown me that this type of pride can be driven by poor self-worth and shame. In the past  I’ve sacrificed plenty of comfort zones in an effort to impact and be impacted by this big  beautiful  wild world. So  fuck it...  GOODBYE COMFORT ZONE ￼               I have cancer and I need your help. My family needs your help.  Every cent counts right now and each one means more than I can convey.

En estos momentos  se encuentra en una situación médica grave y desesperada. A finales de febrero de este año el seguro de PDVSA fue suspendido sin aviso ni consideración  por lo que Ricardo se encuentra desamparado y sin cobertura médica a pesar de ser beneficiario de este.   El día 3 de marzo del año en curso  Ricardo viajó a España a visitar a su hijo y a conocer a sus nietos de dos y un año  quienes a raíz de la diáspora venezolana se encuentran en ese país. El 5 de marzo Ricardo presentó una pérdida súbita del conocimiento y una convulsión por lo que fue llevado al hospital y al hacerle estudios se encontró una lesión en el cerebro cuyas características hicieron pensar en una metástasis.

Ricardo was part of the team that created a health insurance for all the workers in that company.

Currently he is in a serious and desperate medical situation and doesn’t have medical coverage despite being one of its beneficiaries.On March 3 of this year  Ricardo traveled to Spain to visit his son and to meet his grandchildren aged two and one year old who  as a result of the Venezuelan diaspora  live there. On March 5 Ricardo lost consciousness and had a seizure so he was taken to the hospital; after some studies  a lesion was found in the brain whose characteristics suggested a metastasis. Now we know that Ricardo has lung cancer and a brain metastasis  which was surgically removed in an emergency.At this moment Ricardo is hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Defensa Gómez Ulla in Madrid  without insurance and without any means to cover the expenses related to surgery and the treatment he needs to fight cancer. For this reason  we are asking for your help and collaboration.

Due to her specialized condition  some appointments are local  and some are a plane ride away.  As a result of her significant gross motor  fine motor and speech delays  the little amount of free time she does have looks quite different than her peers. Madeline doesn’t find enjoyment in normal activities for kids her age.  Simple things like playing with toys  working on a puzzle or even playing make believe are not possible because her brain simply doesn’t work that way….yet.  Instead of winding down each evening by learning how to properly brush her teeth  Madeline needs to be held down by one parent while the other one brushes.  This may sound like a kid who simply doesn’t behave  however that assumption couldn’t be farther from the truth.  This behavior is related to an inability of her sensory system to tolerate the feeling of a toothbrush in her mouth.  As you could imagine  Madeline’s biggest frustration is her inability to express herself in a way that other people  including her own family  can understand.  Because she has been diagnosed with both Autism and apraxia  a motor planning disorder  verbal communication is extremely difficult.   Despite all of this  Madeline remains to be a positive and extremely happy little girl.  Due to her amazing strength  she relentlessly pushes herself every day in the hope to make her current world a distant memory.      By the age of three  Madeline was attending 32 hours of therapy sessions per week in addition to her 10 hours of preschool.  She has undergone multiple surgeries and has been diagnosed with several disorders / conditions explaining her developmental delays.  Her primary diagnosis is Autism.  Given Madeline’s therapy schedule and treatment plan  putting my career on hold became a must.  As her mom  I wanted to be there every step of the way and provide every single opportunity for her to reach her full potential.     Despite our steadfast commitment to her physical and cognitive development  her progress has been slow.  We are tirelessly looking for opportunities to give Madeline the best chance at a normal life.  Our search has led us to Stem Cell Therapy  which involves using stem cells harvested from the cord and placentas of healthy born babies.   After reading multiple clinical studies from high profile universities like Duke  along with talking to numerous doctors and parents in similar situations  many of our hopes for Madeline seem very possible using Stem Cell treatments.  We are very optimistic that with multiple rounds of treatments  along with continued intense therapy  we will see the efforts of Madeline’s hard work start to pay off. Unfortunately  Stem Cell Therapy comes at a significant cost  which is currently not offset by health insurance.  Having already spent tens of thousands of dollars on continuous therapies and visits to her doctors  we find ourselves in a financial situation where the funds for stem cell treatment simply aren’t there. One Stem Cell Treatment  along with the required intensive therapy  comes at a cost of $12 000.  Based on discussions with families currently utilizing stem cells  we know that one round of treatment will not result in a cure or even provide Madeline with the maximum benefits.  Our goal is simple; to give Madeline the very best shot at one day having normal life where she can be a contributing member of society and have lasting friendships. To have any chance of realizing this dream  she will have to undergo multiple treatments.     Throughout this journey we have heard stories about hundreds of incredibly kind and generous people who have been instrumental in assisting with the treatment of many children with the same challenges as our little girl.  It is because of these stories that we made this humbling decision to ask for help as well.  This is a moment that each parent has experienced.  A moment to swallow your pride and ask for the help you need to give your child an opportunity to be the best person he or she could be.  It is with this spirit that we ask for your help in raising the funds required for Madeline to receive this Stem Cell Therapy. Our goal is to raise $60 000 to provide a minimum of five rounds of treatment for Madeline.  We know it is going to require an incredible amount of donations to make this goal a reality.  We hope you will consider even a small donation as every dollar makes a difference.  Please know that all support is incredibly appreciated.  Lastly  we hope you will consider sharing our little girl’s story with your network as well.  Only by sharing Madeline’s story will we be able to make this type of grass roots effort a success.  Thank you for taking the time to read about Madeline’s journey.  In addition  thank you for any support that you can offer in our time of need."

He has lived a life of service to others by volunteering to numerous religious and non-for-profit organizations. Even with all his activities and busy schedule Jose always finds time to let his friends know that he cares about them  it can be thru a phone call  a text or a quick little visit just to say “Hello”.  Jose is never too busy to lend a helping hand to one that needs it  even if he himself is in need of help. He is selfless  service minded  oozes with happiness  has a strong faith in God  he is committed and extremely responsible. Jose is just a superb human being.WHAT HAPPENED?Unfortunately  even the nicest of people have bad things happen to them.  On the evening of January 15  2019 Jose was not feeling at this best  he was weak and disoriented and felt as if he was going to pass out.  He had just enough energy to call a friend and ask him to please take him to the hospital. They barely made it and he had to be wheeled in as he was rapidly losing consciousness. After treating him and running a series of in-depth testing the test results came back positive for colon cancer.  The tests also revealed several dark spots on his liver which confirmed that the cancer had metastasized; He was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.SECOND OPINIONHe immediately looked for a second opinion at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America  in Zion IL. hoping it was all a big mix-up and he did not have a such a serious illness. He was admitted to the Center on Wednesday  January 23  2019 for an intense 3 day evaluation. The Center ran additional tests and confirmed the original diagnosis  he had stage 4 colon cancer.  At this point time was of the essence and both Jose and his doctors decided that the best thing for Jose was to start with his treatment as soon as possible. The chemo sessions were scheduled to last for a period of three months and at the end of the three months another evaluation would take place and dictate the next steps. Unfortunately  Jose had some complications over the weekend which resulted in Jose having to have an emergency surgery to extract the cancerous tumor  chemotherapy was now postponed after full recovery.COMPLICATIONSThe recovery from the surgery was supposed to be uneventful  he was to be released in a couple of days and go home to recover for 4 to 6 weeks. Sadly  that was not the case; a couple of days after the surgery Jose was told that he was retaining fluids and he needed to stay in observation just to be safe.  As his luck will have it  a second emergency surgery needed to be performed  he had developed an acute infection in his stomach. This was a major set back on his recovery  now Jose has to recover from two different surgeries. Even with all the complications Jose always keeps a positive attitude and thanks God for giving him one more day to live. Once he recovers from the two surgeries  the doctors will be able to re-evaluate him and decide when he is ready to start chemotherapy to treat the spots found on his liver and to prevent any further spread of the cancerous cells.URGENT NEEDIt’s been over a month since Jose stopped working and bills started to pile up including rent  utilities and all the medical expenses that the health insurance in not covering. This GoFundMe page was created to help Jose alleviate some of that burden so he can fully concentrate only on his health  and get back to being the person we all know and love. Any contribution big or small will make a difference to help lessen the financial stress for him and his family. This is the beginning of a long road ahead and all the funds contributed will help him directly now and through his recovery.YOU CAN HELP!It is heartbreaking to see Jose in such delicate state. There are moments of agony and yet even in the middle of the despair Jose is not giving up  he is truly fighting for his life.  Even the greatest warriors need a guiding light  perhaps together we can be a little ray of sunshine for Jose in the middle of this massive storm.

Después de tratarlo y realizar una serie de pruebas a profundidad  los resultados de la prueba dieron positivo de cáncer de colon. Las pruebas también revelaron varias manchas oscuras en su hígado que confirmaron que el cáncer había hecho metástasis; Fue diagnosticado con cáncer de colon en etapa 4.SEGUNDA OPINIONInmediatamente buscó una segunda opinión en los Centros de Tratamiento del Cáncer de América  en Zion IL. esperando que todo fuera una gran confusión y que no tuviera una enfermedad tan grave. Fue admitido en el Centro el miércoles 23 de enero de 2019 para una evaluación intensa de 3 días. El Centro realizó pruebas adicionales y confirmó el diagnóstico original  tenía cáncer de colon en etapa 4. En este punto  el tiempo era esencial y tanto José como sus médicos decidieron que lo mejor para José era comenzar con su tratamiento lo antes posible. Las sesiones de quimioterapia estaban programadas para durar un período de tres meses y al final de los tres meses se llevaría a cabo una evaluación de los siguientes pasos. Desafortunadamente  José tuvo algunas complicaciones durante ese fin de semana  lo que provocó que José tuviera que someterse a una cirugía de emergencia para extraer el tumor canceroso; la quimioterapia se pospuso para después de la recuperació de la cirugía.COMPLICACIONESSe suponía que la recuperación de la cirugía pasaría sin incidentes  se daría de alta en un par de días y se iría a casa para recuperarse durante 4 a 6 semanas. Lamentablemente  ese no fue el caso; Un par de días después de la cirugía  se le dijo a José que estaba reteniendo líquidos y que necesitaba permanecer en observación para asegurarse que todo marchara bien. No fue su suerte  se necesitó una segunda cirugía de emergencia ya que se había desarrollado una infección aguda en el estómago. Este fue un gran retroceso en su recuperación  ahora José tiene que recuperarse de dos cirugías diferentes.Incluso con todas las complicaciones  José siempre mantiene una actitud positiva y agradece a Dios por darle un día más para vivir. Una vez que se recupere de las dos cirugías  los médicos podrán evaluarlo y decidir cuándo está listo para comenzar la quimioterapia para tratar el cáncer que se encuentran en su hígado y prevenir una mayor propagación de las células cancerosas.NECESIDAD URGENTEHa pasado más de un mes desde que José dejó de trabajar y las facturas comenzaron a acumularse  incluyendo la renta  las utilidades  y todos los gastos médicos que el seguro de salud no cubre. Esta página de GoFundMe se creó para ayudar a José a aliviar algo de esa carga para que pueda concentrarse completamente en su salud y volver a ser la persona que todos conocemos y queremos. Cualquier contribución grande o pequeña hará una diferencia para ayudar a disminuir el estrés financiero para él y su familia. Este es el comienzo de un largo camino por delante y todos los fondos aportados lo ayudarán directamente ahora y durante su recuperación.¡TU PUEDES AYUDAR!Es desgarrador ver a José en tan delicado estado. Hay momentos de agonía y  sin embargo  incluso en medio de la desesperación  José no se da por vencido  está luchando por su vida. Incluso los guerreros más grandes necesitan una luz de guía  quizás juntos podamos ser un pequeño rayo de sol para José en medio de esta tormenta masiva. Cuando contribuyas  por favor piensa en la bondad y el amoroso corazón de José por los demás.Gracias por su generosidad y que muchas bendiciones vengan en su camino."

Long story short  by age 12 the disease clogged her liver so badly that she needed a liver transplant. It took 8 months before hers arrived.  Her last 10 days of waiting were spent in the ICU on life support.  She was 2 days away from the medical team having to pose the question “When do we pull the plug?”When she woke from the surgeries she could not talk  she could not walk  and she barely had any control of any motor functions.  She could not even hold her head up on her own.  She was like a preteen zombie  and would have to relearn all of those things.  We DID know  that inside that brain of hers  she was all there (she proved that to us)  she just could not get her body to do the things that come naturally to us all.  ALL the doctors were flabbergasted.  They did not expect any of this.  There was no script for what was happening  and how to deal with it  or what the outcome would be.After 30 days in the ICU (at $125 000 per day)  she moved to a regular ward in the hospital  and the hard work began.  It would be another month before she was out.  It would be another 3 months before she was in the clear.  As in the clear as could be at the time.Fast forward Here’s the thing.  I had ALL of that pretty much covered!  I had diligently worked with the hospitals accounting team  and all of the insurance companies involved to get nearly all of those costs covered.  The premiums were costly  as well as the missed work  but if that is all we had to deal with  well  that was manageable.  They had given us the script of how this would go and we followed it.  I didn't do any fund raisers at the time  because we didn't NEED them at the time.But  things didn't go according to script.  Yay  you have a new healthy liver.  Go home and have a great life!  But that’s not how it went. The physical cost in saving that body was greater than any book they had.  Twenty one IV lines streaming life saving medication  and actively dying for an extended period of time came at a great cost to her body.  That cost for her is joint deteriorating osteoarthritis  and the bone density of an 80 year old woman.  At the age of 17 she had a full hip replacement surgery.  The ball joint looked like a piece of cauliflower.  Just recently  she broke the second toe on her right foot.  How?  By running in gym class. How she was walking just before the hip replacement a year ago.The financial costPremiums for health insurance when you work for a small company are huge.  There aren't choices.  You get the plan they pick  and that is all.  These plans come with astronomical deductibles and out of pocket expenses.  All told  you could buy a brand new car EVERY.SINGLE.YEAR.  This does not even include the things insurance does NOT cover  or all the missed time from work for appointments.I’m that guy.  I’m the guy who makes a middle to upper middle class income  and can’t afford the insurance costs that my daughter so desperately needs.  I live in a modest 2 000 sq ft. ranch home with a mortgage payment less than what many families pay in rent.   I drive a 2003 Toyota Corolla with 235 000 miles on it.  I don’t have the latest anything.  I don’t go on vacations.  All of my furnishings are hand-me-downs.  98% of my clothes are 10 years old or older.  My retirement savings is gone.I’m a 53 year old divorced single father of 3 wonderful and amazing children who I cherish every day  and I am in debt up to my eyeballs because of medical related expenses  and my current employment will be ending soon.  In just 2 years I went from being just a little behind of where one my age probably “should” be financially  to asking “what the hell happened?” To be clear: Our medical bills are almost all paid.  However  to do this  I have had to incur other debt to satisfy those bills.As the dad  you’re supposed to handle this.  You are supposed to be the rock that they can count on.  I’m the person who is the giver  not the asker.  This is an incredibly humbling request I make now.I know that this is no small task  but we have faced “no small task” a few times now and prevailed.  Your generous gift will have the honor of lifting this financial burden that no one in the richest country in the world should ever have to face.  A burden I have been bearing and hiding all too long.I cannot thank you all enough for all the support!  With Love and Peace to all. ~ Rick"

Well the man happened to be our classmate and friend Keith Oakes  Class of ‘74  from Bethlehem Central. Keith  aka “Oakie” was a friend to many of us. Most of us have not seen nor heard from him in a very long time. https://wnyt.com/news/boy-helps-stranger-in-wheelchair-get-home-during-snowstorm-josh-cuzdey-colonie-albany-county/5147944/ He has had some hard times recently  which we think require some action on our part. He was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer. He was operated on last year  and during his recovery  he developed a blood clot in his leg which required amputation to save his life. You might remember Keith as a superb athlete who played Varsity Baseball and Basketball. He made it look easy. I recently took Keith out to breakfast  and although his current living arrangements are not the most desirable  he was upbeat and pretty nimble.Hard times can fall upon any of us. Keith is trying to move forward with these recent setbacks  but additionally his new wheelchair was stolen. He is currently using a second hand chair that does not meet his needs. He is also currently homeless and is awaiting possible placement in a social services apartment that is wheelchair accessible. These apartments don’t grow on trees at social services reimbursement rates. I will be meeting with his caseworker very soon to see what Keith’s options are. In the meantime  let’s do something now do it quickly  but do it right. We are not looking to put Keith up in the Ritz Carlton for the rest of his life. We are looking to help him secure a proper wheelchair  and an apartment that is safe  secure and  foremost  meets his adaptive needs. Eventually  Keith will be getting a prosthetic leg that should be fully covered under his insurance  but it might not cover possible additional fitting needs.We are proposing a “Go Fund Me” account that will be administered by myself (Jon Maskin) and fellow friends and classmates Terry Tipple and Bob Rooney. We will ensure all donations go for Keith’s welfare. Our hope is to help with rental needs that exceed Social Security benefits  and assist with his local transportation needs  and of course provide updates to wheel chair and other adaptive equipment he might need that exceeds his SSI and health insurance.Below is the Go Fund Me information  along with the video seen locally on both channels 10 and 13 in Albany. Please pass this on to all relevant people you might feel that can help. I will provide updates on Social Media. Facebook etc. My email is Adkjonny@gmail.com if you have any questions. We wish you Happy Holidays! And let’s try to make Keith’s one that he will remember. We will call ourselves the “Oakes Tree”Peace to you all. Our best  Jon  Bob and Terry"

I know him as my partner  roommate  cat co-parent  and best friend.After work on July 27th  Ryan left home for a motorcycle ride. Less than 10 minutes in  he was hit by a car and taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for emergency surgery. Ryan was conscious for the entire accident. He remembers being hit  flying through the air  landing on the grass on the opposite side of the street  and looking down to see his crushed foot and ankle.Within a week of his accident  he had to make the difficult decision to amputate his left leg below the knee over the other option  which was to suffer through a life of chronic pain with the inability to walk. Ryan chose the option that allows him to get back to playing in his band  work jobs that require mobility  and who knows  maybe run again someday. On August 2nd  he had his third and final surgery to amputate his left leg. Since being released after a second week in the hospital  he has been regaining his strength and just recently started to learn how to walk with his first prosthetic leg.Ryan's doctors have told him that as an amputee  he will need a new prosthetic leg every year for the next several years  and every one to three years after that. If he wants to run or pursue another more demanding activity  he will need additional prosthetics. These cost between $25 000 and $50 000 each and health insurance will only cover or partially cover what they deem \"medically necessary.\"Those of you who know Ryan know that he moves through the world in his own very special way. He dances into the room  high kicks to celebrate small wins  and (in my opinion) has the best dance moves out of everyone in his band. Ryan has a hard time asking for help  so I'm asking on his behalf so he can get back to having the jump in his step that he's always had.

Your contribution and support for Kali during this difficult time is deeply appreciated. On December 27th Kali was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. This completely changed her life. In order to focus on what has become the biggest challenge she has ever faced  she is taking time off from work and essentially putting her life on hold. Coming to terms with breast cancer at the age of 32 is challenging to say the least. Minnesota has a great health care system  and Kali is confident in her treatment plan. She enrolled in an immunotherapy clinical study  which has given her access to cutting edge treatments and further testing. These tests include MRIs  CTs  and PET scans. The results from the first set of scans confirmed that the cancer is stage 2b. While still an aggressive form of cancer  it thankfully has not spread to any other areas of her body.Kali had her first chemotherapy infusion on January 28th  and these treatments will continue for 22 weeks. Following chemo  she will have surgery in August to remove the tumor and breast tissue. This surgery will likely be a full or partial mastectomy to reduce any chance of recurrence. There will be a recovery period after surgery  which may be followed by radiation therapy depending on further test results. Hormonal treatment is the last step and will continue for an undetermined length of time. Kali is fortunate to have health insurance to help pay for most of the medical costs associated with treatment; however  her monthly health insurance costs have increased. She has medical and pharmaceutical deductibles to pay  and other parts of this process that are not covered by insurance. These include fertility treatments  genetic counseling  and unforeseen additional costs. As there was no immediate family history of breast cancer until now  genetic counseling is especially important. It will help doctors determine which surgery will be most appropriate  and provide invaluable information to the other women in Kali’s family. Facing these financial burdens while battling cancer feels overwhelming. The money from this fund will provide financial relief in a challenging time. Kali’s friends can attest: Kali is one of the most caring  adventurous  supportive  and wise people you’ll ever meet. We have no doubt she’ll win this battle  but your help would mean a lot as she navigates this challenge. She can’t wait to return to happier times of hiking  traveling  and spending quality time with her friends and family. Any donation amount helps. Kali is so grateful for all the amazing people in her life. Thank you all  and we love you!2/13/19 Edit: Gofundme asked for further details. This gofundme was written by Kali’s friends and her husband  Sean Campbell  who posted this page. Kali and Sean live in St. Paul  Minnesota  about an hour north of where Kali grew up in Rochester. Kali studied abroad in Australia in 2008  where she met Sean  and moved there after she finished college. They were married in 2011. After spending 6 years in Australia (where Sean is from) they moved to Minnesota in July  2016. Funds raised from this will be used as stated above: for insurance deductibles  genetic testing  fertility treatments  and to have funds available for unforeseen medical costs. These funds will be directly deposited into a joint bank account between Kali and Sean  where it will be accessed for Kali's medical bills.Thanks to all the people who have donated so far  it’s unbelievably generous  and a huge relief to not have to worry excessively over money during a time full of enough challenges. We are overwhelmed by the support  and grateful for all the ways you have shown support so far."

Everything changed almost overnight. She was forced to leave her job due to her health and new restrictions. Her condition was managed with chemo all winter and in May she underwent a bone marrow transplant at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. Since that time  mom has been putting one foot in front of the other on this journey that is recovery.Despite suddenly being out of work and the myriad costs associated with multiple trips back and forth to Boston  mom has managed to find a way to make ends meet. Much of this is due to help from friends and family. Mom has been hesitant to start a GoFundMe site because she felt strongly she did not want to ask for help or \"handouts\" as long as she could find creative ways to finance this journey on her own. Unfortunately  at this point  this is no longer a realistic option.A few weeks ago mom's leukemia cells reappeared  and last Monday she was readmitted to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston with fevers of unknown origin. She has been here since  undergoing numerous procedures  with no discharge date determined as of yet. Once the medical team makes a plan (which we have total faith they will do)  and discharge mom to go home  we know that this rollercoaster ride will continue and she will likely have even more frequent trips to Boston for check-ups and treatment.We understand that for many  there isn't much extra to go around and that folks have struggles of their own that they are facing. Our ask is that if you are in a position  our family would be incredibly grateful if you would consider donating to help defray some of mom’s costs. No amount is too small  and any and all donations would be greatly appreciated.All funds raised will be put towards; gas for the trips to Boston  special food and groceries for mom's diet  medical co-pays/bills  prescription costs  medical supplies for the home (not covered by insurance)  severely increased monthly health insurance premiums and other costs which directly result from mom's leukemia and treatment. In addition  as we approach winter in New England  it is highly likely that mom may occasionally need to find lodging near Boston if a snowstorm should prevent a return trip home after an appointment.It is difficult enough to face a life-threatening illness like AML  but is made all the more daunting when you're also exerting energy worrying about bills  logistics  and how to continue to finance your journey forward. Particularly when you don't know how long that journey may take.For those who want to read more about mom's journey please feel free to follow along on our Caring Bridge website:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/carolineclifton.Thank you to all who have reached out over the last few months  sent messages of support and love  sent gas or grocery gift cards  done errands  offered a ride  an ear  a shoulder. Mom would not have gotten this far without the support of incredible friends and family that we are so very fortunate and appreciative to have.One of the reasons we started this site is that so many of you amazing people have been asking \"what can I do to help?\" and  unfortunately  as a function of mom's condition  there just aren't many tangible options. She can't have flowers  she can't have food prepared by anyone outside the home and visitors are severely restricted. This is one way to help which would go directly towards alleviating unnecessary anxiety for mom  and for our family.  We understand that so many face struggles of their own  and would never want anyone to donate if it would negatively impact them or their family. That said  if you are in a position to  our family would be incredibly grateful if you'd please consider donating any amount you could comfortably spare - truly  no amount is too small! If you are unable to donate  words of encouragement  positive thoughts  and prayers are always enormously appreciated and gratefully received.Please feel free to share and thank you all in advance for considering donating.

"Medical","November 4, 2018","Saving Simon","$17,258","$30,000","248","5","247","1.2k","AUSTIN","TX","Simon’s Diagnosis and Prognosis: Our sweet  little miracle boy (chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer left mommy nearly infertile)  Simon Alexander Croke  was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Sanfilippo Syndrome (also known as MPS III) on October 17  2018 at 29 months of age. It is a progressive and fatal disease affecting 1 in 70 000 children. We are devastated and heartbroken... MPS III is commonly referred to as Alzheimer's for children. Unfortunately  Simon was born with a change in his DNA that causes a critical enzyme to be made improperly (or not at all). Because he doesn’t have enough of this enzyme  he cannot breakdown and recycle natural cellular waste. Thus  Simon’s cells become clogged with toxic levels of heparan sulfate. While every cell in his body is affected  his brain cells suffer the most. The effects  of which  have already become apparent: speech problems  developmental delays  and mild-moderate hearing loss.  There is currently no cure for Sanfilippo  but we remain hopeful that Simon will qualify and be selected for a clinical trial offering gene therapy  which has been showing some positive results. Without intervention  Simon and other children with MPS III will go on to experience progressive cognitive decline; lose the ability to speak  walk  and eat; and eventually die in their teenage years. This genetic disorder is relentless and devastating. At this time  only supportive or “palliative” care is available. Life expectancy is typically around 15 years  at best. For children living with Sanfilippo today  participation in a clinical trial is their only opportunity to try a treatment. Unfortunately  these trials only accept an extremely small number of patients  and time is not something these children have on their side. Medical research has recently yielded some promising results with real hopes for the future  but there is still much unknown and no therapies  to date  have been approved by the FDA for treatment. Call-to-Action: As one can imagine  despite having health insurance  the amount of financial resources  time  and energy spent on therapy  medical bills  and child care has already taken a toll  and we are just in the beginning stages of this battle to save our Simon. Please consider making a donation through GoFundMe to fund Simon’s medical bills and related expenses. If you prefer to make a tax-deductible donation  please choose this 501c3  non-profit Cure Sanfilippo Foundation (Tax ID: 46-4322131)  and make the gift in honor of \"Simon Croke\":  https://curesff.org/donate/ (or by check to - Cure Sanfilippo Foundation  PO Box 6901  Columbia  SC 29260). This organization advocates for and funds research directed toward a cure or treatment options for Simon and other children with Sanfilippo Syndrome. Time is of the essence! Please help us improve the quality of  and extend  our little boy’s life. Please share this GoFundMe page on your social media outlets or with friends and family. We are counting on compassionate people like you to embrace our story and hope  and take action by telling others about Sanfilippo Syndrome. Awareness leads to contributions. We appreciate each and every one of them. For more information about Sanfilippo Syndrome  please click on this link:  https://curesff.org/ More About Simon’s Journey: At first  we suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder before discovering this underlying diagnosis. We approached Simon’s pediatrician at 13 months of age because he wasn’t responding to his name or hitting his developmental milestones  and had developed repetitive play (i.e. spinning of toys). This lead to consulting with a pediatric neurologist who ordered a medley of tests. The results of all were thankfully normal  but left us without answers. In order to help Simon with his challenges  he began receiving physical  occupational  and speech therapies at 15 months of age. Alina (mommy) also ramped up teaching Simon how to use sign language since he was nonverbal at this point. After six months of intensive therapies  his pediatric developmental specialist assessed Simon as having only developed three months of skill. He had the skill level of a baby half of his age. This news destroyed us. We and the therapists had been working continuously to close Simon’s gaps in development. It's almost as if he was unable to progress any faster  but no healthcare professional  at that point  could provide a reason. Despite Simon’s delays and our feelings that something wasn’t quite right  we continued to focus on the positives: He was slowly making progress and achieving goals; Simon slept and ate well; and he affectionately connected with us through hugs  smiles  and laughter. As Simon’s medical therapies continued  we pursued additional help for Simon. At 21 months of age  he began seeing a movement therapist to help him with his gross motor skills  craniosacral therapist to help him with his ability to speak  and chiropractor to adjust a newly discovered head and neck bone jam. Simon began to move in ways that he wasn’t able to in infancy! It was beautiful to watch. We thought that we had possibly discovered the cause of his problems. But  we continued to pursue other possibilities as well.  At the recommendation of Simon’s pediatric developmental specialist  he underwent an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test at 25 months of age. This revealed that Simon had mild-moderate hearing loss. We were shocked and confused because he had passed his newborn hearing screen. Simon now wears hearing aids  and his language and expressive language skills have begun to blossom. We thought that we had possibly discovered a secondary cause of his problems. But  we had one last possibility to investigate. At 28 months  we consulted with a pediatric geneticist (after sitting on the appointment calendar for six months). She predicted that he had a metabolic storage disorder  and ordered a full body x-ray  abdominal ultrasound  and urine test. After two long weeks of waiting for the results  we were crushed by the news of Simon’s new Sanfilippo Syndrome diagnosis. The urine test revealed the presence of elevated concentrations of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)  which meant that Simon could not break them down. They had been accumulating in his body tissue  and he had been abnormally excreting them in his urine. These accumulated molecules have been causing Simon’s cellular machinery to work improperly. Once enough of the toxic GAGs build up  his brain cells die and vital brain tissue is lost leaving him with permanent brain damage."

Although Lynn has always been a beacon of light to her family  friends   and community she has recently had a stroke of bad health. Lynn has large blood clots in both her legs  which has been preventing blood flow to her feet. She is scheduled to have two separate surgeries to remove the blood clots  in an attempt to save her feet from being amputated. Due to her current condition she has been out of work for over two weeks  and it is not clear when she will be able to return. Unfourntly  Lynn does not have the luxury of being able to afford health insurance  so all of her medical bills will need to be paid in full. We are asking that people reach into their heart and give what they can to help Lynn pay for her medical bills and modifications to her home. Any amount will help and is greatly appreciated. Thank you and have a blessed day."

Patty  his partner of 37 years  managed to get him to the ER at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas.  There  the doctors assessed that Sammy's kidneys had shut down and began emergency dialysis. It has been a scary past week and a half  but Sammy is feeling a lot better now  and can't wait to get out of the hospital!For the next few weeks and possibly months  Sammy is going to need dialysis treatments three times a week to clean toxins from his blood until his kidneys start working better again. And he'll need to be monitored closely by a kidney doctor as well as his primary care physician and a cardiologist. All of this care is critical to Sammy's health and a big life change. It's also very expensive. Currently Sammy doesn't have health insurance and so that makes this challenging situation a lot scarier. Insurance hasn't been affordable for Sammy recently (more than $600 per month)  so he's been paying out of pocket for his doctor visits  lab work  and prescriptions. Now that he'll need dialysis three days a week  though  his medical care is going to be much more expensive. Plus there's a big hospital bill on the horizon. We're reaching out to some programs that offer financial assistance in hopes that there might be a grant available to help pay for dialysis. Sammy's not eligible for Medicaid right now  but may be able to apply for it in February. In the meantime  Sammy is in a gap where there's no insurance and not enough cash on hand to cover the costs. If you know Sammy  you know he is a great guy. He's caring and funny. He'd give you the shirt off his back. He's made his motorcycle shop into a warm center for the dirt bike community  adding movie screenings in his shop's parking lot. He takes care of everyone. He's the most loving brother a sister could ask for. He's never asked for help and doesn't want to ask for help. But he really needs some help right now and so we - his sister Maria and his partner Patty - are asking on his behalf. Friends and family have mentioned putting together a GoFundMe page so that they can chip in. We would be so grateful if you could help us out and donate if you can and spread the word. The funds will go to:- Paying the bill from Sammy's hospital stay - currently $21 000 and counting- Paying for Sammy's dialysis treatments until he has Medicaid - $1 500 per week- Paying for Sammy's doctor visits and lab work- Paying for Sammy's prescriptions We want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for reading this message and for any help you're able to send Sammy's way. He's given so much to us and we want to make sure he's taken care of. We love him to the moon and back. Love Maria (Sam's sister) & Patty (Sam's partner)"

I'm Laura Cohen  Alex's mom  and I've started this fundraiser for Alex with the help of his fiancee  Evie Sirianni  his father  Marty Cohen  and his stepmother  Janet Krews. We are the ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER TEAM! I live in Gainesville  where Alex is undergoing treatment at Shands Cancer Center  and am one of Alex's caretakers as he goes through this health crisis. The physical and emotional costs of a cancer diagnosis are well known  but the financial burden is equally tough. Even with health insurance  the costs associated with the intensive treatment Alex requires to beat cancer are astronomical  especially since he has been mostly unable to work. All donations will go directly to unpaid medical bills  as well as living expenses while Alex is out of work. We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support as we help Alex on his way to a cancer-free life!THE BAD: Alex \"Coach\" Cohen was diagnosed in February with testicular cancer that has spread to his lungs and abdomen and is facing the fight of his life. Alex underwent surgery to remove his left testicle in February and was hospitalized a few weeks later to have another procedure to insert a nephrostomy tube in his left kidney  which was not functioning due to the presence of a massive tumor in his abdomen.  Last week Alex began an aggressive 12-week chemotherapy treatment  to be followed by an RPLND surgery sometime in July to remove any tumors left in his abdomen and lymph nodes. As a result of these treatments  Alex has been unable to work and will soon use up his allotted sick time.Meanwhile Alex and his fiancee  Evie  had been saving to pay for their wedding next year  and for a down payment on their first house. While he does have health insurance through his job as a high school teacher and football coach  there are numerous medical and living expenses not covered during this time. To help care for Alex while he undergoes the finest treatment available at Shands Cancer Center  Evie had to quit her job and move to Gainesville. Consequently  their savings has practically vanished.THE GOOD:As a high school teacher and football coach for the past nine years  Alex has relished the opportunity to assist dozens of students and players overcome major obstacles in their lives. And now he faces this personal battle and he NEEDS YOUR HELP.You can participate in helping Coach Cohen overcome the biggest challenge of his life – the villain cancer. The ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER Team is actively raising money to help offset his medical bills and living expenses during the rigorous four-month chemotherapy regimen and potential surgery this summer. And unfortunately cancer simply doesn’t go away – Alex will need to be monitored closely for at least the next five years for the possibility of a recurrence and more costly medical expenses.  So please help us in any way you can as The ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER Team continues to work endlessly for Alex and his future wife Evie. We Believe That We Will Win!"

Sophia was seven at the time. We were at the dinner table when he collapsed. I thought that nothing could be more difficult than grieving his loss and instantly becoming the sole breadwinner for us. Sophia and I eventually healed and have managed to keep a delicate balance financially  through the recession  until this year and my diagnosis.When I told Sophia that I found a lump in my breast  I took her hand and helped her to feel it.  She cried. One of her first thoughts was about what would happen to her if we had a bad outcome (at that time we didn’t know the diagnosis.)   She said  ‘Does this mean I’ll become an orphan?’   Which in thinking about it was a totally understandable response from a teenager who has already lost her father.   I especially don’t want the impact of my cancer to derail her grades since she heads to college in only two years.   YIKES! She’s a good student and a great daughter.   I’m doing the best that I can for her.   I feel like I’m treading hard to keep our heads above water and under normal circumstances  I’m very self-sufficient  but with this diagnosis I need help. I’ve been self-employed for many years and am also a temporary-part time employee for a local community college.   Sophia and I don’t have benefits like health insurance and traditional sick  vacation and other supportive resources.   We have high deductibles  high out of pocket limits and a 20% copay for everything.   We were already operating on a very thin financial margin when I was diagnosed.   So  this health setback has been financially devastating  and the bills continue to amass frighteningly.  Preparing this message to share with others has been a challenge because it’s hard for me to ask for help.   My friends have had to remind me that it’s not JUST about me  it’s about my daughter too.   So  I’m asking for support from friends  family and strangers. I wish things were different but wishing hasn’t made the challenges go away.   Normally  I would just do more to resolve the financial situation  but with ‘health’ at some point the notion of taking on more becomes self-limiting. I’ve managed to remove the ‘killer breast’ and face a year of chemo/drug therapy to assure that I have a strong chance of survival.   I hope you might find it in your heart to help me. I promise I’ll continue to be who I am…. a giver  a person who serves and to be the best MOM I can be.   Please keep us in your prayers and know that I am eternally grateful for any amount you can donate to help us out.  God bless you."

As a result  it was advised that Kyoung-Ah begin further treatments. To date she has received five infusions. A recent scan shows the condition is worsening (perhaps temporarily) and we do not know how long the treatment will need to continue   but we’re hoping the treatment is working.Many of you have asked how you can help   so we have created this site as a way to help us all contribute to her healing journey and encircle her with our collective support.As you might suspect. the practical and financial concerns that accompany a serious illness are many. Kyoung-Ah’s health insurance requires numerous copays and is finicky about the treatment options it will pay for. A lot of oncology related treatment (e.g. acupuncture  water/land physical therapy  pain management  etc.) which aid in managing the pain and side effects of chemo and radiation  are not covered. In addition her medical leave at work is quickly evaporating  and her treatment plan will extend far beyond the time that this ends.A further practical concern is managing day to day living tasks.  Kyoung-Ah's mother   who is currently visiting from Korea  is not able to stay for the whole duration of  treatment. Routine tasks such as housecleaning and grocery shopping are not possible now given Kyoung-Ah’s compromised immune system. A way we can help is to fund a care assistant  cleaning services  and transportation to appointments.  Also since doctors have advised a strictly organic diet  funds can go toward purchases at places like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.Emotional support is also important and people have asked about gifts such as flowers  plants or candles.  These are such thoughtful ideas but we want to pass along a recommendation from the American Cancer Society that these type of items are not a good fit for patients with weakened immune systems. Gifts that are encouraged include organic unscented products  such as  lip balms  shea butter  coconut oil and lavender products which help with insomnia.  Also suggested are things that can make her laugh. Laughter is one of life's simple and powerful gifts proven to encourage healing.Our goal for this funding site is to make it easy for all of us to help and for our dear friend to get what she needs when she needs it.  We want her to be able to focus her energy on her health and not on the details of managing her illness.We thank you for being a part of her healing community and hope this opens up a direct way for you to take action to support our friend.  Within the bounds of our respect for her privacy  we will keep you posted on her journey and on any changing needs.With much love  respect and gratitude!"

Thankfully  after four days in the ICU  she's out of immediate danger  but her recovery is expected to be quite long. Returning to work will be even longer. I wish you could know Connor and Adrienne like I know them. Connor and Adrienne are everywhere in our community. Connor does well in school and sports  has been working at the Queen Anne Community Center and other part time jobs for years  yet somehow will always make time to help with someone's garden or to build a deck. He makes friendships with people of all ages and once you are his friend he will always be there for you  always checking in on you. His fabulous mom Adrienne has a million dollar smile and her home and heart are always open to all of Connor's friends and teammates. She's been raising Connor singlehanded for ten years  as Connor's father is not present in their lives. They have always taken care of others and they have always taken care of each other. But now they are facing a crisis where our community needs to help take care of them. They have limited health insurance and know that many of their expenses will not be covered. They expect their share of the first medical portion alone to exceed $10 000. We would like to set a goal of $10 000 to cover their living expenses and out of pocket medical expenses for the next couple of months. All proceeds will go to their necessities and medical expenses. This is a parent's worst nightmare  to be unable to work and support her child. All Adrienne should be focusing on right now is her recovery. All Connor should be doing now is studying for his finals  working his part-time jobs  being with his friends  and looking forward to Christmas. Instead  he's spent the last four days in the hospital helping his mom and worrying about how they'll pay for utilities  food  and whether they can even afford this month's rent.100% of your donation will go to keeping them afloat until everything returns to normal. Whether your donation is big or small  it will truly mean the world to them. We will update the gofundme site with further information about Adrienne's health as it becomes available.

It was a break-out year for her in so many ways  and now she could really benefit from our help as her huge momentum has been interrupted. On Christmas Eve  Kaitlyn was leaving Driggs  Idaho in her truck and collided with an oncoming vehicle on icy roads. She was incredibly lucky to survive the impact  but it left her seriously injured. That night  she had surgery to repair a torn bladder  and a few days later  another team of surgeons stabilized four fractures in her pelvis and one in her sacrum. She also has a broken fibula. The surgeries went well; she now has several external rods holding her pelvis together as it heals  but she won't be able to put weight on her legs for ten weeks as the bones heal. Her spirit has remained amazingly positive  her big smile still spreads across her face frequently  and now she's putting the same level of focus into her recovery that has helped her become such a dominant force on the bike. Kaitlyn already has begun extensive physical therapy  and that will continue for the next few months as she works to maintain and then regain strength and mobility. She'll then re-learn how to walk and eventually pedal a bike. It's going to be a slow process  but she's already surprising her care team - she managed to get out of her bed and into a chair just one day after her last surgery!She's also now dealing with the realities of the next few months  and this is where we all can potentially help out through the Kaitlyn Boyle Recovery Fund. She was slated to be working in the field for NOLS and Prescott College for the next two months  but she's now forced to forgo that income. Her health insurance will help substantially until she leaves the hospital  but then she's faced with the expenses of medical equipment  accommodations for 2+ months of recovery  extensive physical therapy and home health care  replacing her totaled truck and then slowly easing back into a more regular lifestyle and training. For Kaitlyn  2019 was to be a year of transitioning toward training and racing as a professional mountain bike athlete. Instead  her racing goals are temporarily pushed to the back burner  and she's beginning 2019 setting goals around accomplishments like being able to get out of bed and into a wheelchair without assistance. If you're able to contribute even a few dollars to help support Kaitlyn through this recovery process and get her back on track toward recovering fully and completely regaining her strength and fitness  she will be filled with so  so much gratitude. All the love and healing vibes she has already received from everyone has helped motivate and inspire her to remain positive and focused on recovering! Recognizing that not everyone has the means to contribute financially  messages of encouragement  cards  inspiring decorations  and anything else that can be sent through the mail will reach her at the address below.

Ultimately  it was found that his hemoglobin was a 6 and normal is between 12 and 16  he had a hole in his stomach that was quaterized  and 6 ulcers. The MRI showed he needed surgery on his back due to a fracture caused by other issues. After another blood transfusion  he had his surgery on November 26  2018  which included a laminectomy  a bilateral hemi laminatomy  a medial facetectomy  and a foraminotomy   . For those of you who do not know Michael let me tell you a bit about him. He had a hard life growing up but that didn’t change him for the worse. Michael is hardworking  loving  and selfless. He goes beyond for those he loves and for those he does not even know. More times than I can count  he has been there and neglected his own happiness and well-being to make sure someone else is taken care of. Michael works 2 jobs and is up every morning at 2 am and doesn’t get home most nights until 7 pm. He has done more than I could ever ask for our family and has never complained once. He stepped up and has taken care of my daughter Mackenzie. He raised her as his own for almost 20 years doing all the things a good father would do after her biological father decided not to be in the picture. Back in 2014  when Colton was born  James (Colton’s dad) who was 15 at the time  was left homeless. His mother passed away when he was 14 and shortly after his father had to be put in a nursing home. Michael did not hesitate and he took custody of James and has stepped up and did all the things a parent would do for him including helping him graduate  making sure he had health ins  and so much more. He has taken care of all 3 kids as if they are his own and never complained or asked for anything in return. This is also a man who helps others we don’t even know. He donates toys for the poor at Christmas  helps me collect things year round for the homeless  donates his time and abilities to those who cannot afford to pay someone (including fixing cars for free)  and has even opened up  our home to homeless individuals (more than once) and helped them get back on their feet. Prior to this we were collecting things for a homeless community and even in all this mess he is asking me to make sure I finish what we started.Michael will need continued care including another endoscopy in about 5 weeks. Unfortunately  Michael has no health insurance due to not being able to afford it at this time and is not eligible for Medicaid or state insurance. We will be applying for charity care but that may not be approved and will certainly not cover all the expenses we have and will incur. He will be out of work for several weeks and is the main source of income for our home. Our savings are depleted as we bought our home last year in August and then had the issue 8 months later in March that destroyed our kitchen  which the insurance did not completely cover.So now he needs help and I am asking all of you to please donate what you can. If you cannot donate  please help anyway you can by sharing this and continuing to pray for him and his recovery. Thank you all for taking the time to help. May God continue to bless all of you and your families."

What was supposed to be a brief and fast visit  quickly became an overnight stay for a CT Scan  blood work  urine samples  fluid drain and 2 ultrasounds. By 11 AM  she was informed a semi-solid mass  measuring 6.8cm was found on her left ovary and a cluster of enlarged lymph-nodes around her kidney.She was referred to a GYN Oncologist and on 1/30/19 she received the diagnosis of Serous Ovarian Cancer  Stage 3 at age 29.On 2/7/19 She was scheduled for surgery for a portocath placement so she was able to receive chemotherapy every 21 days.On 2/13/19 Cecily had her first round of chemo at Kaiser Permanente. Her treatment plan is for a combined 6 rounds of chemotherapy  plus a full hysterectomy midway; which is a 4-6 week recovery  tentatively scheduled for the end of April/beginning of May.Meanwhile  Cecily was tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene (Breast Cancer Gene) and a mutation was found in one of her BRCA1 genes  which puts her at an increased risk of breast cancer  as well as ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Cecily  unfortunately  has no health insurance as she was working multiple jobs to support herself and her family. With this diagnosis  Cecily has had to cut her work hours down to 20 hours a month (based on health and well being) and is now relying on family members for financial support  as she has now emptied what savings she did have.After treatment is completed  Cecily will still have frequent CT Scans  lab work to monitor a potential re-occurrence as well as mammograms and breast cancer screenings as she is now considered to be at high-risk for breast cancer.All funds raised will go towards medications  office visits  her monthly bills and living expenses. Our Cecily is still her positive self and remains extremely hopeful with her ridiculous sense of humor through this entire process. Any and all help is appreciated in every aspect."

We will keep this page updated as time progresses.Elizabeth is 21 years old and just starting her life and career in animal care.  She is employed at ACE Pet Resort in Sarasota FL as an assistant manager and she describes her experiences there akin to going to summer camp every day.  It's not an easy job because it takes passion  a strong work ethic and unconditional love for animals.  She has all of this and more.  Recently she took in a foster dog from Vintage Paws  Kenny  who had advanced lung cancer.  She gave Kenny the best remaining 8 months possible with her love and incredible care.Elizabeth has been blessed with many passions in life. She has a very diversified love of music and plays the guitar and sings.  When she was 14 she fell in love with a rescued Thoroughbred horse that was being nurtured back to health. Cayenne has been with Elizabeth ever since and this love of animals has become the cornerstone in which we have built all of our lives.  Regardless of being at stage 2 or 4  the treatment will require chemotherapy.  The types of chemo that will be used during treatment will have a devastating impact on her physically and will have long term effects on her future. She will be seeing specialists throughout this process and will undergo therapies to mitigate some of these long term effects - most of which are outside of her health insurance plan.  Although we don't have an exact cost estimate  we are to understand these particular costs could exceed $15 000 - none of which are covered by her insurance.Total financial impact.  Chemo and radiation  and most all other standard tests and procedures should be covered by insurance  however the co-pays  travel and her inability to work during this time will have a serious impact on her and her family.  At this point  we don't have an exact amount but we are estimating a total financial impact that could exceed $25 000.The positive news is that there is a cure for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cure involves chemotherapy and radiation to start.  She is in the early stages of the planning and getting ready for treatment.  She will receive at least two chemo treatments in this process  and if the cancer is at stage 4  the chemo treatments will extend to 4 to 6 months.  Please help if you can. Elizabeth has been incredibly strong thus far however if you or anyone you know has been impacted by cancer you know how devastating this will be in so many ways.  Her family and friends are positive she will beat this and will continue being an inspiration and blessing to all animals.  If you are unable to donate  please share this gofundme account  leave a message of your support  say a prayer and keep us in your thoughts as she battles through this.With love and appreciation  Nancy and Matt Smallwood."

I have worked as a Travel Nurse all over the country and spent the last few years at the Presbyterian Hospital located in Espanola  NM after making Santa Fe  NM my permanent residence about 4 years ago.  This magical place  Santa Fe with a community like no other which has embraced  supported and encouraged me in ways I am overwhelmed and eternally grateful for.    On October 18th  2018 a bronchoscopy confirmed a non operable Lung Cancer due to high up lymph node involvement.  A few days later  the most  unfortunate news came from an MRI of the brain which showed multiple  scattered cancerous lesions which had migrated from the lung to my entire brain.    Because of the brain involvement  my cancer was diagnosed at Stage IV.   I am not a candidate for radiation therapy at this time  as it would be whole brain radiation because it is so widely spread throughout my brain and whole brain radiation would be both debilitating as well as  leave me with a very poor quality of life and function.  There was actually a little good news in all of these unexpected findings.  The pathology reports of the lung biopsies showed a unique gene mutation which has been responsive  to a newer targeted  therapy called Tagresso.  This treatment  is a little easier on a person than standard chemo infusions  and initially allows for a better quality of life.  The bad news...this treatment only works for so long and will never \"eradicate\" the cancer.  The goal is to control any progression until the cancer outsmarts the drug and mutates again making this treatment no longer valid.  The current studies In The New England Journal of Medicine show this drug as giving a person anywhere from 1 year to 2.5 years with no cancer progression.  Without this treatment  I am told I had 1-2 months to live.   I began taking Tagresso on November 1  21018. Many people have had legitimate questions and I would like to answer them as well as let you know the involved costs  concerns and obstacles I am facing. The Tagresso Medication costs an average of $14 000 - $15 000 per month and at this time has been  covered by my health insurance for the first few months.  At some point  however   insurance WILL  stop paying and when this happens   I will apply for assistance from the pharmaceutical company to hopefully help off set the extraordinary cost of treatment.    Because of my brain involvement   and the possibility of brain swelling and/or seizures and the impairment of my coordination   I am unable to operate a motor vehicle and also unable to perform my duties as an RN.   Although I do have health insurance    I have a high deductible plan which required a $5 000 deductible which was quickly met in October at the time of my initial  testing  workup and diagnosis.  As of January 1  2018  I will then have to meet a $5000 deductible AGAIN  in order to keep my providers and care consistent.My biggest hope and goal is to get to MD Anderson in Houston for a 2nd opinion as these folks are the best!  Only being given one option of treatment for such a limited time leaves me determined to get to the experts for their knowledge and opinion as I am determined to beat this!  So  in the mean time  you will find me embracing and enjoying every God given day and moment to the best of my ability.  You will find me writing music  writing a book  recording an album  spending time with friends  family  my dog  and best friend Maggie  and my love Mathiew.   You will also find me working within the community on volunteer projects in order to give back and pay it forward and feel connected to my community.  You will find me working for trade such as helping my friend out at her salon in exchange for hair care services and products.  You will find me focusing on rest  healing  nutrition and the power of positive everything.  Now that you have the whole story  perhaps it helps you to better understand my situation  prognosis and financial concerns.  The cost of getting to MD Anderson for a second opinion varies and is expected to be anywhere from $5000 to $10 000.  I will update this information as soon as I hear from them regarding the specific costs.   So  this is what I am asking for your help with   and although I am currently blessed enough to have this fairly normal quality of life at this time  there are many things going on behind the scenes I choose not to bring to the table when in public.  Things like the  skin changes  and painful neuropathies  that make it incredibly uncomfortable for my skin to touch anything from clothes  to bed sheets  mouth sores that make eating and drinking painful and challenging  rashes to my face and skin  stomach issues we wont get into here   tender fingers making it painful to play guitar or wash dishes and depression and disconnected feelings from the multiple medications I am on.   But  none of this will  stop me from seeing my friends when my weekly Platelet and Neutrophil Counts are good.  And this will NOT stop me from playing and writing music and participating in live performances and  singing my heart out at every opportunity.  This will NOT stop me from laughing with each and every one of you as much as possible.  And this will NOT stop me having hope and believing in miracles.  This will NOT STOP ME FROM LIVING LIFE TO IT's FULLEST POTENTIAL!I have already been hospitalized once so far for several days due to brain swelling which caused slurred speech and tongue deviation.  I am now on daily meds to prevent siezures and to attempt to control brain swelling.  I hope this has helped to answer your questions and to have a better understanding of my situation.    As a Native American friend once shared with me  it is important to get up every day and give thanks to your God of choice or to recognize your spirituality or to acknowledge and embrace the Sun.  Whatever it is that inspires you!   To count our many blessings and to say out loud  \"Today is a good day to live  and Today is a good day to die. ...I choose to Live today!\"  And I couldnt agree more! Here's to life!!!  Please feel free to pass this along and share!  Thank you  from my heart  to yours."

He assumed the weird dizziness he was feeling was a response to the ongoing stress caused by turmoil surrounding Alison’s job. That morning  she was let go from her position as a museum educator after nearly 14 years of building creative and dynamic programming that served the Akron community.By that evening  Chris was feeling worse. He was extremely dizzy and couldn’t get up off the floor or stop vomiting. He was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. After a long night of monitoring  doctors concluded that Chris had suffered a large cerebellar stroke. But that was only the beginning. A day later  Chris’s brain began swelling and he required emergency surgery to relieve the pressure. The procedure saved his life  but in the ensuing days  Chris developed pneumonia and acute kidney injuries. For five days  he remained intubated as a partially collapsed lung kept him from breathing on his own.Chris fought for his life and won. Now the hard work of recovering from the stroke begins. This week Chris will head to Edwin Shaw Rehabilitation Hospital  where he will work to regain walking  balance and other basic skills. Because of the job loss  Alison will need to make large monthly COBRA payments to her former employer to keep health insurance.

For the past 22 years  he has been living with a heart condition called Dilated Cardiomyopathy. This was due to a virus  the common cold  attacking his heart muscle damaging it beyond repair. In 1997  at 27 years old  he had to stop working and became \"Mr. Mom\" to our two girls and our son that was on the way. In 2005  he had a defibrillator implanted and subsequently has had three separate occasions in which it shocked him to save his life. In March of 2018  he was hospitalized for a week due to his heart weakening. His medication was increased and a few changes made. At the end of June  he returned and was admitted to CVICU. After a heart catheter procedure  my daughter Ashley and I were brought into the consultation room and given the news Ron was in need of a heart transplant. We were in total shock and it wasn’t until the next day the doctors broke the news to Ron. Devastation and disbelief are the only two words to describe what he was feeling.Once they got his heart pressures under control  he was given the option of an internal heart pump  LVAD  left ventricular arterial device or go home with an IV pumping medication to his heart to stay alive. The upside to the LVAD was he would be moved to the transplant priority list and for one thirty day period he would be moved up a tier on the list.With a lot of convincing  he decided to get the LVAD surgery. On July 10th  the device was implanted. He was put on temporary dialysis and received several blood transfusions and left the hospital 3 weeks after surgery.  Ron has gone to weekly LVAD clinics and cardiac rehab appointments 3x’s a week. He has had a very hard time adjusting to living on batteries and having to plug in to an outlet at night. The dressing changes for the cord coming out of his stomach have gotten more tolerable as they went from once a day to every 3 days. His appointments are now spread out to only once a month with a quick weekly blood draw. Ron is an amazing husband  father  and grandfather to our 3 children; Ashley (26)  Alexis (24)  Austin (21)  and Brantley (6) who adores his papa. Ron has been a father figure to neighborhood kids  classroom parent  neighborhood watch  and a softball coach for the past 20 years. Everyone who meets Ron loves him and everywhere we go somebody knows him. We joke and call him the mayor of Summerville. He means so much to those who know him. After explaining all of this  Ron and I were told before the LVAD surgery  we needed to start fundraising for his heart transplant. We have private health insurance  but our out of pocket costs along with the medications needed will be astronomical and I will have to take leave from work to be his caregiver. The great news is MUSC has moved him up one tier on the transplant list for the next 30 days!My family and I will do whatever it takes to help Ron. If you can spare any amount  my family would be more grateful than I can possibly ever tell you. Please share his story and keep my wonderful husband in your thoughts and prayers."

Most cancer patients spend more for out of pocket medical expenses than was anticipated.  Sean was lucky that he was able to continue working while undergoing chemotherapy last fall.  Unfortunately  he hasn't been able to return to work due to complications from his treatment.  His future treatment plan is not yet finalized but will include more chemotherapy  radiation and surgeries.   We have set up this page to help Sean and Vickey with the cost of current and future expenses. While being treated Sean worked with the American Cancer Society to effect change in Maine state law to require health insurance to cover cancer screening for younger patients.  He was hoping to testify at a public hearing on this bill but was back in the hospital and had his statement read before the legislators instead.  Below Sean will give you his story in his own words:I am Sean Riley of Falmouth  ME husband and father of a daughter and son. I am currently recuperating from my 2nd of several anticipated cancer surgeries.  I still recall the sinking look on my wife Vickey's face when we were told that I had cancer. In my heart I knew something was not right but when those words are spoken it officially becomes your family's most life changing moment.  I am an otherwise healthy individual and never expected to be battling cancer in my mid 40's. I am 6 ft 178 lbs and see my doctor annually and have little to complain about medically. My cancer story starts back in spring of 2018 when I noticed some small rectal bleeding and blood in my stools. While alarming  I initially didn't think it was significant enough to rush to the emergency room. I wondered if I ate something bad  had a virus or was this really blood at all? My older sister had several large polyps removed in the summer of 2017 and her doctor recommended all her siblings be proactive and be screened too. I waited a week and then discussed it with my wife and told her I was reaching out to my Primary Care Doctor and requesting a colorectal cancer screening asap. Unfortunately it took several weeks to get into my primary care and then 5 months to have a colonoscopy. This waiting time was not easy  symptoms did not stop and I continued on with life hoping for the best results during my scope in the fall.  Unfortunately my results revealed stage 2 colorectal cancer that spread to my liver. I was quickly entered into a treatment plan. Thankfully after reviewing my colonoscopy results and some additional testing my medical team concluded my cancer was treatable  operable and survivable. It would be a long fall  winter and spring with 2 rounds of chemotherapy  radiation and several cancer surgeries. I continued working and driving the kids to and from school daily (400 miles a week). Chemotherapy was Oct through Christmas and then a week of amped up Radiation treatment ended in January of 2019.   I had my first surgery Feb 12th which was successful in removing the tumor from my colon. I returned home and to work 12 days later. Unfortunately after recovering from my surgery I developed a nasty infection. My return to work lasted 1 day as severe lower back pain sent me back to the operating table. A procedure to place a pelvic drain in my right buttock (haha) was used along with antibiotics to reduce the infection. This was a torturous 3 plus weeks. The infection pain was relentless even with painkillers and the drain location was just as painful as I was unable to sit or even lie on my back for more than a few minutes. Worse  the sutures that would allow me to reverse my iliostomy were leaking  causing fluid to create a pocket right below my tailbone. This meant delays in healing and moving forward to treat the liver cancer and reattaching my digestive system to normal functions. Unfortunately tissue is often damaged and weak from radiation making surgical recovery complicated. I was readmitted to the hospital for a week of IV medication and pain management.  In late March the decision was made to operate again after CT scan revealed my sutures were not sealing. The procedure was to clean the infection  move the pelvic drain to the front abdomen where it is less painful  check colon sutures and transplant healthy abdominal tissue into the infected pocket to promote blood flow and healing.I am now home again. I am not on pain killers anymore yeah... I am recovering and gaining strength slowly after dropping 20 lbs post surgeries and 30 lbs overall. I now resemble the skinny kid you remember (with gray hair...) I hope to return to work soon. Missing work has been tough both financially and personally. I can count on 1 hand the number of days I had missed work in 29 years. Vickey and the kids have been strong but it has been tough on everyone including family far and near. I am not a social media person I would much rather be in the company of the ones I care about than send a text  post or tweet (remember the Dominican...) Unfortunately that isn't always possible as we live such hectic lives. I was asked if I would be interested in a go fund page and I was initially hesitant. After hearing family members tell me about relatives and friends reaching out and their desire to help this made our decision easier. I am not private about my fight against cancer in fact I hope my story will help another family or individual choose to get screened. As I told the American Cancer Society and wrote in my statement to the State Legislature  if I can help one person not have too suffer the way I have then I will do whatever I can. Funds will go to paying my medical expenses including the copays  coinsurance and patient portions of bills that do and will continue to pile up. I was meticulous about not letting one bill get overlooked as our family is getting ready to close on our new home in Brunswick Maine. While I was recovering I worked with the American Cancer Society in Maine to help pass legislation (LD555) to lower cancer screening ages requiring medical insurance to pay for earlier tests for at risk patients to age 45 instead of 50. This adheres to the new medical guidelines. If you are 45 ask your doctor about being screened for colorectal cancer as it is the 2nd highest cancer killer in the country. If I was screened at 50 my situation would have not been as optimistic. Enough preaching....

It can wreak havoc on one's finances and the ability to just keep paying the bills in order to live.  Anyone facing the daunting task of healing and getting well shouldn't have to worry about going bankrupt or losing everything.  It's very clear that Jenny will be unable to work and while she has health insurance  it will not cover the cost of all her care. It's time now for us to send all the care and support we can spare to see her through the enormous challenges that lie ahead.  Anything  even the smallest amount  that you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Everything we can do to envelope her with healing thoughts and love is incredibly important so that her energy can be focused on beating this thing.  I will be posting regular updates and if you feel so inclined  please spread the word.  I thank you and I know Jenny thanks you from the bottom of her heart."

Triple-negative cancer is hard to treat; it has a high recurrence rate and the first round of treatment is the most critical to survival. Laurie is currently in the middle of a 16-week course of chemotherapy  which will be followed by surgery and probably radiation therapy. Active treatment is expected to go through April  or possibly longer depending on how well it works  and full recovery from surgery may take longer than that.   In the meantime  Laurie is unable to work during treatment and  as a longtime freelance writer & editor  is not eligible for any EDD/state or local disability benefits. Her emergency savings is dwindling fast  so we  The Love Team  are raising funds to help her and her 7-year-old daughter  so Laurie can fully focus on healing.

Before that  due to the cytogenetic features of her leukemia cells  she was moved from the Standard Risk treatment protocol to Very High Risk treatment protocol  a regimen that is more intensive and requires four additional week-long hospital stays for inpatient chemo administration.

We had hoped with all our hearts that this horrific and unexpected event would not repeat itself.Anahi was rushed to the hospital where an emergency cerebral catheterization and craniotomy were performed.

It was a very rainy morning  and he was heading to work to help a client get ready to leave the country. Jay’s brakes went out on his car. In a desperate moment  taking quick action to avoid hitting or hurting anyone else  he used his emergency brake and swerved into a tree.  The accident was bad and Jay is badly injured.  What we know so far is that he’s in the Trauma ICU unit with multiple injuries  including a broken back and is unable to lift his arms.  Jay is a hairdresser  lives alone in Dallas  TX and does not have health insurance.Current Situation:On Monday  February 11th  2019.  Friends were able to briefly visit Jay in the ICU.  At the time he couldn’t move his legs and only slightly move his hands.  To our knowledge his family lives in Arkansas.  He was receiving a breathing treatment when we managed to see him.We apologize for the limited information.  We are not family and due to HIPAA the hospital will only give us very limited information.   The true extent of his injuries is still unknown. We have no idea how long he will be in the hospital or how long his rehabilitation will take.  We will make updates to the campaign as soon as we have more news from the hospital doctors. Jay is very worried about how he will pay for the hospital  doctors  his rent and just survive without an income.  He feels terribly alone and has no one to help him but his friends.  Not having insurance  the hospital will soon start pressuring him to make payments which he is unable to afford. We would greatly appreciate it if you can help in any way. He’s in God's hands. Please pray for him. About Jay (James Long):Jay is seen by everyone that knows him as completely unselfish.  Every time you are around Jay  he is completely focused on you and never himself.  He has always been a ray of sunshine for anyone that came into contact with him.  He remembers everything you’ve ever told him about yourself or your family and is always quick to recall and ask about you and your family.  We need to give some of that back to him -- the care and love he deserves and needs.How will the fund be used?:The funds will be used to pay for Jay’s outstanding medical bills and living expenses.  The hospital bill he is facing will no doubt be astronomical. Our Message to you:  We would like to thank each and every one of you for any and all prayers  shares  or donations to help Jay through this incredibly difficult time. We’d like to have all of you who are able  to please visit Jay.  He will appreciate all the love and support anyone can give.  Every call and message will help him and give him a little more hope and strength to push on and fight for a full recovery."

I didn't see it as my role. But my love for Lucia and the Cordúa family is great and their immense local value to Houston is without question. Like countless Houstonians (and many beyond our city)  I love these good people and want to help.Lucia  her chef husband Michael Cordúa  and their chef son David Cordúa (& Michael's business partner) were some of the very first people to make me feel like Houston was my home and that I belonged here. Their embracing hospitality was genuine  but it's far from unique to me. They have been doing that in Houston for more than 30 years  deflecting and humbly acknowledging accolades  while continuing to serve  give back to  and help enhance our city. While Michael and David generally get the spotlight  people who know the family understand that it's Lucia's fire  kindness  warm heart  and open mind that are at the core of their family's values  organizations  and actions. About LuciaIn addition to her role as mother of 4 and grandmother to 5  Lucia is a licensed Acupuncturist and Oriental Medicine Diplomate. She currently cares for and treats many patients around Houston and in College Station. She specializes in all varieties of physical pain  menopause discomforts  and facial acupuncture. She takes an active role in providing care and assistance for her clients. In her acupuncture practice  she believes balancing helps everyone attain happiness and health. She's also a great deal of fun to be around. She always has a keen observation  a caring ear  and a flair for hospitality.  Lucia's Diagnosis & TreatmentTrue to form (and surprising no one who knows her)  Lucia has responded to the diagnosis and current treatment with strength  grace and a determined  positive outlook. Treatments naturally take their toll  but Lucia's spirits and focus are in the right place and her doctors are optimistic about the anticipated results.However  her doctors at MD Anderson have recommended an aggressive chemotherapy treatment to begin in January  which will last for six months. During this period  her ability to tend to her own patients will be significantly diminished as she rests and gives her body a chance to regain its health. Houston & The Cordúa FamilyLucia and her husband Michael opened Houston's first Central American restaurant in 1988  and in their 30+ years continuously contributed to and supported the Greater Houston community and its nonprofit organizations. As their son David grew up and became a local chef himself  he also became a important supporter of Houston in his own right. The family has been an active supporter of St. Thomas University  The Houston Zoo  Houston Food Bank  Strake Jesuit  Casa de Esperanza  American Leadership Forum  Casa Juan Diego  Save our ER  Children at Risk-Houston  Community Foundation  Duschene Academy  and more. The Cordúas have served on boards  helped to raise money  given their time  and prompted others to contribute as well.The Financial NeedWhile supported by health insurance  the affiliated medical bills and associated costs remain daunting and continue to add up. Every dollar raised  minus GoFundMe's small transaction fee  will go directly to helping cover Lucia's medical bills  lost income from recovery  and related expenses. I initially set this fundraising goal at $5 000  based on GoFundMe's best practices recommendations  but we're all pleased to see that the amount raised has far surpassed it. Every dollar is needed. Consistent with GoFundMe's recommendations  I have continued to raise the goal as the donations grow. This is my decision to help my friends and is not coming from them. Like anyone facing cancer treatment  their actual need is significantly and substantially higher and is not going away.Anything you are able to commit is sincerely and humbly appreciated. Both the Cordúa family and myself will reach out directly to thank you for your generosity and support. None of us expect it and all of us are ridiculously grateful for what has been shared to date. Your SupportI'm asking you to help support this family  one of Houston's key culinary legacies and community supporters  in whatever way you're able as they battle and face off against Cancer and the high costs of medical care.Anything you have to offer Lucia—including love  kind words  and encouragement—is humbly appreciated by my dear friends in the Cordúa family and by myself on their behalf. Thank you for taking the time  consideration  and energy to consider this request. With much gratitude and respect  Chip Rankin365Houston.comPhoto credit: Phaedra Cook  founder of Houston Food Finder .

I am very much in need of reliable transportation and we do not have the funds to purchase a new vehicle. Therefore  the funds we need will secure the purchase of a used car and cover the cost of medical bills not covered by our health insurance. Specifically  in regard to our $20 000 goal  we want to allocate $13 000 dollars towards a dependable car and $7 000 towards medical bills. Our children and I are working as a team. They want us to get through the next seven weeks as stress free as possible  since this time period is already going to be so very difficult for us. A reliable car will lessen our stress greatly. Not just during the next two months  but afterwards  since Chris will continue to have follow-up doctor appointments and testing  for at least five years. Another reason for a dependable vehicle  is to secure transportation for the children in my care. Although we do not have a specific deadline in mind  there is a sense of urgency since treatment as already started and ends in mid-March. We want to extend our deepest gratitude for any donation you feel comfortable giving to our cause. We will also greatly appreciate it if you share our GoFundMe link to your Facebook Timeline."

"Medical","November 9, 2018","Josh&apos;s Journey To Health","$15,777","$30,000","130","5","139","808","BUFORD","GA","Thank you for taking time to read our story.About two months ago  Nickie and I asked for prayer on social media. At that time  we were intentionally vague as we wanted to be respectful of our son Joshua's privacy  as well as give ourselves some time to sort things out and to process what exactly our family was facing. Since then  we learned that our son Josh (21 years old) was going through a psychosis event. Without getting into the personal details  Mental Health America (MHA) defines psychosis as a mental disorder characterized by a disconnection from reality  and is a general term to describe a set of symptoms of mental illnesses that result in strange or persistent thoughts  perceptions  behaviors  and emotions. We took Josh to the hospital and he underwent psychological treatment for the next 7 days in an in-patient facility. Unfortunately  it was more of a holding facility than a treatment facility and the overall experience was more traumatic than helpful  leaving us with as many questions as answers. He has since been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist every couple of weeks  but the treatment does not appear to be coordinated. As a result  he is not making the strides we were hoping and praying for and is really struggling to get better. Most recently  he entered another psychosis event  making it extremely difficult for him to communicate his thoughts with any clarity. However  on Sunday  November 4th  and several times since then  Josh asked for help and he is eager to get admitted into a facility that can provide the professional expertise he needs while equipping him with the tools and resources enabling him to not merely cope  but to experience long term health  wholeness  and Christ-centered transformation. With that in mind  we diligently began researching our options and found what we believe to be the perfect facility. The Honey Lake Clinic  located four and a half  hours away  in Greenville  FL  is the #1 Christian mental health program in the US offering individualized 24/7 care. (More info can be found on their website   www.honeylake.clinic)Honey Lake Clinic offers Bible-based  psychological care by licensed experts in scenic  world-class accommodations and has an incredible reputation for helping their residents reclaim their lives and achieve their God-given potential. Quite frankly  there is not another facility in the country that compares. Honey Lake Clinic only offers a residential program with a 30 day minimum stay  but after speaking with the staff  and acquainting them with Josh's unique situation  they felt he would be a great fit. With excitement  Nickie  Josh and I began to jump through the initial hoops  but our hearts sank when we found out that our health insurance would not cover any of the costs and self pay patients must have payment in full prior to admission. Instead of accepting this as the end of the road  and after much prayer and consideration  we have decided to reach out to our extended family  friends  and anyone else who would be generous enough in partnering with us to help with the costs and facilitate this amazing opportunity for Josh.The cost for 30 days is an overwhelming $30 000. Thankfully  the facility offered us a $12 000 scholarship  leaving a cost of $18 000. There are some other costs as well  and 80% of the residents stay longer.

Most cancer patients spend more for out of pocket medical expenses than was anticipated.  Sean was lucky that he was able to continue working while undergoing chemotherapy last fall.  Unfortunately  he hasn't been able to return to work due to complications from his treatment.  His future treatment plan is not yet finalized but will include more chemotherapy  radiation and surgeries.   We have set up this page to help Sean and Vickey with the cost of current and future expenses. While being treated Sean worked with the American Cancer Society to effect change in Maine state law to require health insurance to cover cancer screening for younger patients.  He was hoping to testify at a public hearing on this bill but was back in the hospital and had his statement read before the legislators instead.  Below Sean will give you his story in his own words:I am Sean Riley of Falmouth  ME husband and father of a daughter and son. I am currently recuperating from my 2nd of several anticipated cancer surgeries.  I still recall the sinking look on my wife Vickey's face when we were told that I had cancer. In my heart I knew something was not right but when those words are spoken it officially becomes your family's most life changing moment.  I am an otherwise healthy individual and never expected to be battling cancer in my mid 40's. I am 6 ft 178 lbs and see my doctor annually and have little to complain about medically. My cancer story starts back in spring of 2018 when I noticed some small rectal bleeding and blood in my stools. While alarming  I initially didn't think it was significant enough to rush to the emergency room. I wondered if I ate something bad  had a virus or was this really blood at all? My older sister had several large polyps removed in the summer of 2017 and her doctor recommended all her siblings be proactive and be screened too. I waited a week and then discussed it with my wife and told her I was reaching out to my Primary Care Doctor and requesting a colorectal cancer screening asap. Unfortunately it took several weeks to get into my primary care and then 5 months to have a colonoscopy. This waiting time was not easy  symptoms did not stop and I continued on with life hoping for the best results during my scope in the fall.  Unfortunately my results revealed stage 2 colorectal cancer that spread to my liver. I was quickly entered into a treatment plan. Thankfully after reviewing my colonoscopy results and some additional testing my medical team concluded my cancer was treatable  operable and survivable. It would be a long fall  winter and spring with 2 rounds of chemotherapy  radiation and several cancer surgeries. I continued working and driving the kids to and from school daily (400 miles a week). Chemotherapy was Oct through Christmas and then a week of amped up Radiation treatment ended in January of 2019.   I had my first surgery Feb 12th which was successful in removing the tumor from my colon. I returned home and to work 12 days later. Unfortunately after recovering from my surgery I developed a nasty infection. My return to work lasted 1 day as severe lower back pain sent me back to the operating table. A procedure to place a pelvic drain in my right buttock (haha) was used along with antibiotics to reduce the infection. This was a torturous 3 plus weeks. The infection pain was relentless even with painkillers and the drain location was just as painful as I was unable to sit or even lie on my back for more than a few minutes. Worse  the sutures that would allow me to reverse my iliostomy were leaking  causing fluid to create a pocket right below my tailbone. This meant delays in healing and moving forward to treat the liver cancer and reattaching my digestive system to normal functions. Unfortunately tissue is often damaged and weak from radiation making surgical recovery complicated. I was readmitted to the hospital for a week of IV medication and pain management.  In late March the decision was made to operate again after CT scan revealed my sutures were not sealing. The procedure was to clean the infection  move the pelvic drain to the front abdomen where it is less painful  check colon sutures and transplant healthy abdominal tissue into the infected pocket to promote blood flow and healing.I am now home again. I am not on pain killers anymore yeah... I am recovering and gaining strength slowly after dropping 20 lbs post surgeries and 30 lbs overall. I now resemble the skinny kid you remember (with gray hair...) I hope to return to work soon. Missing work has been tough both financially and personally. I can count on 1 hand the number of days I had missed work in 29 years. Vickey and the kids have been strong but it has been tough on everyone including family far and near. I am not a social media person I would much rather be in the company of the ones I care about than send a text  post or tweet (remember the Dominican...) Unfortunately that isn't always possible as we live such hectic lives. I was asked if I would be interested in a go fund page and I was initially hesitant. After hearing family members tell me about relatives and friends reaching out and their desire to help this made our decision easier. I am not private about my fight against cancer in fact I hope my story will help another family or individual choose to get screened. As I told the American Cancer Society and wrote in my statement to the State Legislature  if I can help one person not have too suffer the way I have then I will do whatever I can. Funds will go to paying my medical expenses including the copays  coinsurance and patient portions of bills that do and will continue to pile up. I was meticulous about not letting one bill get overlooked as our family is getting ready to close on our new home in Brunswick Maine. While I was recovering I worked with the American Cancer Society in Maine to help pass legislation (LD555) to lower cancer screening ages requiring medical insurance to pay for earlier tests for at risk patients to age 45 instead of 50. This adheres to the new medical guidelines. If you are 45 ask your doctor about being screened for colorectal cancer as it is the 2nd highest cancer killer in the country. If I was screened at 50 my situation would have not been as optimistic. Enough preaching.... Hopefully this summer I will be recovered from liver surgery and finishing 3 months of chemo  and starting a new chapter of my life as a cancer survivor and advocate. Peace and Love to you all Sean Vickey Nia Nevin Thank you for considering donating to Sean and his family and for sharing this page with anyone you feel would like to help!"

It can wreak havoc on one's finances and the ability to just keep paying the bills in order to live.  Anyone facing the daunting task of healing and getting well shouldn't have to worry about going bankrupt or losing everything.  It's very clear that Jenny will be unable to work and while she has health insurance  it will not cover the cost of all her care. It's time now for us to send all the care and support we can spare to see her through the enormous challenges that lie ahead.  Anything  even the smallest amount  that you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Everything we can do to envelope her with healing thoughts and love is incredibly important so that her energy can be focused on beating this thing.  I will be posting regular updates and if you feel so inclined  please spread the word.  I thank you and I know Jenny thanks you from the bottom of her heart."

It was a very rainy morning  and he was heading to work to help a client get ready to leave the country. Jay’s brakes went out on his car. In a desperate moment  taking quick action to avoid hitting or hurting anyone else  he used his emergency brake and swerved into a tree.  The accident was bad and Jay is badly injured.  What we know so far is that he’s in the Trauma ICU unit with multiple injuries  including a broken back and is unable to lift his arms.  Jay is a hairdresser  lives alone in Dallas  TX and does not have health insurance.Current Situation:On Monday  February 11th  2019.  Friends were able to briefly visit Jay in the ICU.  At the time he couldn’t move his legs and only slightly move his hands.  To our knowledge his family lives in Arkansas.  He was receiving a breathing treatment when we managed to see him.We apologize for the limited information.  We are not family and due to HIPAA the hospital will only give us very limited information.   The true extent of his injuries is still unknown. We have no idea how long he will be in the hospital or how long his rehabilitation will take.  We will make updates to the campaign as soon as we have more news from the hospital doctors. Jay is very worried about how he will pay for the hospital  doctors  his rent and just survive without an income.  He feels terribly alone and has no one to help him but his friends.  Not having insurance  the hospital will soon start pressuring him to make payments which he is unable to afford. We would greatly appreciate it if you can help in any way. He’s in God's hands. Please pray for him. About Jay (James Long):Jay is seen by everyone that knows him as completely unselfish.  Every time you are around Jay  he is completely focused on you and never himself.  He has always been a ray of sunshine for anyone that came into contact with him.  He remembers everything you’ve ever told him about yourself or your family and is always quick to recall and ask about you and your family.  We need to give some of that back to him -- the care and love he deserves and needs.How will the fund be used?:The funds will be used to pay for Jay’s outstanding medical bills and living expenses.  The hospital bill he is facing will no doubt be astronomical. Our Message to you:  We would like to thank each and every one of you for any and all prayers  shares  or donations to help Jay through this incredibly difficult time. We’d like to have all of you who are able  to please visit Jay.  He will appreciate all the love and support anyone can give.  Every call and message will help him and give him a little more hope and strength to push on and fight for a full recovery."

Our hope is to continue her acute inpatient stay at TIRR Memorial Herman until early March and to see continuing improvement.  Thereafter  Mia will be transitioned to a subacute outpatient rehabilitation facility for an additional three to six-month stay at one of several candidate facilities  including The Centre for Neuro Skills and Pate Rehabilitation Hospital.Unfortunately  rehabilitation is extremely expensive - with a daily rate of over $3 200 for 45 days at TIRR Memorial Herman  and it is being paid for out-of-pocket to enable Mia’s ongoing medical care.  Like many physicians  who worked as contractors  Mia did not qualify for health insurance through an employer  so she purchased individual insurance.  Sadly this (and every other) individual health insurance plan does not cover rehabilitation costs at TIRR Memorial Herman or elsewhere.  Following her release from TIRR  the subacute outpatient care will cost between $850 and $1 100 daily  and insurance will not cover these costs either.    We’re asking for your help with the cost of her stay at TIRR so that Mia can continue on the path to recovery and resume her life as the active mother of two beautiful teen-aged daughters  partner to fiancé Ted  loving daughter and sister  and an amazing friend to so many.  Our family is deeply grateful for your help in Mia’s journey to recovery.  Your contributions  prayers and supportive words are invaluable.  - Rose"

Troy Roark sat in for him on drums.  I checked my texts on the first break ….. “I’m just going to put it out there” the text began  it was from Nat  “I’m in really bad shape  I have Acute Myeloid Leukemia  I’ll be in the hospital at least 4 weeks.”  My heart literally sank into my stomach  I gasped  “acute”  this diagnosis is a very tough one and a massive uphill fight – long  long term.  Nat is committed to following the team of Doctor’s orders.  Many of you know Nat as a drummer and hand percussionist and real estate appraiser.  Others know him from The Cross Fit Community and even others from Barnes & Noble  Custom Cup Coffee or his recent favorite coffee haunt Three Twigs Bakery.  Nat has made friends from all walks of life and he and his family have been generous to those in need.   They hosted a foreign exchange student from the Netherlands for a year.   He has hosted/promoted bands  covering costs so that the people of Springfield could experience world class music.  Almost 2 years ago his youngest daughter asked if they could take in a young woman who was in the US on an asylum visa and found herself homeless.   That is how Natasha  a student at Lincoln Land  became part of the Radwine family.  Name a holiday and the Radwines will have an extra seat at their family table filled with someone who had nowhere to go.  Many of you will remember  back in the day Nat and his brother David owned Crow’s Mill School where they had legendary bands and served memorable food.  Nat’s heart is totally in his family (Carol  Zack  with Courtney and the grandkids  Zoe  Mira and “informally adopted” daughter Natasha)  his dogs Stella and CoCo  his bandmates and his community.  Now he needs our help.  Being self-employed  Nat has no paid benefit time and his income stopped cold on March 16th when he was admitted to Memorial  where he remains  receiving treatment.  He is fortunate to have good health insurance through Carol’s job but his ability to earn a living has been put on hold and treatments will be ongoing for months or years.   Their youngest daughter Mira is a sophomore at SIU-E  and before this diagnosis  Nat and Carol’s plan was to keep working well past college expenses.  A bone marrow transplant may be needed which would require him to be transferred to Barnes in St. Louis.  When he was admitted to Memorial  doctors and nurses told them it would be a long road  but that is only beginning to sink in.  The Radwine family needs our help.  Can you be generous?  REALLY generous?  Can you help the Radwines?  Nat and Carol have always been quick and generous contributors to any good cause  (including opening their home and wallet to others in BIG ways)  and now they need us.  If not us  who?  If not now  when?Please give the absolute best gift you can  put yourself in Nat’s place  or in Carol’s.  Would you want to count on your friends to pitch in?  And please PLEASE share this campaign with all of your friends and family.Thanks so much from us  his Emerald Underground Bandmates  and from Nat  Carol  Zack (Courtney and grandkids)  Zoe  Mira and Natasha"

This is unfortunately where we find our dear friend Holly Phares  after an infection on the skin of her ankle took a turn for the worse  and spread to the bone. Doctors at Jefferson Hospital have performed the necessary surgery to help save her foot  but she now faces an extended hospital stay as her rehabilitation and physical therapy become paramount. It's more than likely she will  transfer to another facility  or much to her chagrin a nursing home  where she will continue her PT and OT. Her beloved Comfort Cottage is not wheelchair accessible so any rehab there seems unlikely.  She has multiple IVs running very strong antibiotics into her system on a regular basis. This treatment will continue for 6 weeks.Due to the soaring cost of health insurance  Holly finds herself uninsured and facing what is sure to be extensive medical bills and lost wages. She works many jobs as a musician  and makes just enough money to keep her from qualifying for Medicare. She is working with a social worker and others from the hospital to apply for as much assistance as possible. Holly wants you to know she is in great hands at Jefferson. She feels safe and cared for  and has miraculously ended up with a private room. She is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love she has received and is eternally grateful. I spent almost an hour on the phone with her tonight  and haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  My name is Ryan Fleming. I am her friend  student and colleague. She has thousands of these friends all over the world  and cherishes each one of us. Won't you please consider donating to help Holly navigate this very stressful and scary time in her life. Money raised here would mean more than just bills paid  it would mean peace of mind and a return to the life she so cherishes.Blessing to you all!Ryan"

Over the past decade the disease has escalated its efforts to weaken his body  but it hasn’t weakened his spirit or sense of humor. He’s been through a kidney transplant  experienced vision impairment  had multiple amputations ultimately leading to two leg amputations  and more. Through it all he’s continued to be an amazing father and friend.The LatestAt the end of 2017 Dan underwent his second leg amputation. The surgery was successful  but it took time for it to heal and for him to learn how to walk with two prosthetics. Additionally  he experienced several other health issues that doctors are still trying to figure out.As Dan tried to work though all of this in early 2018  the WA Department of Revenue decided it was time to audit his company. However  since he was in and out of the hospital and dealing with his health and recovery  Dan couldn’t respond in time  so the Department of Revenue executed a “desk audit” and without any documentation or evidence from Dan they determined he owed over $250k to the state.From there the state garnished all his money causing Dan to miss a couple health insurance premium payments  leading to the cancellation of his health insurance. Since then we’ve spent months trying to figure out how to get coverage for Dan  how to deal with the state  and most importantly how to solve the myriad of health issues he’s dealing with daily.We believe we are on the right track but unfortunately the costs for continued medical treatment and life-sustaining medications are extremely high making it hard to keep up with medications and doctor appointments  ultimately causing additional health issues.  Why GoFundMe?We are trying to raise money to cover Dan’s medical and basic living expenses for a couple of months  so we can make sure he gets his medications  makes it to his doctors appointments and so he can focus on obtaining insurance coverage  getting resolution on the state issue  and getting his body back to normal. By donating or sharing this GoFundMe to others you’d be helping an amazing father and friend through a difficult time. We thank you for your consideration in sharing his story and/or donating.We know if there’s one thing Dan is not shorted by  it is the amount of love and support you have provided him. Thank you from us both.Justin & Morgan"

I am 1 in 10. I am 31 years old and I have stage 4 endometriosis and had stage 4 Adenomyosis. There is no cure for these illnesses  and the lack of coverage of healthcare and my medical bills  are drowning me.  As private as I am and have been  my back is against the wall and for my health's sake  I am hoping this can help me. I was diagnosed ten years ago but recent years it has gotten to a point where I have lost a part of myself entirely  I have gone through chemotherapy twice in the last year  7 surgeries in all (since diagnosis ) with another on the way  chemically induced menopause 3 times  a total abdominal hysterectomy in December and last but not least  my ovaries -- being the only organ of my reproductive system I was able to keep after surgery  which is a very vital organ; has now failed me. So thats six organs  an ENTIRE ORGAN SYSTEM that I have lost within a year. Which now leads me into  trying to figure out my life from here  with being on medication for the rest of my life and just sort of coming into my own that I can not have my own child  I can never freeze an egg  that is a chapter of mine I have to close and find closure and comfort within myself in time. The last few years of my life are a blur of tests  throwing up  crying  sleeping on bathroom floors  surgeries  chemo  sleeping in the shower with the water falling on me  being in constant horrible pain  being in the hospital  losing my hair  being poked and pried with constant tests invasively  and because of it all I have become extremely shut off. I have finally been able to come to a part of my journey where I am letting my walls come crashing down  because if I don't open  up and reach out -- I don't know that my mental can take much more. I know people often question where I went  or what happened-- so here I am  letting my walls down with raw honesty. I am drowning in medical bills  sure health insurance does help but not all medication  treatments  tests  surgeries   co insurances -- are all not covered. I'm opening up because I am looking to bring awareness  to get my health back and get back to MORE LIFE. I want to inspire  show all the girls that will come after me going through the same thing that they are NOT ALONE! For so many years I was told so many different things  they tried so many things and it just made it worse.I have been a science experiment for a long time and I am truly tired. I have now found a doctor who has a very good plan for me to get my health back  my insurance doesn't cover a lot of the bills  and especially this last year with chemo and my hysterectomy things got very expensive   so with that being said I have decided to put up a go fund me. This is a no pressure situation  I would never judge a single soul for not donating  It took me a lot of thinking about even putting myself out there like this  if I would be judged or looked at weird -- but to be honest  I just want to be healthy and get my life back so I can love life again and bring positivity to the world and be comfortable in my own skin. I want to share my story with the world and save the future from having to go through the torture I have endured from an\"invisible illness\". Maybe with me  they can find a better route to help the future. It is referred to as an invisible illness  there is no medical imaging to detect it  every time they need to check out whats going on inside of someone like me -- they have to do it through laparoscopy ( a camera surgery they stick in your abdomen)  So with all this being said  I would appreciate it and promise to bring awareness to this physical and emotional massacre of an illness that someone at such a young age has to endure. I just want my life back. Thank you for even taking the time to read this and Thank you to the ones who end up donating to help me with my medical bills  I appreciate you all and Sending love to you all  if anyone knows anyone who can relate and needs someone to talk to -- please contact me.  I am here. Love First  Love Always. More Life  JackieArtwork done by: Amar Stewart"

Crazy how much things can change overnight. I sit here hooked up to IV’s finishing up my first day of chemo and felt it a good time to send an update. For those who don’t know  a month ago I was diagnosed with a unicorn cancer of the vagina. Its called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina and is the first in the state of WI  less than 50 cases ever have been reported.I had surgery to remove a cyst at the beginning of January which had been bothering me for months. My lack of health insurance  fear of out of pocket costs and the fact that I’m stubborn prevented me from addressing the issue earlier. Due to the aggressiveness of the cancer doctors are sure I haven’t had it very long. I had a second surgery two weeks ago to remove affected lymph nodes. I just had my first radiation treatment  which will be 5 days a week for the next two months. Thursday I started chemo and will most likely start another treatment called immunotherapy  after radiation is complete.The next few months are going to be forever changing. I want everyone to know that I am honestly OK. Regardless of the future  I’m OK. I’ve accepted what’s taking place and embracing this as a learning and growth opportunity. I will be losing my hair  I will have physical and emotional struggles but  I am more than prepared to fight this. Much of this is out of my control  but I can control my attitude. I’m staying positive and am still feeling grateful.Please understand that I may not be able to respond to messages or calls. I have a lot going on. I appreciate the outpouring of love and support. Feel free to send funny  inappropriate or happy texts  messages or snaps. I will keep you all updated. Much love!***Many of you know and love Tasha Cheney.

She has been unable to return to work as a kindergarten teacher. I’d like to share her story now.Meredith has always been a healthy active person. She was a swimmer. She chased after a daughter and her 2 twin boys  now 16 and 13 years old  and cheered them on through soccer  baseball and football games. She was even willing to manage other people’s children as an elementary school teacher! Kindergarten no less! She  herself  runs primarily on Mountain Dew  which I will never understand. But I guess we all have our vices. She also worked in extended day  spending her afternoons running around playgrounds with these kids after a day teaching kindergarten. Until this fall. When her vision changed. And she developed a few other weird neurological symptoms. And then had to pull off the road after school and call for a ride to the ER because her symptoms had worsened to the point she didn’t feel safe to drive.She was hospitalized  underwent a brain biopsy for a suspicious mass. And shortly after came the news- Brain Cancer. Non-Operable. Not curable. The plan is to begin chemotherapy and radiation to destroy as much of the cancer as possible.  It is unknown whether her vision will improve. It is unknown when or even if she will be able to return to work. It is unknown how much time we have left with Meredith. We do know that  even with health insurance  she will have mounting medical bills. She has already started receiving the bills for her ER visit and hospitalization. And continued living expenses  including her mortgage and utility payments. She will run out of paid leave within 1-2 months  even with the donation of leave time by her generous fellow teachers- thank you! Meredith is 44 years old. Her daughter is 16  a junior in high school  a member of the national honor society and thinking about where she will go to college. Her twin boys are 13 years old  8th graders  and thinking about their next moves on Fortnite and how to complete homework as quickly as humanly possible. Please help support Meredith during this time. Please consider donating to this fund so Meredith can focus on her children  her family and friends and her upcoming treatment with one less worry. Your donations will be used for medical expenses and to help cover her and her children’s living costs.

How her story ends is up to you. Help us get an asylum-seeking world-changer back to her Ivy League full-ride (and to selflessly serving those in need) by sponsoring her medical recovery.WHERE HOPE IS NOWAmazingly  Hope has already seen substantial health improvements when she’s been able to access consistent medical help. She’s determined to re-enroll at her Ivy League University during the '19/'20 school year  exact time dependent on her recovery speed. However  she’s exhausted her money for medical treatment and currently eats at homeless shelters. She’s legally in the US since she’s applied for refugee status  but during the slow wait for approval  she is barred from all state/federal support services such as Medicaid.If Hope stays in the US without the medical support to return to her Ivy League University  her untreated health issues will likely end her life  or render her permanently hospitalized.If Hope goes back to her home country  her family will most likely find her and kill her in the name of protecting the family’s honor.This is more than just Hope's life  though. Hope worked extensively in high school with non-profits which empower vulnerable women and girls  and intends to leverage her American education to continue that world-changing work. Hope’s recovery would mean uplifting for so many beyond just her.WHAT HOPE NEEDS TO RECOVERThis is where you come in. Your support will cover the basic needs crucial to Hope’s recovery over the next 8 months and re-enrolling at her Ivy League University the '19/'20 school year:Monthly costs:Health Insurance: $500Medical co-pays: $450Medicines (inc.inhaler  supplements): $250Wellness (gymn  yoga etc): $200Transport: $100Events  conferences  etc: $120Food  groceries etc: $180Therapy: $200Housing: $0 (thanks to a very generous someone!)Total: $2 000/monthJan-April Costs update:Actual avg cost per month for first 4 months (Jan-April): $2 700/month or $10 800 total spent.

It is managed by Eleanor Collier  who has extensive experience handling budgets from running student organizations and working as a residence assistant at Stanford  and who currently manages a research laboratory . Each month  Eleanor works with Hope to calculate precisely the funds needed at the most granular level possible (individual medical costs  food  transportation  classes  etc)  withdraws that amount from GoFundMe to Eleanor's bank account  then sends the funds directly to Hope via Venmo (both transactions  produce a digital record we're happy to provide for verification; following this method of transfer also means funds are being sent and used exactly for the purposes outlined here as verified by Eleanor). Eleanor then records the exact breakdown of expenses in a secure document  and Hope keeps records on-hand of where money gets actually spent  which Eleanor reviews before sending the next month's money (records are kept private for privacy reasons  but Eleanor's happy to answer questions or provide more details about breakdowns  without compromising privacy). Our aim is 100% transparency and accountability  so we're eager to provide any additional details you'd like.Will this actually help Hope long-term  rather than just make her dependent on others?Yes. 100% of the money will go to directly put Hope back in her Ivy League University  where she’s studying computer science  a program which will position her atop the financially lucrative technology job market  and more able than ever to build solutions to help the vulnerable woman and girls she worked extensively with in high school. The medical treatment will also increasingly restore her ability to work and support herself in the short term.Hope is fiercely independent. She has been incredibly hesitant to receive outside support because she doesn't want to lean on others. She finally agreed to support because she knows it is the only option for her to be fully independent in very the near future.How can I be sure this isn’t a scam? Why can’t I know Hope’s full name?Eleanor Collier (Eleanor.A.Collier ‘at’ dartmouth ‘dot’ edu)  David Mora (davidmora ‘at ‘cs.stanford.edu)  Nikhil Desai (nikhildesai ‘at’ google ‘dot’ com)  and Danish Shabbir all personally know Hope and vet her story. We’d be happy to call with you to address concerns and share 3rd party verification. For privacy and safety reasons  however  we’re not publishing Hope’s identity publicly on the web.I'm short on money but rich in love. Are there other ways I can help Hope?Yes! Please contact Eleanor Collier Eleanor Collier (Eleanor.A.Collier ‘at’ dartmouth ‘dot’ edu) or David Mora (davidmora ‘at‘ cs.stanford.edu) for more info on other ways you can contribute to Hope's material and emotional needs."

We spent our days being home schooled by our mother  traveling on missionary trips to Romania and the Philippines and helping our parents with the developmentally disabled adults they cared for. In 2010  our mama was diagnosed with Breast Cancer where she fought a courageous battle for years until 2012. When we lost our mama  our world turned upside down. In 2014  our papa suffered from a minor stroke and a heart attack to follow a few months later. He remained healthy and strong following.In 2015  papa started school for welding and metal fabrication at WCTC which he really loved. He also worked as a Tae Kwon Do instructor for years...he is so great with the young kids and thoroughly enjoyed being a part of their accomplishments! Most recently  papa's been working as a maintenance manager at an apartment complex. But his recent big love is working as security and roadie for the band  The Crisis. Our family has grown over the years with the people who've entered our lives through those avenues.On Monday morning  our papa suffered a major stroke with a serious brain bleed. He also was diagnosed with a mild heart attack and aspiration pneumonia. Papa was medically sedated to allow his brain to heal. This week has been a long road for us. While we are trying make sense of papa  there are many other things we  as his children  have been faced with. Beside medical decisions  we are faced with responsibilities we were not prepared to handle.  We are now faced with paying all the bills  including mortgage- electric- phones- home/vehicle insurance and Aubrey's Badger Care/health insurance. There is no credit card debt nor any other excess spending. We live modest  if we can't pay for it  we don't buy it. Papa currently does not have health insurance either  however we are working with a social worker to file for Badger Care. He was denied for October which includes 3 days of this hospital stay. We are praying they approve him for November. We are working on trying to get the bills paid for this month. We do not have access to our papa's bank accounts so we have no idea what financial situation we are facing. We do live paycheck to paycheck. Our situation is very precarious as papa did not have a Power of Attorney or Advance Directive so until the court can appoint a guardian  we need to be sure we are able to care for ourselves and our home. Papa's medical status is very critical. He is paralyzed on his entire right side and his left side has little to no voluntary movement. His brain bleed has not gotten any better and the swelling in his head remains the same as when he was admitted into the ICU.  Papa's condition is on a day by day basis- we don't know what tomorrow will bring but we pray for God's healing hands. He is still in the ICU and will remain for the unforeseeable future. We have been taught by our parents to work hard and we do. Aubrey has started school this week and we know that we will need to get full time jobs to care for ourselves and papa. Our papa was never one to ask for assistance or help financially and it's really difficult to accept the position we are in. We pray that we can have time to be with our papa and our family during this difficult time and not need to worry about making sure we have a home to return to.  We know that the help we receive now  will be paid back to others in our future. Please Pray for our papa and our family.Thank you for all the love and support TJ  Shaphan and Aubrey Nabong*Many have asked how they can help in additional ways.

Our hope is to continue her acute inpatient stay at TIRR Memorial Herman until early March and to see continuing improvement.  Thereafter  Mia will be transitioned to a subacute outpatient rehabilitation facility for an additional three to six-month stay at one of several candidate facilities  including The Centre for Neuro Skills and Pate Rehabilitation Hospital.Unfortunately  rehabilitation is extremely expensive - with a daily rate of over $3 200 for 45 days at TIRR Memorial Herman  and it is being paid for out-of-pocket to enable Mia’s ongoing medical care.  Like many physicians  who worked as contractors  Mia did not qualify for health insurance through an employer  so she purchased individual insurance.  Sadly this (and every other) individual health insurance plan does not cover rehabilitation costs at TIRR Memorial Herman or elsewhere.  Following her release from TIRR  the subacute outpatient care will cost between $850 and $1 100 daily  and insurance will not cover these costs either.    We’re asking for your help with the cost of her stay at TIRR so that Mia can continue on the path to recovery and resume her life as the active mother of two beautiful teen-aged daughters  partner to fiancé Ted  loving daughter and sister  and an amazing friend to so many.  Our family is deeply grateful for your help in Mia’s journey to recovery.  Your contributions  prayers and supportive words are invaluable.  - Rose"

Troy Roark sat in for him on drums.  I checked my texts on the first break ….. “I’m just going to put it out there” the text began  it was from Nat  “I’m in really bad shape  I have Acute Myeloid Leukemia  I’ll be in the hospital at least 4 weeks.”  My heart literally sank into my stomach  I gasped  “acute”  this diagnosis is a very tough one and a massive uphill fight – long  long term.  Nat is committed to following the team of Doctor’s orders.  Many of you know Nat as a drummer and hand percussionist and real estate appraiser.  Others know him from The Cross Fit Community and even others from Barnes & Noble  Custom Cup Coffee or his recent favorite coffee haunt Three Twigs Bakery.  Nat has made friends from all walks of life and he and his family have been generous to those in need.   They hosted a foreign exchange student from the Netherlands for a year.   He has hosted/promoted bands  covering costs so that the people of Springfield could experience world class music.  Almost 2 years ago his youngest daughter asked if they could take in a young woman who was in the US on an asylum visa and found herself homeless.   That is how Natasha  a student at Lincoln Land  became part of the Radwine family.  Name a holiday and the Radwines will have an extra seat at their family table filled with someone who had nowhere to go.  Many of you will remember  back in the day Nat and his brother David owned Crow’s Mill School where they had legendary bands and served memorable food.  Nat’s heart is totally in his family (Carol  Zack  with Courtney and the grandkids  Zoe  Mira and “informally adopted” daughter Natasha)  his dogs Stella and CoCo  his bandmates and his community.  Now he needs our help.  Being self-employed  Nat has no paid benefit time and his income stopped cold on March 16th when he was admitted to Memorial  where he remains  receiving treatment.  He is fortunate to have good health insurance through Carol’s job but his ability to earn a living has been put on hold and treatments will be ongoing for months or years.   Their youngest daughter Mira is a sophomore at SIU-E  and before this diagnosis  Nat and Carol’s plan was to keep working well past college expenses.  A bone marrow transplant may be needed which would require him to be transferred to Barnes in St. Louis.  When he was admitted to Memorial  doctors and nurses told them it would be a long road  but that is only beginning to sink in.  The Radwine family needs our help.  Can you be generous?  REALLY generous?  Can you help the Radwines?  Nat and Carol have always been quick and generous contributors to any good cause  (including opening their home and wallet to others in BIG ways)  and now they need us.  If not us  who?  If not now  when?Please give the absolute best gift you can  put yourself in Nat’s place  or in Carol’s.  Would you want to count on your friends to pitch in?  And please PLEASE share this campaign with all of your friends and family.Thanks so much from us  his Emerald Underground Bandmates  and from Nat  Carol  Zack (Courtney and grandkids)  Zoe  Mira and Natasha"

This is unfortunately where we find our dear friend Holly Phares  after an infection on the skin of her ankle took a turn for the worse  and spread to the bone. Doctors at Jefferson Hospital have performed the necessary surgery to help save her foot  but she now faces an extended hospital stay as her rehabilitation and physical therapy become paramount. It's more than likely she will  transfer to another facility  or much to her chagrin a nursing home  where she will continue her PT and OT. Her beloved Comfort Cottage is not wheelchair accessible so any rehab there seems unlikely.  She has multiple IVs running very strong antibiotics into her system on a regular basis. This treatment will continue for 6 weeks.Due to the soaring cost of health insurance  Holly finds herself uninsured and facing what is sure to be extensive medical bills and lost wages. She works many jobs as a musician  and makes just enough money to keep her from qualifying for Medicare. She is working with a social worker and others from the hospital to apply for as much assistance as possible. Holly wants you to know she is in great hands at Jefferson. She feels safe and cared for  and has miraculously ended up with a private room. She is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love she has received and is eternally grateful. I spent almost an hour on the phone with her tonight  and haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  My name is Ryan Fleming. I am her friend  student and colleague. She has thousands of these friends all over the world  and cherishes each one of us. Won't you please consider donating to help Holly navigate this very stressful and scary time in her life.

On 12/22/2019  Taylor felt a lump in her left breast and five weeks later  she was in her first chemotherapy session. She's been diagnosed with Stage 2A invasive ductal carcinoma  a very common  yet aggressive breast cancer. She is early stage  with a ER+  PR+  HER2- pathology (a favorable treatment profile). The doctors and Taylor have a good outlook  and she is looking forward to being on the other side of this  with new eyes full of wisdom! She does have a tough road ahead. She will begin with 5 months of ACT chemotherapy (the hard stuff) to shrink the tumor  then on to surgery  and 5-10 years of hormone therapy. She is a full-time biologist for our nearby coast and ocean  and while she will continue working part time  she will have to give up a lot of field work during treatment  as it requires handling dead animals. Taylor has been on the Bay Area hustle of also bartending at the Rite Spot  and has to let that source of income go to focus one healing and recovery. During the next year  she won't be able to work the 50 hours/week she's accustomed to. She is incredibly grateful to have good health insurance  but the costs of care and recovery in the Bay Area are tough when your hustle has been put on hold. Taylor says  “I know many of you out there also need a hand just as much  if not more. Smiles  hugs  prayers  and jokes are also warmly accepted!\"And if you feel moved to give  it is with deep gratitude and humbleness that she accepts your kindness.

Since that date  she's been recovering in the ICU where she remains in critical condition.  The doctors are unsure how long she will stay in the ICU  but she could be there for 21-45 days.  Once she is done in ICU she will go to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital where she will receive OT  PT  and Speech Therapy.  Due to her injury  Rebecca will need to re-learn many skills such as walking  talking  and other activities of daily living.  Rebecca has health insurance.  However  her plan is a high deductible plan and her insurance will not cover all of her expenses.   It is estimated that out of pocket costs for her injury may exceed $20 000.  Many of our friends and family have asked how they can help.  A donation towards my sisters recovery will help my parents to focus on her recovery without the stress of wondering how they will cover the costs of her treatment.  We are encouraged with her progress and expect a full recovery.   Thank you for considering a donation towards her recovery."

Some of you may not. Those of us that know Julie know she is incredibly gifted at finding ways to bring light to those around her. She would rather give than receive and would rather spread smiles than sadness. Many of us have been blessed to be on the receiving end of her infectious laughs  thoughtful compliments  and relentlessly selfless acts of service. Now she needs our help. Just a week before her diagnosis  Julie was downsized from her employment and because of this  she was not able to get health insurance and currently has no income. Although she has diligently researched  fought for  and received a good deal of financial assistance  there are still significant medical bills and life expenses piling up. The PlanDuring her initial hospitalization and diagnosis in July  Julie underwent surgeries to stabilize her immediate health and prepare her for treatment. She has also recently undergone an initial round of chemo and radiation. These first few steps of her treatment are out of the way  but she still has a long journey and significant challenges ahead. The next step is surgical removal of the tumor  followed by recovery and several more months of chemo. We will do our best to post updates here on Julie’s progress as she continues to fight this disease. Julie may also personally share more details and updates here as she feels comfortable disclosing and discussing them. How You Can HelpWe have put together this campaign to help relieve the significant financial burden this situation has placed on Julie  so that she can focus on overcoming the disease. No one should have to face the possibility of bankruptcy due to events completely out of their control. On our own we could do little  but together we can make a monumental impact. Please help our friend face this challenge and give her hope for a return to her ordinary life. Thank you so much for your love and support. XODavid  Rhiannon & Julie’s Cancer Fighting Team!"

Or you may have grown close to him through a shared love of golf  college football  or Americus  GA. For many others  you may only know the family member who requested your support by sharing this GoFundMe page.Regardless of how you know Kellette or his friends and family  the Wade family thanks you for visiting this page and potentially contributing toward the journey ahead.The BackstoryKellette was recently diagnosed with myelofibrosis  a condition of the tissue inside the bone marrow that contains the stem cells that eventually form blood cells. In myelofibrosis  the bone marrow is replaced by scar tissue  and subsequently  there are not enough blood cells created.To address this condition  Kellette will undergo a bone marrow transplant where cells will be taken from the bone marrow of another person  and then transfused into Kellette’s bone marrow to replace the abnormal cells.Following the procedure  Kellette will stay in the hospital for a month as his immune system recovers from the transplant. After this month of treatment  Kellette will able to leave the hospital  but he will be required to live no more than 30 minutes away. This will ensure that if any issues arise  he will have immediate access to the appropriate care essential for a successful recovery.How You Can HelpThis will be a one year process that will involve numerous preparatory treatments  the transplant itself  the quarantine period  and several months living three hours from his home in Americus  Georgia.

He’s a wonderful son  partner  brother  stepdad  and friend. He can’t wait to marry his fiancee Christine. He’s a hard-working and talented carpenter and a gifted chef. He loves live music and travel and a good cup of coffee. And he is always there if you need him. But Josh’s life almost ended on November 25  2018 when he suffered a serious and life-threatening brain bleed. He was rushed to a nearby emergency room and then taken by life flight helicopter to a hospital that specializes in treating serious aneurysms like Josh’s.Josh was one of the lucky ones — he survived. What doctors didn’t tell us at the time was that more than 90% of people in Josh’s situation don’t make it. Doctors also didn’t tell us until later that the small number of people who do survive a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage like Josh’s (the most serious form of aneurysm)  are often in a coma months later. Josh’s experience has been different. He woke up and was able to breathe without life support in just two days.  He made it through a dangerous two weeks when the blood vessels in his brain went into spasms that could have resulted in strokes and his body re-learned to regulate his temperature after daily fevers that threatened his life. Doctors saved Josh with repeated and complicated treatments. Despite the severity of his illness  Josh was walking with the help of a walker – haltingly  with difficulty – within a couple of weeks. He survived in large part because of the excellent medical care he has received. Yet  his recovery has been so unusual that even his doctors and nurses are amazed. They stop by his hospital room just to ask Josh his story. Hospital staff call him the “miracle man.”   The aneurysm left Josh’s body unable to clear fluid from his brain and Josh recently had further surgery to place a permanent shunt to prevent dangerous pressure buildups in his brain. Josh will need lifelong follow-up care with neurologists and other specialists to monitor his health. Josh was in critical condition in the ICU for three weeks. To date  doctors and nurses and air ambulance personnel have provided about $2 million in medical care. Thankfully  health insurance covers a lot of his medical costs  but not all of them. Josh is facing very large medical bills and collections personnel are eager for payment.  It will take hard work and time for Josh to regain his strength. His memory is still fuzzy  he is learning to manage severe headaches that doctors tell us may last weeks or months  and he will need cognitive therapy to sharpen his verbal skills and memory. Doctors can’t say when Josh will be able to go back to work. He will need weeks or months of physical therapy to help him regain function in his left leg and foot. Josh needs your help to complete this miracle. Please consider making a contribution in any amount to support Josh’s efforts in his recovery journey."

The Texas sun sure was a challenge for the big guy  but he found his groove working construction with a long time friend. Unfortunately about 3 months ago  Joe hurt his shoulder and with no health insurance nor funds for medical assistance  he fought thru the pain and proceeded to work a very physical job day in and out. His luck was not great and gained several other injuries mostly impacting his initial injury of his shoulder. As time passed  he became very ill with what hospitals and urgent care stated was the flu. It became unbearable with a 3rd trip to hospital the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving. Again  given antibiotics and pushed along since no medical insurance.  He pushed thru to see friends and family on Thanksgiving. Unknown to all that shared in his presence  that maybe the last time Joe would be seen in his larger than life self. His mother had not heard from him since that day and became concerned. She reached out to his long time friend  Joel  to check on him. To his dismay  he found Joe incoherent on the bedroom floor of his apartment. Luckily for Joe  Joel was able to handle his weight and rushed him to the hospital to later get a spinal tap. Result: bacterial meningitis. He was in very bad shape and no estimates could be given for his survival. He was transferred to a new hospital with an isolated ICU to begin the road to recovery. Here  the hospital also learned that he had a severe infection of the blood and the infection had been pumping thru his body for a length of time.  It was touch and go the 1st week. Luckily  Joe is a big guy and his body was able to handle the stress!! After getting diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes as well  the doctors/nurses struggled to keep him stable. slowly Joe started to become coherent. Break thru in week 2! Large abscess was found in the shoulder that he injured so many months ago  the size of a baseball that started to solidify. Surgeons went to work ridding his body of the infectious abscess. With a pump  lots of IV antibiotics Joe is coming around. The source of all the illnesses and pain that was plaguing his body was found! He is on a LONG road to recovery! Joe will be in the hospital until all bacteria levels are back to normal in his blood  blood/sugar levels are kept normal and body temperature stable. Doctors have no idea as it is a day by day process with many tests. We hope  for all the doctors/nurses sake that Joe is back at home on the mend as his over the top personality is hard to contain!! Once released he will have to undergo IV antibiotic treatments everyday for 4-6 weeks.as well as starting a new regimen with insulin and diet. IF this was all he is up against  that would be AMAZING!  However  the blood infection pumped thru his whole body affecting his heart and muscles. He is very weak and cannot walk or get up on his own. road to recovery is 3-6 months once final treatments are made. At the end  the hope is that he is back to his vibrant self!! Joe has been trying to stay cheery and be proactive. working with a social worker to hopefully obtain some level of charitable health insurance and possibly disability. The social worker is not optimistic about much aid coming thru. With no health insurance  or savings his family has been helping pay his rent until he can get back on his feet  no pun intended... I am reaching out to all his friends and family that he has spread his contagious laugh and witty personality with to help Joe on his journey from death bed to life! He will need help with medical bills  medications  therapy  and everyday life expenses until we see him on his feet ready to share large hugs with all!"

The family stayed in the pediatric ER all night until Olivia was stable enough to be admitted.  I must admit I really didn't realize the seriousness or severity of this disease until the coming days.  In a matter of a couple hours  Olivia's innocent 2 year old life along with her families was turned upside down.  Olivia’s parents were told in the ER at Beaumont that her levels were over 600 and had they not brought her in when they did  she would’ve been in trouble by the morning.  While in the hospital Olivia was being poked at least 8 times per day to check her blood sugar  and she was injected with two types of insulin any where from four to six times per day on top of numerous tests and lab work.  Mom took a month off work  and Dad took a week.  With a family of 4 kids and 2 adults  mom and dad both work full time to make ends meet.  Olivia couldn't go back to daycare until her blood sugar was regulated and mom could figure out how she would be able to monitor her levels and how she would get her insulin.  Children with Type 1 Diabetes need to be monitored 24 hours a day  even while they sleep so  Olivia was given a continuous glucose monitor to wear.  The monitor tracks Olivia’s blood sugar levels throughout the day and makes the information readily available to her Mom and Dad throughout the day and night of course until little Olivia decides she doesn't need it anymore and rips it off!  Brian and Emilie have decided that because Olivia is so young and doesn't understand her diagnosis or the need for insulin and her monitor  and cannot always communicate how she is feeling  that they need an additional resource to help them keep her safe. After much research the family decided that a diabetic alert dog would be an amazing asset to Olivia’s care team.These dogs are amazing!  They are trained by scent and can tell and alert their companions and caregivers if their blood sugar is either to high or to low  up to 20 minutes before any monitor can.  This is especially important in children as they are not yet able to do the monitoring themselves.  They are trained to bring their companion a snack if they are too low  which can be life saving.  And so much more.Of course insurance does not cover the cost of the Diabetic Alert Dog (DAD)  which can take up to 18 months to train.  Emilie has found a wonderful place to obtain a DAD for Olivia.  They require about a $4000.00 deposit to start training the dog.  Once the dog is trained Olivia and her family will have to travel to where the DAD is located and spend a week with the trainer.  The total cost including travel arrangements are estimated to be around $20 000.00.  There will be an ongoing expense of health insurance for the dog  vet and food expenses as well.  So we are asking for anyone who knows sweet  silly and beautiful little  Olivia  if you are able to help by donating  we all would be eternally greatful!  Please share this with your friends and family also  every dollar we can raise is a dollar to make Olivia’s  life safer!  Thank you so much!"

She always has a smile on her face and an infectious laugh no matter what may be happening in her life. She has received a devastating breast cancer diagnosis as well as a complicating heart valve problem found during her diagnosis  yet with all this bad news she is the one comforting her entire family while searching for a silver lining for herself.After visiting the country of Panama Christie and her daughter  Shelby  fell in love with the people and the country. Living in the country for several years in a small village she embraced the community generously giving her help and support to the village  the indigenous women  and most importantly the children. She has helped teach them English and often provides them with food  toys  and educational supplies. One of her greatest joys is hearing the children shouting \"Christina  Christina!\" happily as she walks through the streets. Christie started her own business \"Pure Panama \" a skincare line in which she purchased her coconut oil from the indigenous women and hired them to work in the production of her products. Her daughter founded a program called \"Light the Path\" to provide solar lanterns to the children to use in their homes to do schoolwork as the sun sets early and the majority of people have no electricity. Christie has had an open heart and never thought that she would be stricken with an aggressive breast cancer. Each facet of the diagnosis kept bringing more critical news including a heart valve problem that limits her ability to receive chemotherapy treatment. She is now facing overwhelming expenses for the surgery and ongoing treatment she needs to receive. She needs our help now more than ever to meet these costs  and any contribution you can make would help make a difference. Christie’s Cancer Story:Christie has recently found out more specific information on her breast cancer as the results have begun coming back. Her cancer has been diagnosed as a very aggressive type called HER2+. Due to numerous factors and the size of her tumor  she is battling Stage 3 of the HER2+ type. The cancer has formed in her lymph nodes as well. Her cancer is aggressive and the cells are about to start multiply and divide. Because of the severity of the cancer  she is having to relocate to Medellin Colombia for immediate treatment. She is however working with a world class team of doctors who are putting her case at the top of their priority. Christie will need extensive treatment that includes chemotherapy  surgery  radiation  and hormone therapy which doctors are saying that it may take up to a year or longer for this treatment. Christie’s Heart Failure Story:                The oncologists in Colombia made it clear to Christie that treatment for her cancer must begin immediately and that she needed to get an echocardiogram as a precautionary before beginning chemotherapy. Upon visiting with a cardiologist  it has been discovered Christie has heart failure. This was caused from the Chagas Disease which is known as a silent killer because it is asymptomatic. This rare disease was caused from a tropical bug that has transmitted an infectious parasite that has deteriorated Christie’s heart. This has created multiple challenges as Christie faces the much needed treatment for her cancer. Oncologists and Cardiologists are working together to form a plan best fit for Christie and her unfortunate situation.  When Christie returns to Colombia to reside permanently which receiving treatment  she will begin the process of attaining her residency and securing health insurance. Because of her aggressive cancer diagnosis  treatment will have to begin before she can get health insurance. All costs to the treatment will have to be made up front. We greatly appreciate any support received  all funds will be going directly to Christie's breast cancer treatment."

He’s a wonderful son  partner  brother  stepdad  and friend. He can’t wait to marry his fiancee Christine. He’s a hard-working and talented carpenter and a gifted chef. He loves live music and travel and a good cup of coffee. And he is always there if you need him. But Josh’s life almost ended on November 25  2018 when he suffered a serious and life-threatening brain bleed. He was rushed to a nearby emergency room and then taken by life flight helicopter to a hospital that specializes in treating serious aneurysms like Josh’s.Josh was one of the lucky ones — he survived. What doctors didn’t tell us at the time was that more than 90% of people in Josh’s situation don’t make it. Doctors also didn’t tell us until later that the small number of people who do survive a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage like Josh’s (the most serious form of aneurysm)  are often in a coma months later. Josh’s experience has been different. He woke up and was able to breathe without life support in just two days.  He made it through a dangerous two weeks when the blood vessels in his brain went into spasms that could have resulted in strokes and his body re-learned to regulate his temperature after daily fevers that threatened his life. Doctors saved Josh with repeated and complicated treatments. Despite the severity of his illness  Josh was walking with the help of a walker – haltingly  with difficulty – within a couple of weeks. He survived in large part because of the excellent medical care he has received. Yet  his recovery has been so unusual that even his doctors and nurses are amazed. They stop by his hospital room just to ask Josh his story. Hospital staff call him the “miracle man.”   The aneurysm left Josh’s body unable to clear fluid from his brain and Josh recently had further surgery to place a permanent shunt to prevent dangerous pressure buildups in his brain. Josh will need lifelong follow-up care with neurologists and other specialists to monitor his health. Josh was in critical condition in the ICU for three weeks. To date  doctors and nurses and air ambulance personnel have provided about $2 million in medical care. Thankfully  health insurance covers a lot of his medical costs  but not all of them. Josh is facing very large medical bills and collections personnel are eager for payment.  It will take hard work and time for Josh to regain his strength. His memory is still fuzzy  he is learning to manage severe headaches that doctors tell us may last weeks or months  and he will need cognitive therapy to sharpen his verbal skills and memory. Doctors can’t say when Josh will be able to go back to work. He will need weeks or months of physical therapy to help him regain function in his left leg and foot. Josh needs your help to complete this miracle. Please consider making a contribution in any amount to support Josh’s efforts in his recovery journey."

The Texas sun sure was a challenge for the big guy  but he found his groove working construction with a long time friend. Unfortunately about 3 months ago  Joe hurt his shoulder and with no health insurance nor funds for medical assistance  he fought thru the pain and proceeded to work a very physical job day in and out. His luck was not great and gained several other injuries mostly impacting his initial injury of his shoulder. As time passed  he became very ill with what hospitals and urgent care stated was the flu. It became unbearable with a 3rd trip to hospital the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving. Again  given antibiotics and pushed along since no medical insurance.  He pushed thru to see friends and family on Thanksgiving. Unknown to all that shared in his presence  that maybe the last time Joe would be seen in his larger than life self. His mother had not heard from him since that day and became concerned. She reached out to his long time friend  Joel  to check on him. To his dismay  he found Joe incoherent on the bedroom floor of his apartment. Luckily for Joe  Joel was able to handle his weight and rushed him to the hospital to later get a spinal tap. Result: bacterial meningitis. He was in very bad shape and no estimates could be given for his survival. He was transferred to a new hospital with an isolated ICU to begin the road to recovery. Here  the hospital also learned that he had a severe infection of the blood and the infection had been pumping thru his body for a length of time.  It was touch and go the 1st week. Luckily  Joe is a big guy and his body was able to handle the stress!! After getting diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes as well  the doctors/nurses struggled to keep him stable. slowly Joe started to become coherent. Break thru in week 2! Large abscess was found in the shoulder that he injured so many months ago  the size of a baseball that started to solidify. Surgeons went to work ridding his body of the infectious abscess. With a pump  lots of IV antibiotics Joe is coming around. The source of all the illnesses and pain that was plaguing his body was found! He is on a LONG road to recovery! Joe will be in the hospital until all bacteria levels are back to normal in his blood  blood/sugar levels are kept normal and body temperature stable. Doctors have no idea as it is a day by day process with many tests. We hope  for all the doctors/nurses sake that Joe is back at home on the mend as his over the top personality is hard to contain!! Once released he will have to undergo IV antibiotic treatments everyday for 4-6 weeks.as well as starting a new regimen with insulin and diet. IF this was all he is up against  that would be AMAZING!  However  the blood infection pumped thru his whole body affecting his heart and muscles. He is very weak and cannot walk or get up on his own. road to recovery is 3-6 months once final treatments are made. At the end  the hope is that he is back to his vibrant self!! Joe has been trying to stay cheery and be proactive. working with a social worker to hopefully obtain some level of charitable health insurance and possibly disability. The social worker is not optimistic about much aid coming thru. With no health insurance  or savings his family has been helping pay his rent until he can get back on his feet  no pun intended... I am reaching out to all his friends and family that he has spread his contagious laugh and witty personality with to help Joe on his journey from death bed to life! He will need help with medical bills  medications  therapy  and everyday life expenses until we see him on his feet ready to share large hugs with all!"

The prognosis is good  but her initial treatment will include chemotherapy to shrink a very aggressive tumor and then surgery. Many of us have had friends and family members who have battled cancer and we understand the mental and physical toll it takes on daily life. It is so easy to fall behind and be overwhelmed. Although Erica and her husband  Antonio  do not have health insurance  Erica was able to qualify for a special Medi-Cal program for breast cancer treatment. Even so  there have been and there will be unforeseen and uncovered medical and personal expenses. Erica is also anticipating the loss of income while she recuperates from treatment as her current job with a grocery store offers no sick leave benefits. Meanwhile  Antonio is picking up as many shifts as he can working at Universal Studios (working double shifts when available)  but his hours will likely be reduced after the holidays. Plus  Antonio’s work commute to Los Angeles is a long one (1-2 hours depending on traffic) and he wants to be with Erica as much as possible during her treatment.‘Tis the season when we all have many obligations and distractions  but please help out if you can. Your generosity will help Erica and Antonio meet their financial obligations during a very difficult period in their lives. Whether you know Erica through Aikido  bicycling  or any other activity  you know that she is strong will eventually be declared the winner of this fight  but she needs us in her corner!If you live in the Ventura area  feel free to reach out to Erica and Antonio in any way you feel comfortable  such as checking in with her when Antonio is working  connecting over coffee or a meal  accompanying her to appointments  or help/support with a ketogenic diet.

She is currently recovering from her surgery while waiting for chemotherapy and radiation treatments to begin. She was hospitalized for two weeks but did not have health insurance and is facing enormous medical bills. Val is a wife  mother of three boys  a friend  and devout follower of Christ. She is the most loving  kind  caring  and selfless person  always putting others before herself. Val and her family have dedicated their lives to serving Jesus  always living according to God’s word. She and her husband left everything behind to move to the United States to serve in a missionary church with their three young children and nothing but two suit cases of clothes. They spoke no English and had to make their way. Her journey has not been easy  but she has always confronted every challenge with determination  a positive attitude  and open heart and mind. Val was experiencing severe abdominal pain and visited an Urgent Care Clinic where they performed blood tests and an ultrasound. The test showed abnormal results but did not indicate any serious issues and she was instructed to see an OB/GYN. After seeing an OB/GYN a few days later  the doctor too confirmed nothing serious and was sent home with more pain medication. It wasn’t until several days later of Val suffering excruciating pain  unrelieved by the pain medication she was given  that she went to the ER. This is where further tests were done and several cancerous masses were found in her abdomen and filling her reproductive organs. Current condition and NEED: Val is preparing to fight for her life while awaiting treatments that cost tens of thousands and up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. She needs the emotional support of her husband  Oscild  who is a long haul truck driver that spends weeks at a time on the road to provide for the family. His income is not enough to cover the massive medical costs of these treatments necessary to save her life. Val is a fighter  and is determined to beat this disease.

This all adds up to the reality that the 12 hours a week that Morgan works often feels overwhelmingly difficult.  It means that she’s often pushing herself to do the things that life asks of all of us  but with levels of pain or fatigue that would keep most of us in bed until it was over.  But  for her  it’s never over. Morgan has remarkable stubbornness and has developed many skills and tools to help herself deal with her daily symptoms. However  living with less pain and fatigue would be  a tremendous relief!In December of 2018  we had a court case to determine whether and how much the auto insurance company of the driver who hit Morgan in 2014 would owe us as a liability payment.  We had great hopes that this settlement would provide us with funds that we could invest in treatments that have a hope of providing relief from the symptoms that Morgan experiences.  However  despite the fact that the driver had clearly broken a number of laws  the jury found the driver to not be negligent  meaning that the insurance company will not pay a settlement. The jury reasoned that because they could imagine themselves running through a crosswalk in the same way the driver who hit Morgan did  it must be ok. Unfortunately  there is no possibility of appeal.As a result of losing to the insurance company  we are helping to raise awareness and change the laws so that this won’t happen to other people. Morgan will be working in coalition with Washington Bike Law and other organizations to advocate for a “presumption of liability” law  which would better protect people who are hit by cars  while also being fair to drivers.However  since changing the law won’t change our circumstances  we are reaching out to our families and communities to make it possible for Morgan to receive treatment.  The treatment facility that Morgan has selected is Cognitive FX    which does week-long intensives for people in exactly Morgan’s situation  i.e. people who have ongoing brain injury symptoms which have not been responsive to other types of treatment.  Morgan has chosen this partly because two people she knows and trusts  who have similarly complex  ongoing  and treatment resistant symptoms as hers  have experienced great improvement and reduction in symptoms through their work with Cognitive FX.Cognitive FX does specialized brain scans (fMRIs or fNCIs) that pinpoint which areas of the brain are receiving too much or too little blood.  This gives the practitioners specific information about what kinds of exercises are needed to create the changes in the brain to help the brain work more efficiently and thus reduce the symptoms While no treatment can promise results  we have chosen Cognitive FX as being the most likely to be able to give Morgan the most relief.Thank you so much for considering helping Morgan access this potentially life-changing treatment.

By the time the ambulance took him to the emergency room he had suffered 3 seizures  each lasting about 5 minutes  and had yet to wake up. After an MRI showed a mass in his frontal lobe  the neurologist determined it a tumor. Fortunately  he has no paralysis or brain damage  and was fairly lucid this morning when he regained consciousness. To our relief  he is acting like the same dad we know and love (despite having been heavily sedated). The tumor will need to be removed  of course  at a time yet to be determined.What he needs help with is the financial burden. This has been  in his words  the hardest year of his life  as he took a risk in becoming self-employed and leaving his prior job  and suffered setback after setback. Through his and his loving wife's hard work and sacrifices  they have been able to keep their house. But obviously  this medical development is both untimely and devastating  made worse by the fact that he has no health insurance coverage. Anyone who knows our dad knows he isn't one to ask for help  but we also know there is no way he can pay the looming medical expenses on his own.

Whether rehearsing lines for a play  visiting a sick friend in the hospital or telling you everything you ever wanted to know about an obscure foreign film  Michael is a giving person. The devotion to his friends  joy in sharing passions for theater  comics and music  and the rare quality of his listening are a gift to all who know him.Now I’m asking you to send some of that generosity back his way. The picture  fully known to only a few  is grim. Michael is in daily physical torment due to chronic pain in his head and jaw. Often unable to find and sustain work  he has gone deeply into debt  emptying his savings and maxing out his credit cards. The search for a cure  or anything to even mitigate his suffering  has been a largely futile exercise in navigating the maddening health care and social welfare bureaucracies. The result has not only been ongoing pain and frustration  but fear and anxiety: not knowing when the pain will end; unsure of whether he can ever return to regular work; thinking of the future as one of crushing debt  limited resources and increasingly diminished physical capacity. At this point  he may not be able to pay rent beyond the end of February.Michael needs you.Michael with friend and fellow actor Ted SchneiderThe BackstoryWhat began four years ago as a minor spasm in his jaw has gotten so bad that Michael never goes a day without intense physical pain. He has bounced from one bad diagnosis and ineffective treatment to another. There are days  even after taking pain meds  when Michael can do little more than lie in bed. His inability to find and maintain work has put an enormous strain on an artist’s budget to handle procedures that fall way outside normal health coverage. And state  federal and local organizations that might have helped have either kept benefits at bay completely or put Michael on waiting lists that last more than a year.Lately  however  there has been a glimmer of hope.Michael just recently heard of a new procedure that stops muscle spasms in the jaw by correcting the bite. He found a well-regarded dentist north of Philadelphia who performs the procedure  one of a handful in the world who do it  and his diagnosis and early treatment finally align well with his strange set of symptoms. The CostsBut non-routine dental surgery is extremely expensive. The costs are entirely uncovered by health insurance and are therefore paid out-of-pocket. And there will be several more visits before Michael is back to normal.That’s where you come in.We’d love to hit the goal of $15 000 to cover the costs of an estimated 4-8 visits plus transportation. Any money raised that isn't needed for the procedures will go towards helping Michael pay off debts and get back on his feet as the treatment allows him to return to more regular work.Self-portrait by Michael AvolioHow You Can HelpIt can be maddening to realize that even in 2019  there is no simple way to ease Michael’s pain. At first  there seemed to be no cure. Now  with relief in sight  there is the awesome task of paying for it. When it comes to employment  Michael is in the proverbial Catch-22: He needs to return to work  but in order for that to happen  he first needs some respite from the pain.He needs your help. No donation is too small. It’ll be worth it to see Michael back to his vital self again. After the first of these treatments  Michael felt happier and more hopeful than he has in several years.Whether or not you can donate yourself  please share a personal note about Michael and a link to this page on social media or in emails. It’s hard to exaggerate the ripple effects your help and kind words might have. There are few gifts more precious than health and peace of mind. Collectively  you’ll be helping restore our friend  relative and colleague back to a full life.Thanks and best wishes Andy BrownsteinNote: Please be aware that GoFundMe takes 5 percent out of each donation.

After receiving strange  incoherent text messages from Mark and then being notified that he hadn't shown up for work on time  his wife headed home and had a family member call for an ambulance to meet her at their house. The paramedics transported Mark to Mountain West Medical Center in Tooele for treatment. After realizing the situation was more emergent than they were equipped to handle  Mark was life-flighted to the University of Utah Hospital. When Mark arrived at the U  he was awake and alert. He was unable to speak but able to communicate using hand gestures  facial expressions  and grunts. After a series of scans  it was discovered that Mark had suffered from a left carotid artery dissection which interrupted blood flow and caused a clot to form inside his brain.  A team of neurosurgeons were able to repair the dissected artery using stents and evacuate the clot  successfully restoring blood flow to his brain. At this point it appeared that Mark may be in the clear and our energy should then be focused on how much rehabilitation he would need. Unfortunately  when blood flow was restored Mark suffered a massive hemorrhage causing damage beyond repair and Mark's short life came to an end on March 9th at 3:50am. We are so incredibly thankful for the team working on the Neuro Critical Care Unit at the University Hospital. The remarkable team of nurses  physicians  and surgeons worked tirelessly to save Mark.  Because Mark did not have health insurance  his wife is now left to deal with the devastating loss of her husband as well an incredible financial burden.  If you are able  please consider donating to help Mariah during this impossible time."

In fact  the family has been told more than once that he is a \"miracle\".  We know the outpouring of love from family and friends and the power of prayer are helping his recovery. Most importantly has been the unwavering strength and support he is receving from the love of his life  Becky.  We know the battle is not over for Larry as he has a long road of recovery. We are asking for continued love and prayers. Our hopes for this campaign is to raise enough money to allow his wife to take off from work the full time allowed through the Family and  Medial Leave Act.  For those of you who are not aware  the act mandates that employers allow the time off to eligbile employees; however  it is an unpaid leave. It will be very important for Larry to have Becky by his side through his recovery. It is also important to decrease any stress he may feel due to loss of income. They are blessed with having health insurance; but  there also will be medical bills to pay before this is all over.  If you feel compelled  we would love you to join G-rums' team.

This has meant that my kidneys have slowly been declining  and I recently reached end stage renal failure  meaning I now require a kidney transplant. We are in the middle of the process of finding a donor  but have found a strong candidate in my sister  Tori. Tori is incredibly gracious and is fully on board with donating. I am so thankful for her and for the many who have offered/tried to become donors for me. I am consistently amazed at the generosity of those around me! We are shooting for a transplant date of this spring  or early summer. Thus  as the date approaches  I am realizing  through the wisdom of others  that I should start taking steps to prepare for transplant  not only mentally and physically  but also financially. At this point  we don’t know exactly how much everything will cost. I have health insurance  and we’re hoping to jump into Medicare also and have that cover some of the extra expenses coming in from the transplant  but we recognize that with the costs of a transplant reaching upwards of $300 000 (and extra expenses for travel  lodging  anti-rejection meds   etc.)  the amount I need to cover could yet be in the tens of thousands.  The number we've set here is thus around 10% of the projected costs (obviously hoping that health insurance and Medicare will cover the rest). Thus  I am asking if you would be willing to partner with me in helping to cover some of these costs. I ask you to do so carefully  recognizing that I only want funds to come in and go towards genuine need  and not just to make this process more comfortable. Thus  I am creating several security checks on this  in order to make sure that happens:1) We have created a separate “for the benefit of” bank account to collect all funds. These kinds of accounts are designed specifically for needs such as this  and it allows us to keep track of and make sure the correct funds given are being used for medical and related expenses. The funds from GoFundMe will be directly wired into that account. You can also donate to that account directly by writing a check to: Anna’s Transplant Benefit. 2) I have asked several people to be accountability partners for us in this process. Thus  they will have access to view the funds going in and out of this account  helping to make sure they are being used wisely and correctly. 3) Since we don’t know how much everything will cost yet  I have picked Congo Impact to receive the possibility of extra funds beyond what is needed. You can check out all that they do here:  https://congoimpact.org/I want you to know that I desire to invite you into a process with me. I don’t want to merely ask for financial assistance  but for your partnership as I step into a challenging journey. Thus  I will be posting a series of videos that further explain my disease  what God has been teaching me through it  introduce you to my donor  etc. I also want you to feel free to ask any questions  ask to meet up for coffee  whatever! Thank you for taking the time to read through all this  and more importantly  for your friendship!With gratitude  Anna Vollema"

They have done great renovation work on numerous residential projects around the area  many for my friends and relatives. But unfortunately  this past October  Wally was diagnosed with Anaplastic Thyroid and Lymph Node cancer in the head & neck area. This news came to us as a sudden surprise  considering he is otherwise healthy and in fine shape.I’m friend Geoff  and I’ve known Wally since elementary school  and he was part of our troupe in the McDowell High School Marching Band  playing trombone. Its been a wonderful thing to have a pal like Wally for decades  but now  he needs our help. The “father & son” construction team has to pause for the foreseeable future as its now Wally’s full-time job to fight through the difficulties of cancer treatment  which thankfully is currently underway at the Cleveland Clinic. And Jonathan’s full-time job is to transport and caretake for his father  who is quite weak and feeling terrible. But as you can imagine  medical deductibles and other related health care out-of-pocket costs  along with normal monthly bills and expenses are worrisome obstacles to recovery without an income stream. Therefore  we ask for your kind generosity to raise enough funds to help with their finances during Wally’s treatment and recovery period  in addition to the significant health care bills that preceded the December 1st initiation of their current health insurance policy. Frankly  finding the resources to make the monthly home mortgage and health insurance payments is very challenging and weighs heavy on their minds. Therefore  to take this worrisome financial “weight” off of Wallace  so he can focus on managing the pain that he is in  and to keep his strength up through several months of radiation and chemotherapy  is our primary goal as we look for support through the GoFundMe network of caring people. (As a footnote  we wish to thank the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC for the initial diagnosis and treatment recommendation in November. Additionally  we appreciate the tremendous care currently given by the Oncology team at the Cleveland Clinic.)How you can help more:In addition to donating to this campaign  please consider sharing it with your friends and family on Facebook  email  Twitter  and text message.

This disabling disease is similar to Parkinson’s and Lou Gehrig's or ALS.  Unfortunately there is not a cure.  Every day is a struggle for her to do the daily tasks that many of us take for granted  due to the constant jerkiness of her limbs. Eventually doctors say she will lose her ability to walk and eat.   Upon the onset of this disease Kelly had to stop working.  She lost her health insurance and can not afford it on her own.  She is currently on disability  but will not qualify for disability insurance for a little over a year.  Anyone who remotely knows me knows its’ extremely hard to ask for help. As  her husband  I continues to work daily  at the age of 76 to provide for her healthcare needs  to make her comfortable.  In addition when I come home I take care of the daily household needs  that she is no longer able to do on her own.  We are grateful to have neighbors and church family who have stepped in to assist us when I have to be out of town for work. This week Kelly went to her neurologist and got great news.  She told her that there was a surgery  in Charlotte  NC  that would minimize the jerkiness of her limbs and help her immensely.  This would bring her back some of the freedom she longs for. This surgery will cost between $25 000 and $30 000.  Her neurologist stressed that doing this ASAP would result in the best outcome for her.  If she has to wait another year and a half for her disability insurance  it may be too late.  We are asking from the bottom of our hearts that if GOD leads you to help us make this surgery happen  please consider donating  to our cause.  Any amount will be GREATLY appreciated by our family.  God Bless!Larry Viner"

He had one symptom that prompted him to get screened. We had good news on 11/28  that surgery wasn’t indicated at this time. The plan is to start chemo on 12/10 and let the cocktail do it’s job. However  also on 11/28  we found out that Steve does not have any kind of disability insurance. We are completely losing his income  which accounts for about 2/3 of our household income. We also found out that we will be responsible for his health insurance premiums while he is out of work. This is the reason I’m starting this Go Fund Me. There are many resources out there for cancer patients  but I want to try to utilize all our options. The love and support we’ve received from friends and family in the last 11 days has been overwhelming and I couldn’t be more grateful. If you have the means and can find it in your heart to send us a financial gift  it will just be one more thing we are thankful for."

He was on a ventilator and medically induced coma for weeks. Though he can breathe on his own now  he's still having difficulty using one side of his body  swallowing  and speaking. He has a PEG tube into his stomach for feedings  and is completely dependent on other people caring for him. All prognoses were that he would die  but yet he's fought to stay here. I believe this is for me  our young son Umair who is only 6 years old  and his family.We are now in a dire situation.  No rehabilitation center will accept him as he has no way of paying for medical care or health insurance  and Medicaid will take up to 30-60 days to kick in  if it does. Our apartment lease is up soon in February  and no one is willing to give me an apartment as I have no job nor income. I've had to quit my job at starbucks to be Roushan's caretaker full time. Though our family and extended family is trying their best to help us  we can't manage the thousands in medical bills  housing  and long term care we're facing.

My name is Dan Cottrell  and I wish I was introducing myself for a happier reason. We all are bound together because we know a very special person. Michael Jerryson. Our brother  mentor  teacher  colleuge  co-conspirator  and friend. Michael was recently diagnosed with a genetic version of ALS-  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS is a disease in which you begin to lose control of the muscles in your body. Eventually  you are unable to swallow water - and breathe for yourself. In addition to this physical problem  20-30% of the victims suffer from forms of dementia. Since Michael has the C9orf72 genetic form of ALS  he has an over 70% chance of developing cognitive impairments. The rate of physical decline will be aggressive. Time frames range from 20+ years to less than a year; it is hard to chart.While Michael does have health insurance  he and his family have accrued significant medical expenses since his diagnosis. There have been tests too numerous to mention  and lots of hospital visits. Prescription medications  missed work for both Michael and Fawn  and endless trips to the Cleveland clinic. Michael’s future holds more of the same  and as we all know  there are co-pays  deductibles  services  and endless other fees that slip through the loose net of health insurance. While Michael is still working  and Youngstown State is supporting him incredibly well  it is likely that expenses will continue to mount.I met Michael (he was Mike back then)  way back in 1989  when we shared a Sophomore English class in high school. I knew even then that Mike was an exceptional (and unique) person. Like all of you I’m guessing  I’m inspired regularly by Michael’s loyalty  intelligence  humor  and idealism  not to mention the infectious laugh and smile. For nearly three decades Michael has driven me to be a better person and given me so much as a friend and brother. I can only hope to give Michael a fraction of that back in love  time and support for him and his family during this incredibly challenging time. I am hoping we can raise $20 000 through this campaign to assist Michael and his family. However  I am hoping we can all make an additional donation  perhaps a more valuable one then money. Time. Michael has expressed that one of his most cherished possessions is time spent with the people he loves and cares for. Drop him a note or a text  or even better an old school phone call. Talk to him about the things you share and are passionate about. Laugh about something! Let’s all raise some money  but let’s also raise Michael’s spirits and remind him why we each love and cherish him as much as I know we all do! Love and thanks. Dan"
"Medical","March 2, 2019","Help Support The Friedrich Children","$11,162","$80,000","56","1","56","123","CHICAGO","IL","To all my friends and family.  My friends  Jay and Kristen  have two beautiful children  William and Evelyn  that have some medical issues.  I have known Jay and Kristen for many years  and they both have been wonderful friends.  He is an IT manager and Kristen is a stay at home mom taking care of her special needs children.  They are wonderful parents and good friends. Their childrens' issues have not all been covered by insurance  resulting in over $100 000 in medical bills and debt for their family. The Friedrich family needs support in their time of need. While pregnant with their daughter  Evelyn  they discovered she had Congenital Hydrocephalus and doctors told them she would likely not make it to birth. She proved to be a strong fighter and they got to meet their wonderful baby girl.Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within cavities in the brain called ventricles. It occurs when there is an imbalance between the amount of CSF that is produced and the rate at which it is absorbed. As the CSF builds up  it causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase.Sadly  her struggle was only beginning. By seven months old  she needed to be rushed into emergency pediatric neurosurgery to install a cerebral shunt to relieve the pressure on her brain. She also developed very serious seizures and had to be put on a costly ($2700/month) medicine that  while it could result in permanent damage her eyesight  would bring the seizures under control over the course of several months. Those seizures and the hydrocephalus led to Evelyn developing Quadriplegic Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Hypotonia is diminished muscle tone. Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy is often the result of severe brain damage or malformations and is a physical disability that affects movement and posture and can result in complications such as additional seizures and intellectual delays. In Evelyn's case  it means she has less muscle tone in all of her limbs which affects her ability to walk  grasp  and other tasks that rely on motor control or muscle tone. While all that was going on  their young son  William  had stopped talking  stopped eating  and began experiencing chronic pain in his joints. It took them over a year of medical trial and error: speech therapy  feeding clinics  GI surgery  occupational therapy  and others  along with dozens of different doctors and specialist and some rather large medical bills (in the tens of thousands) to get to a diagnosis. William has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and is on the Autism Spectrum. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin  bones  blood vessels  eyes  and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions  which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications; such as easy bruising and scarring  joint dislocation  rupture in major blood vessels and others. There is no cure for EDS  but it can be treated.Doctors also strongly recommend William begin Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment for his autism and leg braces for his EDS. Evelyn requires leg and hand braces for her Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. Both kids have been fighting throughout all of this  and have done amazingly well with treatment. Better than their parents dared to hope for. They’ve been in and out of hospitals the entirety of their young lives: 5 ER visits  6 times being admitted for long term care  3 CT scans  7 MRI’s  4 long-term EEG studies  and 9 series of X-Rays just for baby Evelyn before she was even 18 months old  and William has been to the ER multiple times for dislocations and other issues related to his EDS. Within the near future  Evelyn will also need to undergo another brain surgery for a shunt revision  as she outgrows her current shunt or it fails (they almost always do  sooner or later). After William was diagnosed with Autism they discovered their health insurance would not cover any of his treatment related to his autism  leaving them to pay tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills completely out of pocket.William and Evelyn require treatment several times a week with occupational therapy  speech therapy  and physical therapy. Their mother  Kristen has had to put off returning to work indefinitely to care for their children  as they couldn’t possibly afford to pay for their children’s care if they didn’t take a large portion of it on themselves. They have also had to cease their own healthcare for their own medical issues (they both also have EDS) to keep their medical costs down as much as possible. They are left with a mountain of medical debt and both of their children have a long struggle ahead of them. They need your help! Your donations will be used to help them reduce or pay off their medical debts and get these wonderful and fiercely strong young children access to the treatments and procedures they need to thrive."

My name is Dan Cottrell  and I wish I was introducing myself for a happier reason. We all are bound together because we know a very special person. Michael Jerryson. Our brother  mentor  teacher  colleuge  co-conspirator  and friend. Michael was recently diagnosed with a genetic version of ALS-  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS is a disease in which you begin to lose control of the muscles in your body. Eventually  you are unable to swallow water - and breathe for yourself. In addition to this physical problem  20-30% of the victims suffer from forms of dementia. Since Michael has the C9orf72 genetic form of ALS  he has an over 70% chance of developing cognitive impairments. The rate of physical decline will be aggressive. Time frames range from 20+ years to less than a year; it is hard to chart.While Michael does have health insurance  he and his family have accrued significant medical expenses since his diagnosis. There have been tests too numerous to mention  and lots of hospital visits. Prescription medications  missed work for both Michael and Fawn  and endless trips to the Cleveland clinic. Michael’s future holds more of the same  and as we all know  there are co-pays  deductibles  services  and endless other fees that slip through the loose net of health insurance. While Michael is still working  and Youngstown State is supporting him incredibly well  it is likely that expenses will continue to mount.I met Michael (he was Mike back then)  way back in 1989  when we shared a Sophomore English class in high school. I knew even then that Mike was an exceptional (and unique) person. Like all of you I’m guessing  I’m inspired regularly by Michael’s loyalty  intelligence  humor  and idealism  not to mention the infectious laugh and smile. For nearly three decades Michael has driven me to be a better person and given me so much as a friend and brother. I can only hope to give Michael a fraction of that back in love  time and support for him and his family during this incredibly challenging time. I am hoping we can raise $20 000 through this campaign to assist Michael and his family. However  I am hoping we can all make an additional donation  perhaps a more valuable one then money. Time. Michael has expressed that one of his most cherished possessions is time spent with the people he loves and cares for. Drop him a note or a text  or even better an old school phone call. Talk to him about the things you share and are passionate about. Laugh about something! Let’s all raise some money  but let’s also raise Michael’s spirits and remind him why we each love and cherish him as much as I know we all do! Love and thanks. Dan"

Their childrens' issues have not all been covered by insurance  resulting in over $100 000 in medical bills and debt for their family. The Friedrich family needs support in their time of need. While pregnant with their daughter  Evelyn  they discovered she had Congenital Hydrocephalus and doctors told them she would likely not make it to birth. She proved to be a strong fighter and they got to meet their wonderful baby girl.Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within cavities in the brain called ventricles. It occurs when there is an imbalance between the amount of CSF that is produced and the rate at which it is absorbed. As the CSF builds up  it causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase.Sadly  her struggle was only beginning. By seven months old  she needed to be rushed into emergency pediatric neurosurgery to install a cerebral shunt to relieve the pressure on her brain. She also developed very serious seizures and had to be put on a costly ($2700/month) medicine that  while it could result in permanent damage her eyesight  would bring the seizures under control over the course of several months. Those seizures and the hydrocephalus led to Evelyn developing Quadriplegic Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Hypotonia is diminished muscle tone. Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy is often the result of severe brain damage or malformations and is a physical disability that affects movement and posture and can result in complications such as additional seizures and intellectual delays. In Evelyn's case  it means she has less muscle tone in all of her limbs which affects her ability to walk  grasp  and other tasks that rely on motor control or muscle tone. While all that was going on  their young son  William  had stopped talking  stopped eating  and began experiencing chronic pain in his joints. It took them over a year of medical trial and error: speech therapy  feeding clinics  GI surgery  occupational therapy  and others  along with dozens of different doctors and specialist and some rather large medical bills (in the tens of thousands) to get to a diagnosis. William has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and is on the Autism Spectrum. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin  bones  blood vessels  eyes  and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions  which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications; such as easy bruising and scarring  joint dislocation  rupture in major blood vessels and others. There is no cure for EDS  but it can be treated.Doctors also strongly recommend William begin Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment for his autism and leg braces for his EDS. Evelyn requires leg and hand braces for her Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. Both kids have been fighting throughout all of this  and have done amazingly well with treatment. Better than their parents dared to hope for. They’ve been in and out of hospitals the entirety of their young lives: 5 ER visits  6 times being admitted for long term care  3 CT scans  7 MRI’s  4 long-term EEG studies  and 9 series of X-Rays just for baby Evelyn before she was even 18 months old  and William has been to the ER multiple times for dislocations and other issues related to his EDS. Within the near future  Evelyn will also need to undergo another brain surgery for a shunt revision  as she outgrows her current shunt or it fails (they almost always do  sooner or later). After William was diagnosed with Autism they discovered their health insurance would not cover any of his treatment related to his autism  leaving them to pay tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills completely out of pocket.William and Evelyn require treatment several times a week with occupational therapy  speech therapy  and physical therapy. Their mother  Kristen has had to put off returning to work indefinitely to care for their children  as they couldn’t possibly afford to pay for their children’s care if they didn’t take a large portion of it on themselves. They have also had to cease their own healthcare for their own medical issues (they both also have EDS) to keep their medical costs down as much as possible. They are left with a mountain of medical debt and both of their children have a long struggle ahead of them. They need your help! Your donations will be used to help them reduce or pay off their medical debts and get these wonderful and fiercely strong young children access to the treatments and procedures they need to thrive."

It is listed under the National Organization of Rare Diseases and around 10-15 new cases out of a million are diagnosed each year.Most patients don't \"look sick\" but depending on the severity at diagnosis  life expectancy without successful treatment to slow progression is 3-5 years.Diagnosed in December of 2016  Genevieve is currently being treated but the disease is progressing and she is now being referred to the Duke Medical Center in Durham  NC for transplant.Having \"Idiopathic\" pulmonary arterial hypertension makes it a Class I form of the disease and very difficult to treat due to its unknown cause. The current treatment requires medications that need to be shipped from a specialty pharmacy. Patients are instructed by specialty trained nurses on how to administer and monitor IV meds and medication dosing.These medications are extremely sensitive and can be life-threatening if interrupted. Monthly co-pays can run anywhere from $400-$690.00 not to include frequent hospitalizations  therapies and doctor visits.For a family of 6  preparing to have to finance such an undertaking of relocating to another state  maintain the home and family in VA (to include two younger children) is both an emotional and financial hardship.The estimated cost for this procedure (barring any complications) is well over $2.5 million dollars. Even with quality health insurance  this is just an estimate and does not reflect the costs for additional pulmonary and physical therapies  immunosuppressant drugs and repeated trips to Durham for follow up when discharged.Financial guidance provided by the Duke Medical Center recommends that patients come prepared with at least $10 000 to assist with the cost of relocating to Durham  North Carolina  and living expenses (for both patient and their caregiver(s) during the time that they are required to reside at Duke and for 6 months to a year following transplant.Typically  the wait for a donor organ could be as soon as 15 days (for 1 organ) or 1 - 2 years depending upon tissue and blood match and availability of organs. Costs incurred are for room and board  prescriptions  transportation  and basic living essentials.Once the initial evaluation is completed  and a patient is accepted into the program  they may be expected to relocate immediately or within 3-6 months.For those of you who wish to journey with Genevieve and her family while they prepare for a lifesaving surgery  we will provide a link to her Caring Bridge Medical Journal upon receipt of any donation.If you can find it in your hear to support “Team Genevieve” by making a donation and then sharing with your network we would be forever so grateful.

She would eat some crackers or a few bites of a sandwich  then she'd start feeling full. She started losing weight and was fatigued  but she still kept babysitting her grandbaby whenever she was needed  and spent many of her weekends driving to Bryan  three hours away  to spend time with her widowed mother. All the while  she was feeling ill  but like a mama bear  our Mom is reluctant to let on when she's unwell. Finally  in August 2018  even Mom's iron will started to fade  and she began seeking treatment. For months  doctors prodded her. They ordered invasive and expensive tests  but couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally  the Friday before Thanksgiving  she went to the emergency room in excruciating pain. The doctors performed a laparoscopy  and when she awoke from the anesthesia  they told her the news no one wants to hear: \"It's cancer  and it's everywhere.\"Maribelle has a very rare form of cancer that strikes only one in a million: mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix. In a cruel twist  she had her appendix removed in 2007  which means this cancer has been growing in her abdomen  undetected  for 11 years. Hundreds of  tumors now encase most of the organs in her belly—her large intestine  gallbladder  spleen  liver and perhaps more.(Images from Maribelle's laparoscopy)Fifteen years ago  this diagnosis would have been a death sentence. This cancer  which is part of a group of cancers called peritoneal cancer  does not typically respond to traditional chemotherapy. But in the early 2000s  a new treatment called Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy  or HIPEC  began extending the lives of patients by as much as 10+ years.HIPEC will be one of the biggest trials of Maribelle's life. The surgery itself can last up to 16 hours  as surgeons remove any expendable organs and painstakingly excise tumors from what remains  then bathe the abdominal cavity in heated  high-intensity chemotherapy drugs for two hours. When the surgery is over  Maribelle will spend several days in the ICU  stay in the hospital for at least two weeks  and will be out of work for several more as her body recovers. The scar will run the length of her abdomen  from her sternum to her pelvis  and it may be six months to a year before she's fully recovered.Learn more about HIPEC here Maribelle has weathered a lot in her life. As a single working mom  she singlehandedly raised two children and two stepchildren. (That’s one mom and FOUR kids!) During the recession of 2008  she was unexpectedly laid off from her employer of 20+ years  and she went back to school to create a new career for herself in her 50s. Now  Maribelle is too young for Medicare but finds herself facing a daunting medical emergency. Although she has a good job and health insurance  she will be taking a great deal of unpaid time off  and she’ll be  reaching her maximum out-of-pocket limit twice  once for treatment in 2018 and again for 2019.  Your donations will go directly to her hospital fees and other necessary expenses.Fortunately  Maribelle has three things on her side:(Dr Patricio Polanco)1) A great surgical team. We're fortunate to be working with Dr Polanco at UT Southwestern. He is an experienced provider of HIPEC  and we are confident he and his team will give Maribelle the best care in Texas.(Maribelle and grandson Tom)2) A great attitude. If you've met Maribelle  you know she is 100% a  steel magnolia. She's loving and warm  but also highly determined. She  would do anything for her family.  She has four young grandchildren and another due this spring  and Maribelle is not going to let anything get in the way of playing with her precious grandbabies.3) Loving friends and family. Maribelle comes from a family that's as tight-knit as they come  and is surrounded by friends and a church community who are ready to help her through this difficult time. We are already planning to spend weeks of our own time off—paid and unpaid—helping Mom as she heals. She will initially need assistance with all the small tasks of everyday life—dressing  bathing  etc—and will require a special diet for many months. For this reason  she won't be needing meals  but if you'd like to find another way to help her  please send us a message. It's likely she will be needing help with driving  errands  lifting and other tasks for months after the surgery. Thank you again for your help. Together we can get through this difficult moment and help the woman who's given so much  so lovingly  to so many."

In December 2018  she was diagnosed with Stage 2 metastatic breast cancer. In January 2019  Sara had a mastectomy and several lymph nodes removed. Due to the discovery of additional cancer  she underwent a second surgery four weeks later to remove 20 more lymph nodes. In February  her cancer was reclassified as Stage 3. She is currently undergoing three months of chemotherapy after which she’ll begin five to six weeks of daily radiation treatments. Hormone therapy will become a part of her life for the next five to ten years after that. About SaraSara lives in Rochester  NY  and is employed as the Senior Director of Programs at a local museum. She is a single mother of two awesome children – Dylan  who is on his own  living nearby in Penfield  and Lydia  who lives at home  works at a cafe  and is finishing her freshman year at Monroe Community College. Sara always strives to maintain a positive attitude about life. Knowing her strength and determination  I am confident she will surmount both the significant physical and emotional challenges that lie ahead – especially with the help and support of her team of doctors  family members  and friends. Financial challenges for Sara also lie ahead. She has health insurance through her employer  but the plan’s very high deductible and ongoing uncovered medical bills for this year will require at least $7 000. The much bigger financial challenge for Sara will be due to the loss of income. Since her diagnosis  she has been able to use paid sick leave and paid vacation days to get through the recent surgeries. Her chemotherapy and radiation treatments  as well as recovery from these treatments  will require a much greater amount of time. Sara will be required to take three to four months of unpaid time off work  resulting in a loss of income – income needed to pay rent  pay monthly bills  support her daughter  and cover day-to-day expenses. These financial burdens will be a source of ongoing stress during this time of already overwhelming anxiety. How can we help Sara?The doctors and specialists are helping Sara from the medical aspect. Family members  friends  and support agencies are providing Sara the needed emotional support. What is left is tackling the financial challenges during her treatment  which will  in turn  help prevent the anxiety that goes with them.If Sara is free of stress related to income loss and uncovered medical expenses  she will be able to focus her energies on healing  maintaining a positive spirit  and taking the best care of herself that she can – something that could prove critical for her recovery.

My name is Allison and my sister  Cara  and I are writing this for our mom  Beth  who is undergoing a thoracic aortic replacement surgery with limited health insurance and no disability coverage through her job. This is a critical  life saving open-heart surgery that will require all of her strength to be focused on her long road to recovery. As a result  she is struggling to find peace because she is unable to cover all the expenses related to this surgery due to her circumstances. My mom and I have Marfan Syndrome  a genetic disease that weakens the connective tissue  which happens to be the glue that holds the body together. This condition makes my mom vulnerable to connective tissue tears  or dissections  which is how we ended up here. 20 years ago  my mom had her first aortic replacement surgery on her ascending aorta which was successful. We hoped that that was the only open-heart surgery she would need in her lifetime. We had a scare 10 years ago when she experienced her first aortic dissection. I’ll never forget the day I woke up and walked into my mom’s room to find her sitting on the end of her bed clutching her chest  unable to breathe. Cara helped me back to my room and told me to stay there until she said everything was ok. I was 12  and I couldn’t stop thinking that this might be the last time I ever saw my mom. All I could think in that moment was that my grandmother  my mom’s mom who also had Marfan Syndrome  and had passed away from an aortic dissection when my mom was only 10  not much younger than I was at the time. It was terrifying. Fortunately  my mom knew she had Marfan’s and was able to be an advocate for herself in the hospital. After telling my mom she was simply having back pain and making her wait in the emergency room for hours untreated  she essentially educated the doctors on her condition and convinced them she was having a dissection and to get her the correct treatment right away.In 2008 when the market crashed my mom lost her job  at which point she decided to go back to school to become a nurse. She wanted to help people heal in the same way her nurses had helped her. My mom has ALWAYS put others first  often forsaking her own health or happiness to make sure others are taken care of. As a nurse  she works with geriatric patients during the day while also picking up shifts at a hospital working with patients recovering from substance abuse. My mom has so much love to give  she is a gentle and kind spirit who wants nothing more than to help others and see them happy. She’s helped so many people  and now it’s our turn to help her. My parents divorced when I was 10 and I so admire my mom for raising two daughters while keeping our lives as close to normal as possible. However  my mother has been accumulating medical bills for her and myself as there are a limited number of doctors specializing in Marfan Syndrome.Fortunately  we’ve found one of the best surgeons to do our mom's surgery  but this quality of care comes with a very high cost. My mom is also concerned about termination at her job because she is not eligible for FMLA protection having been there for less than a year. We are asking for help to pay for my mom’s surgery  medical bills from the hospital  and general everyday things while she is out of work and will not be earning any income. My mom already works 2 jobs to pay her bills — and with this lack of income  I’m afraid she will push herself to go back to work before she’s fully healed. Our greatest wish is that we can help alleviate some of the financial burden we know she is facing. We would like to see her go through her recovery without the added stress of wondering how she will be able to pay for the basics like food and shelter. We ask you to please help if you can  we greatly appreciate anythingyou may be able to give at this time  and we would also greatly appreciate you helping to share our mom’s story. This is major surgery and it is terrifying for me and my sister. We are trying to help my mom in any way we know how  and we would be incredibly appreciative of any help you can give."

She is a wonderful and caring mother to her 5 year old son and a loving wife. Well  this time Nevena needs our help  our support and generosity. She needs us in the hardest of times  as she is battling breast cancer. Nevena was diagnosed with triple-negative  pretty invasive and fast developing breast cancer and had to start treatments immediately after her diagnosis  during a time when she had NO health insurance coverage. This diagnosis came at the worst of times  right before the holidays. Needless to say  the cost of treatments  scans  test and medications are in the thousands by now (over $20 000 at this time) and are all out of pocket expense. And this is just the beginning. She needs to go through 5 more rounds of chemo  followed by a surgery and possibly radiation. It has become quite overwhelming for her and her family and the bills just keep coming in. Please consider any donation amount  so we can help Nevena and ease her worries  because the last thing someone needs during their fight with cancer is worrying about medical bills.  I know she has touched the hearts of many people over the years and I hope everyone finds it in their hearts to give back.

They are exemplary  hard-working  God-loving people  the likes of which we should all strive to emulate. Unfortunately in this world  disease does not discriminate  nor does it care what kind of remarkable life we lead.  We are left to struggle the best we can while still caring for our family.   Marcia faces a dire health challenge  but she and her family hold out hope for a life-saving diagnosis and treatment. A small sacrifice from us can keep their hopes alive.Marcia was an avid athlete who enjoyed running  cycling  hiking  and thrived on fitness. As a physical therapist  she healed others who were suffering from pain. In the last nine months she has suffered from a puzzling condition that has caused chest and abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  inability to eat and overwhelming fatigue. Multiple visits to physicians at Scripps and UCSD and dozens of tests have shed no light on the cause. Marcia has lost weight (down to 76 lbs!) and is losing strength daily. She can no longer work or care for her young children. Because of their reduced income  her teenage daughter will work to help pay the family household expenses. Their next (and maybe last) option is the Mayo Clinic  which is not covered under their health insurance. We need your prayers  your ideas for a diagnosis  and we need financial assistance to help medical experts find life-saving answers. Any amount would be a tremendous help to a wonderful family trying to live through devastating circumstances.  We're not social media experts so if you can also help spread the word to your circle of family and friends through sharing on Facebook or Twitter  please click on those logos below.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts and God Bless you.Andy and Rusty's Thursday morning Cursillo brothers."

Now it is stage 4 and was told her life would be drastically cut short. After 2 months of being on a trial drug  it became apparent this was not the quality of life she wants to have. Immunotherapy is the next option which is  unfortunately not covered under health insurance. Joann is someone with a big heart and always willing to help others. She has a strong work ethic. After working at the Santa Rosa Junior College for 26 years  she is well loved by the students  faculty and staff members. In December 2018 she will officially be retired. JoAnn is a devoted mother of 4 and grandmother of 5. Being a single parent raising 4 kids on her own  she taught us the value of family and the importance of being there for each other. The rock of our family  she is always positive  supportive and encouraging.  She never complains even in the most difficult or painful of times. As one of Jehovah's Witnesses she relies on her faith to keep her strong.Many people have inquired how they can help financially so  we have decided to put up a go fund me account to help with her treatments and quality of life.

One to remove broken discs and then another to do corrective surgery  after a car accident he was in damaged the previous surgical area . The current situation is that these discs pressed and pinched on Larry's spinal root nerves for too long a time and now these nerves are damaged and slowly deteriorating. Without treatment  Larry could lose his ability to do normal everyday functions and even his ability to walk eventually. Larry is a gifted pianist and composer. Without treatment  he would lose the ability to play the piano or any musical instrument  which is his lifelong work and livelihood. The treatment for his nerve damage involves a relatively new approach called Stem Cell Therapy.  Stem cell therapy for nerve damage is surprisingly straightforward. Stem cells are collected from your own blood  bone marrow  or from your fat tissue. Once the stem cells are recovered  they are then injected into specific locations where they adapt to heal damaged tissue. Results may not show immediately  but once the cells get to work  the healing process begins. Stem cells are key to unlocking your body’s ability to heal itself. Broadly speaking  adult stem cells are what is known as undifferentiated (meaning that they are not permanently locked into a specific kind of cell)  and can become other kinds of cellular tissue that can be used to repair damaged or diseased areas  such as damaged nerves  as needed.How is this possible? You can think of adult stem cells as living  universal building blocks. As such  they can be activated  multiplying into many other kinds of cells  including nerve cells. This means that tissue may be able to regenerate  and heal in ways once thought to be impossible. The longer Larry waits for this treatment  the worse his condition will get and lessen his chances for full healing.Larry's health insurance is bare minimal and does not cover this kind of treatment. He is experiencing great pain and suffering 24/7. These treatments are crucial for Larry in order to relieve the disabling pain that is spreading throughout his body and to restore his life and his music back to him! Many of you already know  Larry and his beautiful music. For those of you who don't  here is a video of his work to help you get a feel for Larry and his heart."

The whole process was a bit scary for all involved but whenever Kristy and I needed some encouragement all we had to do was turn to William who throughout the whole process was amazingly strong! Truly a SUPERHERO! The journey is not over as now we work with the oncology TEAM at Children's to decide on the next course of action. High Grade Gliomas are the most aggressive and difficult forms of cancer to treat but we have options (both FDA approved and Trials) and we will be praying that WE WILL BEAT THIS!  The final week of radiation is upon us and William has been a Superhero throughout!. Well actually we don't end until April 15th but who's counting. Spent the weekend hunting Golden Rainbow trout in WV but only came away with one GIANT Rainbow. Good catch. Followed this up with some NCAA basketball but even though MSU didn't come away with a win it was a great season. Ending the weekend with a brunch hosted by buds from #letmerun. Thanks Alfonso! and some more fishing of course!Thanks to all those who have supported us in so many ways. Jerry and Kristy. I (Deb Levy) have added Gerald (Jerry) Hovis as the beneficiary of this campaign. As you all know  Jerry is the father of William Hovis who is undergoing treatments for brain cancer.  This note is a transparency requirement of the GoFundMe Organization. Thanks.As many of you know  William Hovis had a brain tumor removed on Jan. 29  2019  and he is now undergoing six weeks of radiation treatment and will most likely be followed by chemotherapy. Even with Kristy and Jerry's health insurance  they are sure to incur significant out of pocket costs. This is going to be a long battle. Any support that loved ones can give will help William get the proper care he needs to heal. If you've met William you are really lucky  if you haven't yet met him you will love him when you do!

Make your donation  and complete the order form below. -------------------------------------- While most people were getting ready for Thanksgiving and for Christmas this year  Nikolaos “Nikos” Safos who is 40 years young  found himself in the emergency room at the Hampton Veteran’s Affairs.  After a long 2 days of poking and prodding  the tests confirmed colorectal cancer  a diagnosis usually reserved for much older patients.   For Nikos and his family this news was absolutely devastating.  He has been married for 5 years to Jena  and they have 3 children (1yo  3yo  and a 10yo). Nikos has spent over twenty years serving others and the last almost 3 years  working as a hospice chaplain helping others.  Nikos is a wonderful provider  giver and servant to our community.  Please join us on this journey to fight against cancer! How It Began…In the early part of summer  Nikos didn’t quite feel like his normal self  something just wasn’t quite right  he could sense it. However  he didn’t have health insurance to go get his symptoms checkout. In July Nikos was digging a 4 foot hole in his backyard  but he was having a very difficult time at this task. His heart was racing  he was sweating profusely  and it just seemed like this hole was never going to get dug. As the summer went on  he became weaker and weaker. Several times during the summer and fall  he saw blood in his stool  his appetite decreased  he was a tad grumpy  he had to pull over while driving around time to nap  and he wasn’t sleeping. His wife  Jena  was worried  so she applied for Medicaid  it was denied. Then in October Jena received an email from the VA  stating that any veteran could apply for VA Healthcare. That very day  she applied for health benefits for Nikos. It was about 4 weeks later  they found out Nikos finally had healthcare coverage.  Two weeks before Christmas  Nikos was very pale  could barely walk a few steps without his heart feeling like it was going to explode  could not go up a flight of stairs  and was always short of breath. His wife asked him to go to the ER  just in case he was having a heart attack. He got to the ER  they sent him straight back to run the EKG and the Stress Test  both came back negative. About an hour after being there  the blood work came back  his hemoglobin was a 4 out of 15 and his iron levels were below a 1. There was a leak; somewhere in his body was a leak! Finally we have some answers.  The next step now  was to find the leak. Turns out  no leak…after 4 blood transfusions  2 iron transfusions  and 4 days in the hospital being poked  scanned  analyzed and prodded  the doctors confirmed that Nikos has Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer that has metastasize to the right lobe of his liver  and into his colon lymph nodes.  Nikos has recieved 1 cycle of Avastin and Eloxatin intravenously  and takes Xeloda orally every day  this regiment will continue for a 6-week period. After this period  he will go back out to the VA for a follow up PET scan. The results of this scan; will indicate how they should move forward in the treatment plan.  Funds raised through this campaign will be used for: Medical expensesSuper Fighting Cancer FoodsTravel to Drug TrialsLost wages from being sick T-shirt Order Form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqEAisedE3zt0r0Q2ldiceM1RAQMgyAjHCE7kUbfNYwZ6U5g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1"

We thankfully have everything under one roof including agenda  doctor and treatment coordination.  We had two options given to us and we chose to go with daily radiation and weekly chemotherapy.  She also has a GTube for her food  which feeds and hydrates her directly into her stomach for nourishment. As a Western Regional Business Development Manager  my US territory spans from Mississippi to Hawaii. Most of my work involves travel across multiple States.  Marijke was let go at the end of November 2018 and at present I’m the sole income provider for the family. We fortunately have health insurance for both of us through my company.  If you aren’t from the US  one of the interesting things about health insurance in the US is the insurance picks up about 70% of the costs while the rest is out of pocket.  After two months of treatment  we have maxed our yearly deductible  and our initial personal invoices are due soon! My mom thankfully was able to fly in from Europe in February. With her help we’ve been able to coordinate daily schedules between my mom  Axel ( our son) and myself when local and available. Her 6-week stay is about to come to an end  and we face some new needs. At present we are in search of a care giver (preferably a great looking guy  Marijke’s request) to help with daily liquid feedings  washing  cleaning and cooking tasks.  As well  this person will take Marijke’s to her daily doctor visits.  Unfortunately  this type of help falls outside the realms of what health insurance will cover.  We are looking to raise $15000+ to help pay for these unexpected needs. You are receiving this note as you have been a part of our story. We are so thankful for the role you have played in our lives up to this point.  We truly appreciate all of your prayers and any way you are able to help us during Marijke’s difficult time.  As well  Marijke and I would love to hear from you.  The best way to connect  with Marijke Adam (Yes  Europeans keep their last name even when married) is via messenger   facebook or Text.You are always welcome to visit her personally  actually she seems to flourish seeing friends. Please donate & share  Thank You ALL!P.S.

"Medical","October 23, 2018","Dr. Todd Nelson&apos;s Cancer Fund","$10,481","$12,000","57","5","54","222","LOUISVILLE","CO","I grew up eating brussels sprouts and carob  taking vitamins and homeopathics when I got sick. As an adult  I find myself checking the ingredients on everything before I buy it  shoving vitamins and green leafy vegetables down my son's throat  and loading up on Chinese herbs before winter. One of the most deep-rooted values instilled in my being is Health - and I have my dad  a Naturopath  to thank for that. My father is a healer through and through. He has spent his adult life caring for others  healing others  coaching others  and spreading optimism. He is always available to help people with their questions and ailments  always researching the newest health trends and technologies. He is the healthiest person I know. Unfortunately genetics are powerful  and they had other plans for him.  This has been the most difficult year for him health-wise  especially with this new curve ball the universe has thrown at us. Todd  was diagnosed with HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma cancer in his left tonsil in early October. The tumor is 4 cm and has caused an ulceration making it hard to eat and talk for very long. I never EVER thought I would say \"cancer\" and my dad's name in the same sentence  but here we are and my dad is persevering  with grace  patience  and integrity. The good news is  there is a high success rate for beating this type of cancer with radiation treatment! This entails 33 daily treatments  in a row  which will require my dad to be home from work for 4 weeks.  We can expect severe fatigue  throat pain  radiation site pain  and the likelihood of a feeding tube. The doctor told us that keeping weight on will be a big goal and Todd will likely need to undergo speech therapy as the vocal chords will be affected. The radiation treatment will cost around $8-9 000 out-of-pocket before insurance fully kicks in. He already pays $8  760 in premiums even before paying the deductible  not to mention it all starts over in January. Don't get me started on health insurance in this country!! In conjunction  my dad will also be doing alternative therapies/supports and supplements to compliment the radiation therapy. The estimated cost of these therapies is $1 000- 1500 a month for at least 6 months.As many of you know  my dad is already living with 2 genetic illnesses that are slowly progressive and have rendered him partially disabled. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and a form of neuropathy called Charco-Marie-Tooth 2 (CMT-2). Here’s a link describing each illness:  https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/    https://www.cmtausa.org/understanding-cmt/what-is-cmt/Everything Todd is dealing with has made it very difficult  and at times impossible  to continue to market his practice and because of that his business has been significantly slower. So please consider donating what you can and pass this link (and the word) along to friends and family!"

She has a heart of gold  never judges anyone  and is always the first in line when someone needs help. She has become a sister to me over the years and it is so hard to watch what she has gone through and is going through while being a young mother  during a time which is supposed to be the best years of your life. Katja never asks for help and is a very private person. I did ask her for permission or better lovingly forced her to give me permission to do this for her. Please consider giving whatever you can.

If you can  help before January 2019!!Our dear Maggie (Mona) Hall has been dealing with colon cancer for over 3 years now. It has not been easy by any means  but she has kept working  her personal strength is stunning. The day after Thanksgiving she found out the cancer had become Chemo resistant  and the tumor has grown back to the size it was at diagnosis. She is now on leave from work and she & Nick will be moving into an apartment in our (her parents’) building ASAP. That unit becomes vacant Dec 26th. The timing is horrible I know. Here is why we are asking for your help: 1) Movers run about $2000 - Maggie & Nick’s current apartment is on the third floor with no elevator  there is no way to do it without professionals given the volume of stuff they have. We need to be out of that apartment by Jan 1st. Packing help is wanted too! 2) Budgeting $1000 for a second opinion consult with Dr. Lentz at USC  one of the leading doctors in the world for colorectal cancer  plus any tests he needs to run. Because Maggie has Kaiser insurance and Dr. Lentz is non-Kaiser  it needs to be paid out of pocket. We are hoping future treatment there will be covered by Kaiser but that's iffy. 3) Rental on a storage unit for 6 months  $1000. Since they will be downsizing from a 2-bedroom to a one-bedroom  they’ll need to store their extra stuff; this will be about $160 per month for at least 6 months while we find new homes for some very cool stuff. and 4) Other annoying expenses like health insurance (HAH!)  may be asked for in the future as a tier 2 request  but right now we need $4000 minimum to get things started.So  anyway the main thing is: Maggie needs more support than we can swing right now. If you have the ability to help out either with physical labor packing things up or with donations to help make this move & immediate medical care affordable  we would all be so appreciative.  Maggie is our treasure & she probably is special to you as well. We hate asking for help like this   but time is short & this is vital stuff. Please help if you can.

Through it all  she's remained positive  loving  an incredible mom  and one of the strongest people any of us know. She rarely asks for help (and doesn't even want to ask for it now)  but now is the time she needs her friends and family to help her most. Recently  Harper found a lump in her breast. This resulted in a a bi-lateral lumpectomy surgery  and she was diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast Cancer. Her next course of action is 6 weeks of radiation. She's feeling very positive  but still has a long road ahead.Unfortunately  most of the tests and labs were done before her new health insurance kicked in. Which has resulted in a pretty big hospital tab. Additionally  her new insurance does not cover her entire surgery/radiation and will need to pay a decent amount out of pocket. And she'll need to start making these payments soon. Helping Harper will assist her in paying her hospital bills  but also child care. She's still new to Philly and doesn't have the same network she had in Charleston (yet)  so she'll need childcare/extra helping hands while she's recovering and going through treatment. I know most of us wish we could figure out a way to help her through this. Right now  this is one of the best ways to help her. It will truly help ease her stress about money  bills  childcare and get back to a sense of normalcy for her and Ever. Update: It says this campaign benefits Mary Poe. Harper's first name is \"Mary\"  just in case you didn't know aka it's going to the right person."

"Medical","February 23, 2019","Prayers for Pete","$9,833","$25,000","111","1","111","450","SEVERNAPARK","MD","While getting this fundraiser started for Pete I asked him to give me a little autobiography about the journey he has been on so far. Quickly  I realized being the modest guy he is  I was going to have to tell it from my perspective to ensure everyone knew what really was going on here.     I have grown extremely close with Pete over the past year  close enough to consider him a brother. As we always gain joy by seeing our family members and loved ones succeed in life  nothing takes away more joy than watching a loved one suffer. This past year I have watched Pete’s health and well being deteriorate dramatically and his suffering grow exponentially. Pete is one of the strongest people I have ever met in my life and I truly  without a doubt believe that if anyone else were in his shoes  they wouldn't be alive today.    Throughout his life  Pete has dealt with many health complications ranging from odd symptoms to many bizarre surgeries. It wasn't until 7 years ago that it started becoming debilitating to his lifestyle. He contracted mono in the spring of his senior year of high school  which is common for most  but it was just the beginning of something much worse. He started becoming sick more frequently and severely as the months went on until he was hospitalized that fall during his freshman season of college soccer which caused him to miss most of his season.   Over the next 3 years  he suffered many more bouts of sickness and chronic symptoms but always seemed to recover enough to try to live a normal life. It was not until January 2016 where he became extremely ill. This caused him to miss several weeks of college classes and soccer games on multiple occasions over the next two years. Struggling to keep his grades up and play a college sport  he sought out some of the best doctors; bouncing around between the best at Johns Hopkins. Even with the care of the experts  his symptoms got worse. He had every test and scan they could think of with no avail. He was eventually diagnosed with an \"unknown autoimmune disease\" and told there was nothing they could do.    Despite being told that there was nothing even Johns Hopkins could do for him  he never gave up. After graduating college  he still strived to become a professional soccer player. After earning a tryout at a professional team in Sweden  his dreams were cut short as this sickness became even worse. He had to turn down the opportunity and with it  his dream of playing professional soccer. He had to stop working and put his life on pause as the illness began to take over.     After spending 6 long weeks bed ridden  he was finally healthy enough to try to begin getting his life together. Our paths crossed when he started working at Rockwell Fitness in January 2018.  We immediately became best friends  bonding over our love of fitness  helping others  and everything adventurous. That spring we began working out together  running mountains together  and trekking through blizzards across snow capped mountains together. We even managed to have the opportunity to compete in a Qualifier for a World Championship Obstacle Course Race. As a justification for the amount of fight in this kid  he broke his leg from a bad fall around mile 13 but still ran another 22 miles and completed another 50 some obstacles to qualify for Worlds. Depressingly enough  he would never have the chance to compete at Worlds.  While we always had the time of our lives on these crazy adventures  there was one thing I slowly started to notice. Pete was fighting an internal battle behind the scenes. He would miss a day here or there and always bounce back  but his health slowly started deteriorating again. It began to slip even further over the following months  being hospitalized several times with no cure available to him.    It is one of the most soul crushing feelings to watch one of the strongest people you know and care about face endless suffering with no end to the madness. As of right now  Pete's autoimmune disease has kept him from working out or exercising for the past 8 months. He has a very restricted diet of just cooked vegetables and fish  as that is all his body can handle. He has had an infection in his hand for over a year and a half that cannot be cured due to his autoimmune disease  which renders him unable to take antibiotics. He can't even fly or travel due to his disease. He is forced to spend most of his time home in bed  only fighting to come in to work for a few hours at a time.   However  there has been a glimpse of hope. Pete was able to make an appointment with one of the most world renowned doctors and patiently waited 3 months to be seen by him. He has given light to what could be causing all of this suffering for Pete. The doctor is sure it is a very severe  strand of lymes disease that is the root cause of all the autoimmune issues. He has drawn out a plan of treatment  but warned Pete that is going to be a very rough 6 months ahead of him  informing him he will most likely not be able to work and will be bed ridden for periods of time. Yet most importantly  he will be cured of all of this.     Although  this promise of a cure brings about more problems as these treatments are very expensive and Pete will be turning 26 in two months and will no longer be on his parents’ health insurance. Not many 26 year olds have the means to go weeks without work either. Pete just as always plans to fight through the misery and keep working as much as he can. Yet this will only draw this suffering out longer. I have already told him its going to be worth it to just take the time off and give this treatment the best shot at curing him. He is one of the most beloved guys I know and I know there are many who have witnessed his suffering and wished they could do something to help him. This is how we can help him. Please donate whatever you can to aid him in the costliness of all these medical bills  insurances  and inability to work over these next few months. We all wish to see him finally rid of all this sickness and have the ability to live without fear of this illness wrecking havoc on all that he loves and cares for any longer."

Cancer wasn't even on my radar at that point-- I was working full time  with kids with behavioral issues and pursuing my Master's degree in Special Education while also planning my future with my boyfriend of 5 years  Nick. My family had just moved to South Carolina and I was finally finding my footing on my own..until I was hit with this diagnosis on November 2nd  2018.  Suddenly  I found myself having to put everything on pause to deal with cancer. I'm unable to work through treatment (lowered immune system and my clients can be aggressive)  leaving me with no income and way more bills than I can stay on top of. Nick and I are no longer able to buy a house that we were working to save for. I'm working hard to finish this semester of graduate school but I'm left worried about how I will pay for next semester or if I should continue at this point at all (but then loan repayments kick in!).My parents have been incredible in helping with everything  but they can only take so much as well. They currently live in South Carolina and have already spent countless hours and dollars traveling back and forth between SC and PA  taking care of me and working to maintain an income and health insurance. They don't want me to feel the extra stress of finances right now to focus on getting better  but I also want nothing more than to take it off of them as well because this is way more than just me in this fight. My doctors at Hershey Medical Center have been absolutely wonderful in setting my treatment plan. As of right now   the cancer is a large mass in my left breast and a has spread to a few lymph nodes. I'm scheduled to receive 16 weeks of chemotherapy  followed by (at least a single) Mastectomy surgery and lymph node surgery  and then radiation after that. It will be at least 6 months until I can return to work if all goes well  and there will be medications I'll need for up to 10 years after I finish treatment and lifelong monitoring to ensure it doesn't recur.  I have completed one chemo treatment so far (7 to go!) and I know that I can do this with my support system.This is by no means going to be an easy journey  but I have seen how incredible my friends and family have been already been and I have no doubt that they will get my family and I through this difficult time: mentally  emotionally  and financially."

The HPV vaccine severely damaged my immune system in 2010. As a result  it unleashed a plethora of illnesses on my body. Sick within 24 hours after the first shot  I never got better. I was diagnosed with Late Stage Lyme Disease  multiple co-infections  and Autonomic Nervous System damage at the end of 2016.  POTS in 2018.  And many other illnesses along the way. Eight long years  I have been fighting with all my energy and resources to heal. I was forced to stop working in early 2017. I got a PICC line (an IV catheter) in my arm that has been so helpful in stabilizing me  but I have a long ways to go and my improvement requires ongoing treatment of many different types. It all costs money. Lots of money. My medical treatment costs range from 4k-8k a month.  ￼￼￼￼I have reached my health insurance out of pocket maximum the last 3 years. As you can see  I use in network services as much as possible  but many of my treatments and my main doctors (who see me for 2-6 hours at a time) are not covered by insurance. For those costs  I used my own money  my savings (over 100k)  to survive these last 2 years. Now I need help.I have patiently waited for Long Term Disability to come through  but it keeps getting DENIED - I feel like they’re playing games with me.  I’m exhausted.  Emotionally  mentally  physically  financially. My medical debt and bills are significantly rising with the new year. I am appealing the LTD decision  this time with the help of a lawyer  but that takes both time and money due to the complexity of my illnesses.  Even when LTD is approved  the monthly amount won’t fully cover my medical expenses.Anything you can offer - a dollar  a share  a shout out - helps. Please share it  even if you cannot donate. And then re-share it next month. Fundraising is an ongoing effort  and this won’t be successful without help from many people getting the word out. I hate being so vulnerable. I used to pride myself on being able to take care of myself. Now I feel exposed and scared. But I also have faith. In you. In my body. In strangers that I will never meet.Honest financials:-I made no money in 2018 aside from a tax refund of some sort.  After a year of holding my job  my job had to let me go.-I live by myself. Living with family/friends is not a good choice due to my current neurological challenges.  They do come over often to take care of me.-I pay $800/mo for COBRA because my health insurance is actually pretty good.  In talking with other ill friends  many actually pay MORE than I do as independents.-My friends and family have been helping me behind the scenes before a gofundme was suggested.-I used to have over 100k in my savings.  It pains me to say  it’s gone.-Before this I had ZERO debt (I paid off my student loans and car early. I have or HAD great credit). I estimate I am about 50k in debt now - the majority of which is owed to doctors  labs or medical establishments.-I don’t eat out often. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t party.-I use the gym at my apartment to try to do my physical therapy exercises instead of paying for physical therapy right now.-I love the mountain and on occasion I go to snowboard. That’s a splurge for me. Yes my doctors warn me to be especially careful but they also realize the positive mental benefits and how important that is in healing so they actually support it. Note: Yes I can snowboard down a hill but then cannot stand still straight up for 10 minutes without being very sick. If you understand my illnesses  you’ll understand why that makes sense.-Often other splurges are paid for by people who care about me (I’m grateful)  such as pedicures with my girlfriends or coffee with my sister.  But I’m human.  So sometimes I treat myself to Starbucks.  It is important to treat yourself from time to time  no matter your financial situation.  It’s good for the soul and your money mindset. -I want to work and make my own money again  but I cannot successful right now. I’ve tried my entrepreneurial spirit on countless times since I’ve been sick.  Anytime I’ve gotten momentum  my illnesses have derailed my progress and I fall significantly behind to the point where I have to start over.  Healing takes most of my energy.  -I am trying to “Marie Kondo” my house and SELL anything and everything I can on fb marketplace.  Also  if you live in Northern Virginia and want to donate some things for me to sell  that’s another way you could help.  Thank you to my sister in law for this idea.  That’s my situation in a nutshell.  It’s a lot so I am asking for your help. Please share this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart  Melissa. ♥"

Though her physical body seems to have come through more or less intact  it's less certain how her cognitive abilities will be affected in the long term  which in turn will affect her personal  family  and professional lives.  She has a good prognosis but an unknown timeframe. In the meantime  there are medical bills.Her husband  Brian  described the situation better than I ever could  so permit me to quote from his (ridiculously eloquent) Facebook posts about Jen's stroke: * \"Two weeks ago  Jenifer came down with what we would learn to be an atypical pneumonia  mycoplasma pneumonia. In extremely rare cases  this pneumonia can cause blood clots and  in still rarer cases  strokes. On Sunday night  Jenifer suffered two such strokes resulting in symptoms of aphasia and confusion.\" * Since then  her doctors told her  \"You have had a serious brain trauma. It’s concentrated in the area of the brain associated with higher order cognition- I.e language  memory  and attention. You can navigate your house just fine because that’s automatic  all muscle memory and known spaces. Cooking is okay - again physical and immediate  concrete and in the moment. Reading a detailed recipe or essay  not so much.\"She and Brian have significant known medical bills to pay now  and  perhaps worse  the unknown potential for medical and recovery bills in the future. Even with good health insurance  which Jen and Brian have  a health condition like this is still more expensive than many of us can handle on our own.Though I had to do some arm-twisting  Brian and Jen have acquiesced to my suggestion to do a gofundme campaign. I saw in response to Brian's Facebook posts  not surprisingly  that Jen and Brian have many loving friends and family members who WANT to help them get through this  but don't know how. Many  like myself  live far away so we can't bring over casseroles or babysit children. As a financial planner  I am here to attest that Money Is Very Useful.We're asking for $16 000:$10 000: maximum out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for 2018$4 000: 8 additional weeks of therapy at Frazier Neural Rehab$2 000: Miscellaneous additional medical expenses (CT scans  MRI's  and other diagnostics in 2019  provided no further interventions are necessary). Since Jen's stroke  the Alonzo/Wells household has been down to one income  and their expenses have exploded  thanks to medical bills and the extra care Jen needs. As you can imagine  dealing with this and the holidays with two children is challenging  to say the least. On the one hand  I recognize that asking for financial help from you during the holidays is a Big Ask. On the other  this is what the spirit of the holidays and community--however far flung--are all about  right?  Please help me show and share our love and appreciation for Jen   Brian  Fischer  and Meredith by making a contribution to help cover their medical bills. Their need doesn't stop after the holidays  so if you can't swing it until January or later  please do consider helping them out then. If you have questions  please reach out to me megbartelt@gmail.com (I'm in Bellingham  WA) or Brian via Facebook (if you're craving poetry in the guise of prose)."

Katja is trying to hold it together while caring for her very sick husband  her son Christopher who needs intense medical attention as well  and little Emily.

She has a heart of gold  never judges anyone  and is always the first in line when someone needs help. She has become a sister to me over the years and it is so hard to watch what she has gone through and is going through while being a young mother  during a time which is supposed to be the best years of your life. Katja never asks for help and is a very private person. I did ask her for permission or better lovingly forced her to give me permission to do this for her. Please consider giving whatever you can.

If you can  help before January 2019!!Our dear Maggie (Mona) Hall has been dealing with colon cancer for over 3 years now. It has not been easy by any means  but she has kept working  her personal strength is stunning. The day after Thanksgiving she found out the cancer had become Chemo resistant  and the tumor has grown back to the size it was at diagnosis. She is now on leave from work and she & Nick will be moving into an apartment in our (her parents’) building ASAP. That unit becomes vacant Dec 26th. The timing is horrible I know. Here is why we are asking for your help: 1) Movers run about $2000 - Maggie & Nick’s current apartment is on the third floor with no elevator  there is no way to do it without professionals given the volume of stuff they have. We need to be out of that apartment by Jan 1st. Packing help is wanted too! 2) Budgeting $1000 for a second opinion consult with Dr. Lentz at USC  one of the leading doctors in the world for colorectal cancer  plus any tests he needs to run. Because Maggie has Kaiser insurance and Dr. Lentz is non-Kaiser  it needs to be paid out of pocket. We are hoping future treatment there will be covered by Kaiser but that's iffy. 3) Rental on a storage unit for 6 months  $1000. Since they will be downsizing from a 2-bedroom to a one-bedroom  they’ll need to store their extra stuff; this will be about $160 per month for at least 6 months while we find new homes for some very cool stuff. and 4) Other annoying expenses like health insurance (HAH!)  may be asked for in the future as a tier 2 request  but right now we need $4000 minimum to get things started.So  anyway the main thing is: Maggie needs more support than we can swing right now. If you have the ability to help out either with physical labor packing things up or with donations to help make this move & immediate medical care affordable  we would all be so appreciative.  Maggie is our treasure & she probably is special to you as well. We hate asking for help like this   but time is short & this is vital stuff. Please help if you can.

Through it all  she's remained positive  loving  an incredible mom  and one of the strongest people any of us know. She rarely asks for help (and doesn't even want to ask for it now)  but now is the time she needs her friends and family to help her most. Recently  Harper found a lump in her breast. This resulted in a a bi-lateral lumpectomy surgery  and she was diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast Cancer. Her next course of action is 6 weeks of radiation. She's feeling very positive  but still has a long road ahead.Unfortunately  most of the tests and labs were done before her new health insurance kicked in. Which has resulted in a pretty big hospital tab. Additionally  her new insurance does not cover her entire surgery/radiation and will need to pay a decent amount out of pocket. And she'll need to start making these payments soon. Helping Harper will assist her in paying her hospital bills  but also child care. She's still new to Philly and doesn't have the same network she had in Charleston (yet)  so she'll need childcare/extra helping hands while she's recovering and going through treatment. I know most of us wish we could figure out a way to help her through this. Right now  this is one of the best ways to help her. It will truly help ease her stress about money  bills  childcare and get back to a sense of normalcy for her and Ever. Update: It says this campaign benefits Mary Poe. Harper's first name is \"Mary\"  just in case you didn't know aka it's going to the right person."

Afterward  she worked hard through a painful and difficult recovery to walk again  only to learn that another tumor has now returned. Doctors have termed it ‘very aggressive’ and told her that surgery is not an option.Chemo is the prescribed treatment and presently she has waited over seven week for insurance to approve it.Making matters worse  and on top of everything else  earlier this month Jennifer was terminated from her job because of her extended inability to work.

Heather moved in November to start her new job as a teacher at a local daycare  while Vinny stayed behind in Scranton to finish his last few weeks of work with the intent of joining Heather and Amelie the first week of January in time for Aoife’s birth  their first child together. While in Scranton for the Christmas holiday  Vinny began to feel ill and by December 30th was in the hospital with a potentially fatal condition called sepsis. Vinny’s last day of work was December 23rd and his health insurance covered him until December 31st. He will now have to pay out-of-pocket to contribute to COBRA in order to keep his coverage  but he has no income to do so.Vinny has endured many complications and procedures the past week  including surgery  a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia and damaged lungs. With that comes numerous labs  scans  blood tests  fluids  plus a lengthy stay at the hospital etc. It all adds up. What’s worse  there is a chance he will have to be intubated and placed in an induced coma to allow his severely damaged lungs to heal. There is a good change he is going to miss the birth of his first child  but his optimism is humbling. This evening he told me he’s made peace with the fact he may not be present for her birth. “I’d rather miss the birth of my child than miss the lives of both she and Amelie (who has become a daughter to him).”Meanwhile  my nearly 9-months pregnant sister  is also trying to support herself  Amelie and unborn daughter on one very small income to stay afloat while Daddy Vinny gets well enough to return to them. Heather is struggling to afford childcare currently  but will soon be faced with the challenge of having no income during her unpaid maternity leave. She and Amelie are currently sharing a bedroom at a dear friend’s house until they are stable enough to afford an apartment of their own.WHAT HAPPENED?On the evening of December 30th  my 8 1/2-months pregnant sister  Heather  rushed her boyfriend Vinny to the Regional Hospital of Scranton Emergency Room. When they arrived at the entrance  Vinny stepped out of the passenger side  vomited  and in my sister’s words  “closed the door with his face” as he collapsed and temporarily lost consciousness. After futile attempts to lift him herself  Heather’s cries for help were heard and help came running to assist Vinny into the ER. The diagnosis? Severe Sepsis caused by a tooth infection. Sepsis  depending on how severe  is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by your immune system’s response to an infection. Without timely treatment  sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage  organ failure  and death. Vinny was likely days away from his condition turning fatal. Within the first few days of the sepsis diagnosis  Vinny went through powerful antibiotic treatments  emergency surgery to remove a tooth and drain an abscess  and was also diagnosed with lung damage and pneumonia. Now  there is a chance he will have to be intubated and placed in an induced coma to allow his severely damaged lungs to heal. He will be in the hospital for at least another week  if not more.WHAT WILL THESE FUNDS HELP WITH?I’m hoping these funds will be available to help Vinny and Heather pay for medical bills as well as living expenses until they are both able to bring in an income. They will specifically pay for:-Vinny’s growing medical expenses.-Supplemental income for Vinny  Heather and Amelie after baby Aoife is born (my sister has to go on 6 to 12-week unpaid maternity leave).-Childcare- for before Aoife is born  so my sister can work.-Food-Bills and daily expensesThe clock is really ticking on this one. Heather is due January 27th  but could go into labor at any moment. So the sooner they have some funds  the better. All the funds will go directly to Vinny and Heather. Those of you who have the pleasure of knowing Heather  Vinny and Amelie can attest to their amazing character  love  kindness and generosity to everyone they meet. Please join me in raising them up during this difficult but joyous time in their lives. All my love and appreciation Michelle Bixby"

Within 3 months the body will naturally get rid of these dead  frozen tumor cells and the immune system will be boosted at the same time to regain strength and health.Jenn needs a couple of these treatments because the body can digest only so many dead cancer cells at once.

We need the help of friends  family  and even strangers. We are in dire need of saving Consuella's life  a mother of 2 amazing young children aged 4 and 13.  Consuella is a young 36 year old woman who has an opportunity to live a long and fruitful life with her children. Consuella has severely damaged lungs from a condition called Pulmonary Fibrosis which offers a lifespan of 5 years on average from diagnosis. Today we are fundraising for a lung transplant and to help her and the people helping alleviate a lot of the stress and burden of her care. Each day adds more pressure and stress to the situation. With limited resources and funds  the family and Consuella have been stretched very thin. If you are a stranger reading this please read her story and picture this amazing woman as your friend  sister  or daughter. She loves every person she meets and approaches life with an infectious smile and unwavering optimism. You cannot help but smile when she smiles. Consuella has always put everyone else's needs before her own  friends  family  and even strangers. We are hoping that her life of helping strangers will come full circle and be returned to her in spades. The costs of saving Consuellas life are within reach and achievable. We can all save a life today  we can save a mother  a friend  and my daughter. Lung Transplants are normally $1M  with additional fees incurred of over $6K per month in medical costs not covered; this amount does not include medication required before and after; that is not covered by health insurance which will be required once the transplant takes place of over $500 monthly so that the body does not reject the lungs. In addition  a  family member (medical caregiver) must dedicate their lives to ensuring Consuella has the proper care she needs 24/7  this is a mandatory requirement before  during  and after in order for her to be considered for a lung transplant. Without this  in place  there will be no consideration. Funds raised will allow me  Consuella's Mother   to care for her 24/7 and to serve as the beneficiary and manager of funds raised. Please  I am kindly asking that you make a donation today. Any sized donation will go a long way and help save my daughters life. If you cannot make a donation today please share our story with your friends and family within your social circles. perhaps someone you know is willing to help or to share further. Thank you!

She was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was just 5 days old. After 19 years and the latest bout of the flu last January  she was told that she will need a lung transplant. Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that starts when the cells don’t release salt properly. Due to this  Analiese’s body produces a thick mucus that clogs her pancreatic ducts  intestines  sinus cavity and lungs. She suffers from frequent upper respiratory infections and illness. Because of this  she describes her daily battle to breathe  similar to the same sensation as plugging your nose and taking every breath as if through a straw.Her case is more complicated because she also has Hyper IGD syndrome. The combination of the two diseases makes her a frequent ER visitor and resident at the U of I. She spent 104 days of 2018 in the hospital and is currently back due to severe inflammation and respiratory infections.Despite what Analiese is going through  the Chapman’s are lucky. Community members who love and support Analiese surround them. For years  they have worn Analiese’s face on their T-shirts  held walkathons to raise funds and awareness for Cystic Fibrosis  lined up to visit her in the hospital  and followed her journey through social media – all under the Team Analiese banner.Maybe you know Analiese. Maybe you knew her when she went four-wheeling or volunteered with the Riverdale Fire Department. Maybe you met her in college classes or when she worked at the community college bookstore. Maybe you know that she likes art  caring for her nieces  competing in water fights  sitting around a bonfire in her backyard  cooking dinners for her parents  or spending time with her friends – all the activities 19 year-olds enjoy.So now  Team Analiese has a new mission. Analiese needs new lungs so she can get back to all those things. And we need you to join us.Why we need support-While Analiese’s health insurance will help cover major medical expenses  it does not cover everything. The Chapmans live more than an hour from Iowa City where the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics are  that has been treating Analiese since she was a baby. We expect Analiese will get much sicker as she is waiting for her new lungs. Her mom has already taken a leave of absence from work because Analiese has gotten so sick and will have to take off another minimum of 3 months to take care of her during recovery. All while her dad travels back and forth from their home in LeClaire  Iowa to keep working.Your donations-Your donations will help the family with expenses related to her lung transplant- travel  hotel  bills  food  etc. After surgery  if things go smoothly  Analiese will spend some time in the ICU and about two weeks in the hospital. When she’s released from the hospital  she’ll need to spend two to four weeks within 30 minutes of the hospital in case complications arise. When she is finally able to go home  she’ll need to travel back to the hospital each week or sometimes more for testing. Your donations will help with lodging; food  transportation  and time off Analiese’s parents need to take to be by her side. What you can do right now-Register to be an organ donor: Analiese needs new lungs  and we know that can only happen because a caring individual in life decided to donate their organs after death. Please register to donate. You won’t need you organs when you pass away  and people like Analiese will make good use of them. It gives them a second chance at life. Learn how to register in your state here:  https://www.organdonor.gov.Donate to this campaign: Your generous donations will keep this family afloat while they are facing one of the toughest medical trials of Analiese’s life.

He is a young male  but we can't contact him and proceed with further testing until insurance approves Duke to do the transplant. If he is determined not to match  we will then go with an unmatched cord blood donor.  We are not asking anyone else to donate bone marrow at this time  as by the time the swabs get mailed and put in the system she would have already had her transplant. Time is ticking and we can't wait any longer for a \"perfect\" match. :(Brelynn suffers from a form of Combined Variable Immune Deficiency specifically called IKAROS. It is a gene defect. It causes her to make no B cells and only partial T cells function. This leaves her open to lots of infection. Brelynn was a little over two-years old the first time she was in public. Over the years  we have tried to make her life more normal taking her to dinner  allowing her to play at the park  even taking her to the movies for a special evening. As time goes on  Brelynn has proven she is more sickly. Based off the limited knowledge they do have  it is apparent Brelynn will only get sicker from here. It is best to do the transplant now  while she is considered well with minimal organ damage. Over time the pneumonia's she has had yearly  as well as various infections will eventually take their toll.To date the researchers have discovered 13 patients with this gene mutation. 3 children have had transplants of the 13  one passed and 2 are living. If we can find a close match Brelynn's chance of successful outcome is about 80%. This would completely cure her and revamp her immune system. She would no longer have weekly infusions  Pentamidine treatments  etc. She could go to school  be in public just like normal children. There are medications she would have to take and still see doctors to confirm everything is working like it should. There are lists of complications that I don't want to talk about unless they happen. Some minor and some causing organ failure and fatality.Our plan at this time is to move to Duke 3 weeks prior to transplant for chemo. She will have extensive treatments to completely wipe out her immune system that she does have. Once there we will be in the hospital for 2 months give or take. I have a list of 10 of the closest family members and they are the only ones that will be allowed to visit Brelynn while in the hospital. It is very important that she not get sick while the cells are grafting. After the 2 months in the hospital  we will move to the house with Scotty  Bryson and Granny for at the least 4 months. If she gets sick at any time of course the stays for all of this will change. We were told to be prepared for 6 months to a year in NC.The doctors asked that I have at least 1 to 2 people with me at all times during this because Brelynn can never be left alone in the hospital room  for support and caring for her round the clock. I will need breaks as well even though I will be staying at the hospital with her.Ronald McDonald does not provide living arrangements for more than 2 people in the family. They can only accommodate one bedroom and obviously we cannot all stay there.I was told that the transplant team does own a home  but as of right now they have a family staying there. I have been looking at homes for rent in the area and on average they are $850-$1300 per month. Meanwhile  we have to pay our bills here  house payment  etc. and will have to live there (rent  lights  food  insurance  etc). I'm starting the fundraising now so when the time comes we hope to not have to worry about bills while being with our daughter for the fight for her life.I have been granted a one-year leave of absence from work. My husband  Scotty will be taking the 6 months off to go to Duke with us. We initially tried to get a transfer  but her doctors decided that was not the best decision because he works in the public and that would bring germs into the hospital/home to Brelynn that could make her very sick or potentially kill her. We will still have to pay his job for our normal expenditures  health insurance  retirement  etc during this time. Also  we were informed once insurance approves  they will debate with Duke Children's Hospital on how much they are willing to pay. Example: Insurance agrees to pay 80 000 and the hospital charges 100 000 we will be responsible for paying the 20 000 up front for her transplant. To the ones that want to contribute  we have set a goal of 30 000. If we exceed that amount any money not spent at Duke will be put in an account for Brelynn later in life or whenever she needs it.Please above all keep us in constant prayer and any contribution is greatly appreciated.Love from all of us  Brelynn and Seeger Family"

She has kept her medical issues private for the most part but things have taken a turn for the worst and we need everyone’s help to help her and her family. Crystal has already fought the battle with cancer once and by God’s Grace she beat it! But just like we all know -cancer has a mind of its own. They have found more cancer on the protective layer between her brain and skull and also some spots on her liver. She initially was told about 4 weeks ago that she only had 2 more months to live. Imagine being told that and having to tell your 11 year old son and your loving husband that they may have to live life without you? This is unimaginable for most of us. Her drs have now made a plan and we are all hoping and praying this chemo and radiation she is going through will help Crystal to live a long and happy life with her family. Due to her illness  Crystal has not been able to work since close to the end of 2018. She has now lost her health insurance which means one weeks worth of her medication is $500 that her family is having to pay out of pocket! And that doesn’t even count the medical bills piling up from being in and out of the hospital. It took a lot of convincing to even let us do any type of fundraising for Crystal as she and her husband are never looking for a handout. But they can’t fight this fight alone! They need our help and ANY amount can help towards her living a longer life. If you aren’t able to donate please say a prayer for Crystal and her family.

I hope you take the time to read Beth’s story and find it in your heart to help her out in any way you can. This is an urgent situation!Beth is having surgery within a month! She is scared  and has every right to be. This is a big surgery  but one that will hopefully change her life for the better. She is currently out of work for the most part due to the level of pain she is in  and then after surgery she will be recovering for some time and will be completely without income. Those who know Beth know she would give you her last dollar if she could. She is one of the most caring  and loving humans I know. She loves the outdoors and spends a lot of her time hiking with friends and solo. She is witty  crass  talented  and one of my favorite people who I force to watch scary movies with. Beth HATES to ask for help  as she has been hustling since the moment she arrived in the city of angels. After her surgery she will be down anywhere from 3-6 months  depending on how her surgery goes and how she recovers. She has past medical bills she still pays for  as well as her standard living expenses. She’s heading into this surgery not knowing how she will be able to support herself. The stress is a lot  and really takes a toll on her mentally and physically. During this time of giving  I ask for your love and donation to help our girl heal without added stress. She needs to focus on recovery and get back out hiking  working out  and being the fun  silly Beth we know and love. You can read her entire story below of how this started  what she has done to help her situation  and how she got to this scary point of spine surgery. Beth’s Story:From the ages of 15–28  Beth has been living with a debilitating spine disorder called Juvenile Disc Disease. Basically  a degenerative disc disease that is quite uncommon in anyone under the age of 50.She was kicked off her parents’ insurance plan (not their doing) as soon as she graduated college at the age of 22. She moved out here to L.A. with hopes and dreams that were quickly dashed as her health continued to deteriorate; She needed to hold down a steady enough job so that she could procure health insurance.  She was subjected to steroid injections  epidural injections  trigger point injections (of which you don’t get anesthetic for); all the opiates (because that’s what they’re peddling)  physical therapy  acupuncture  and even the option to “freeze” her nerves. She opted out of freezing her nerves as a last-ditch effort to control the heaping amounts of debilitating pain she was. When she was 25  she had the spine of a 65-year-old woman; arthritis  most of her spine was bone on bone  and what discs were left were slipped or bulging by the age of 28. Beth then had stem cells from a clinic in Hollywood. She was at the point where she could barely stand for more than an hour or two. This helped her greatly  and gave her back so much of her life. During the past five years her life has been relatively pain free. The gift of not being in a wheelchair  of not having to have constant medical procedure “Band-Aids” unleashed on her has been extraordinary. However  not all gifts last forever  her spine disease has come back this past year  and in full force: Two of Beth’s discs are already “dead”  three are bulging  one or two have spurs on them  and one has slipped so much this past year. The ultimate fear is that she could become paralyzed if a surgery doesn’t happen. Please send your love and positive vibes to Beth."

On January 2nd  2011 Staci called her family with horrifying news that she had been in a car accident with her mom  step dad  and daughter. The medics believed her to be okay despite being t-boned by a truck on her side of the vehicle at 60 miles an hour. Months went by and she slowly started losing weight and noticing internal pain. She started seeing doctor after doctor and by January 2012 a gastrointestinal doctor believed it was her gall bladder causing the pain. She had emergency surgery to remove it  but months later the pain was still there. Staci has always described her pain as a lady with high heels standing on top of her. By May of 2012  she had gone from 145 pounds down to 120 and it was painful for her to eat and drink. She went to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and they discovered Pelvic Congestion Syndrome and performed an embolism to help address the condition. She was still having pain and by the end of the summer of 2012 they told her there was nothing more they could do. Staci continued to try and find the underlying problem and thankfully she had an angel on her side. Angie was an ultrasound technician that worked for her family doctor and spent endless hours doing research of Staci’s symptoms. Angie believed that Staci had a rare syndrome called Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS) and asked the GI Doctor to order a specific test. Finally  in September of 2012  after another series of tests and a year-and-a-half after the car accident  we received news that she did in fact have SMAS. Staci went back to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville only to be told that many doctors do not believe SMAS is real. SMAS  or Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome  is the compression of the 3rd portion of the duodenum between the Abdominal Aorta (AA) and the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA). SMAS is also known as Wilkie’s Syndrome or Cast Syndrome. SMAS can develop naturally or due to traumatic injury. There are other related symptoms and syndromes such as Nutcracker Syndrome  Pelvic Varicose Veins  Reverse Peristalsis  Gastroparesis  Gallbladder failure  and Malabsorption Syndrome. Here is a picture which describes the SMA compression of the Duodenum causing the inability to eat and drink normally:By November of 2012  Staci’ weight was down to 102 pounds and they needed to do something so  they scheduled Duodenum bypass surgery at Johns Hopkins in Maryland. The goal was to bypass the compressed section of the Duodenum so she could eat and drink normally. The family believed it had fixed her and Staci was able to eat  drink  and began gaining weight. She was up to 120 pounds and finally had relief but  roughly 6 months later  the issues seriously returned.The pain and weight loss continued. Through online support groups they discovered a doctor in Virginia that had studied under Dr. Sandmann  a German physician that had performed and perfected SMA transposition surgeries. In February of 2016 the family made the trip to Virginia and Staci received a SMA transposition surgery where the Superior Mesenteric Artery is detached from the aortic artery and reattached at a lower point to remove compression of the intestines. Once again Staci felt much improved. Her appetite was back  the pain lessened  and she began to gain weight. Unfortunately  this is the song that never ends. She returned to Virginia in pain and tests showed that her renal vein was being crushed potentially by scar tissue. The solution was to do a bovine graft on the vein. Once again  that surgery made Staci feel improved only to feel worse again. This same cycle has been going on for almost 8 years now.SMAS is a very rare disease that has only affected between .013 - .3% of the population. Staci and her daughter Tara have been all over the country seeing doctors and have yet to find anyone who will do the surgery that Dr. Sandmann has perfected in Germany. Dr. Sandmann will go in and do everything at once versus addressing the issues one at a time. Therefore  her only hope of survival is to travel to Germany and have the surgery.  The cost of the surgery is between $50-$60 000 and is not covered by American Health Insurance. It would also require a lengthy stay in a hotel after surgery to do follow up appointments and Staci will need a family member with her to assist with recovery and care.As a family we are foregoing Christmas gifts this year and donating to Staci in memory of my beautiful sister  JoAnn DiMaso  who passed away from Cancer on October 31st. JoAnn would want us to start this fund as she was all about helping others  especially family.  We are asking for any donation you are able to make and hope to raise atleast $75 000 to pay for the consult  travel to Germany  surgery and necessary lodging and other expenses that will be incurred. Staci is an incredible person who spends all of her time helping other SMAS patients and their families and  with your help  this life saving surgery could pave the way for others. Thank you in advance for your generosity.Here are some before and after pictures of Staci:"

I hope you take the time to read Beth’s story and find it in your heart to help her out in any way you can. This is an urgent situation!Beth is having surgery within a month! She is scared  and has every right to be. This is a big surgery  but one that will hopefully change her life for the better. She is currently out of work for the most part due to the level of pain she is in  and then after surgery she will be recovering for some time and will be completely without income. Those who know Beth know she would give you her last dollar if she could. She is one of the most caring  and loving humans I know. She loves the outdoors and spends a lot of her time hiking with friends and solo. She is witty  crass  talented  and one of my favorite people who I force to watch scary movies with. Beth HATES to ask for help  as she has been hustling since the moment she arrived in the city of angels. After her surgery she will be down anywhere from 3-6 months  depending on how her surgery goes and how she recovers. She has past medical bills she still pays for  as well as her standard living expenses. She’s heading into this surgery not knowing how she will be able to support herself. The stress is a lot  and really takes a toll on her mentally and physically. During this time of giving  I ask for your love and donation to help our girl heal without added stress. She needs to focus on recovery and get back out hiking  working out  and being the fun  silly Beth we know and love. You can read her entire story below of how this started  what she has done to help her situation  and how she got to this scary point of spine surgery. Beth’s Story:From the ages of 15–28  Beth has been living with a debilitating spine disorder called Juvenile Disc Disease. Basically  a degenerative disc disease that is quite uncommon in anyone under the age of 50.She was kicked off her parents’ insurance plan (not their doing) as soon as she graduated college at the age of 22. She moved out here to L.A. with hopes and dreams that were quickly dashed as her health continued to deteriorate; She needed to hold down a steady enough job so that she could procure health insurance.  She was subjected to steroid injections  epidural injections  trigger point injections (of which you don’t get anesthetic for); all the opiates (because that’s what they’re peddling)  physical therapy  acupuncture  and even the option to “freeze” her nerves. She opted out of freezing her nerves as a last-ditch effort to control the heaping amounts of debilitating pain she was. When she was 25  she had the spine of a 65-year-old woman; arthritis  most of her spine was bone on bone  and what discs were left were slipped or bulging by the age of 28. Beth then had stem cells from a clinic in Hollywood. She was at the point where she could barely stand for more than an hour or two. This helped her greatly  and gave her back so much of her life. During the past five years her life has been relatively pain free. The gift of not being in a wheelchair  of not having to have constant medical procedure “Band-Aids” unleashed on her has been extraordinary. However  not all gifts last forever  her spine disease has come back this past year  and in full force: Two of Beth’s discs are already “dead”  three are bulging  one or two have spurs on them  and one has slipped so much this past year. The ultimate fear is that she could become paralyzed if a surgery doesn’t happen. Please send your love and positive vibes to Beth."

The CT Scan revealed a mass on her liver.Having Stage II Breast Cancer is one thing  but a distant metastasis to the liver is quite another.

Nor have we seen the results of the latest CT Scan. As we know  we'll update this page with information.Thankfully  Didi feels fantastic! The only symptom she has had was a tender lymph node. Her blood work is perfect!Regardless  the late stage and two completely unrelated pathologies  constrains our treatment options. Although we are hopeful to find a path of longevity (with continued quality)  our Health Insurance will only cover certain treatments. Some well documented alternate treatments may require international travel. In addition   Sam has not worked in his current position long enough to qualify for family-disability leave and needless to say  high Health Insurance premiums and sky-high deductibles foretell difficult financial waters as well.We are keeping the goal low for now  until we have some specifics to share.

In December of 2018​ after a long illness that was first diagnosed as ​\"flu hypertension headaches ​\" their ​unexpected yet worst fears were confirmed.  Not only had her ​breast cancer returned but it had ​also spread to multiple lymph nodes in her chest  left lung  ​along with multiple tumors in her brain. Heather's treatment ​has been aggressive including monthly injections  oral medications   chemotherapy at Mercy Oncology in Portland  additional radiation appointments in Augusta as well as ​appointments at Dana Farber in Boston to plan ​possible experimental treatments via ​information gathered from CT and PET scans.At the same time  their daughter Paige also ​fell ill.  After a spending a week at Waldo County General with a misdiagnosis of MRSA  Paige was sent home where her condition worsened.  She was ​later referred and admitted to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor where she ​was treated for over one month.  They ​eventually found that she was suffering from Crohn's disease.  Paige endured ​over 15 surgeries during her stay and is continuing treatment at home. ​She and her family are required to make regular trips to Bangor ​(over an hour away) for infusions of Crohn's medication and iron supplements.  She will need monthly followups ​from the surgeries for the foreseeable future and has a long road of recovery ahead of her.While Matt  Heather's husband and Paige's father  does have health insurance through his employer  both of their illnesses spanned two years​. ​Maximum out of pocket was hit within two months.   Costly premiums  high co-pays  and those out-of-pocket costs for items not covered by their plan are piling up ​fast with more bills to follow as the hospital billing department continues to catch up.  Matt has had to take unpaid family leave from work ​to care for his family compounding the lack of income to the bills ​that keep coming in.  Heather is obviously unable to work so her ​past ability to create and contribute income ​to the family has stopped while she receives her treatments. This year will be a difficult one on all fronts. The money donated here is intended to aid in paying the many medical bills they have already received and hopefully help with the bills in their foreseeable future.  ​Beyond medical bills  there is heat  electricity  car repairs  and the basic necessities needed to provide a safe home to recover.

However  she learned in August that she had an aggressive form of breast cancer and plans changed. As Jayna had just finished her postdoc  she was no longer covered by health insurance. Instead of returning to U.S. to get treated  she opted to stay abroad and get treatment in France and Spain. Unfortunately  she had  very limited time remaining on her visa and was paying for medical treatment as well as 50 000 000 plane tickets to fly from France to countries outside the Schengen Area  returning to France for the day for a medical appointment  and flying out the same day. The silver lining is that Jayna has not been going through this alone.

Then  one year ago today  on October 24  2017  Wendy suffered a significant head injury at home. She lost consciousness and fell head first onto her bathroom floor. Wendy's neighbor rushed her to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a severe concussion.

It compromises the immune system. The tick bite can bring on several different other types of serious infections. It can leave a person weak  bedridden  with little quality of life. This is the state of our daughter is in. It kills us to watch her suffering each new day. Effective treatments of Lyme in the early stages is a common offering. It's covered by insurance. Lyme that goes undetected or misdiagnosed requires specific treatments from medical specialists. These treatments are rarely covered by health insurance. Lyme and it’s co-infections can often go undetected. They share many common symptoms with other conditions. And as such  Lyme often sneaks under the radar and the conditions continue to worsen.And this is what happened to our daughter. She was bit by a deer tick when she was a child. There were was not a tell-tale bulls-eye rash. Despite many lab tests  her Lymes went misdiagnosed for many painful years. Caitlin suffered from fatigue  unexplained rashes  infections  bronchitis  migraines  and other debilitating symptoms. Her body was losing the battle against stealth-like  disease-producing microbes. Over time  her symptoms intensified. She began to have joint pain  fevers  swollen lymph nodes  small blood vessel inflammations  night sweats and tachcardia.   She became unable to sleep well at night. She went to scores of specialists  who gave many different diagnoses  none of which made sense. After tons of lab work  Caitlin received a diagnosis of Chronic Lyme’s Disease. Along with a severe co-infection of Bartonella. Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete called Borrelia.  It changes shapes and moves into different tissues and compartments and can change forms to evade being killed.   Bartonella are bacteria that live primarily inside the lining of the blood vessels.  Both form biofilms and cysts  making the bacteria difficult to kill.    A person with a co-infection experiences more symptoms  and a longer recovery.   For more information please look at:    www.lymedisease.org. By the winter of 2018 Caitlin became bedridden  unable to attend her college classes. She began to have cognitive and neurological symptoms.  Caitlin's pain is unrelenting.After all the expenses involved in arriving at a diagnosis. After all the frustration and pain. There is now hope. She's accepted into treatment by a rheumatologist out of Yale. One considered the leading doctor in beating Lyme. His patients have a very high recovery rate. And we have confidence that he will do the same for Caitlin.  Chronic Lyme and Bartonella usually takes two years of monthly treatment to recover.  The treatments are expensive  not covered by insurance  and out of pocket for the patients.   We pray every day for our child’s recovery. We're asking for any help towards covering her treatment expenses. Any donation of any size is a huge help.If you would be so kind  please help us share this Go Fund Me Page with others. It’s crucial to successful recovery of our daughter. We need to reach as many potential contributors as possible.Bless you  and thank you for your consideration and support.Caitlin’s Mom  Dad  and Brother: Diana  Les  and Ian McLean"

She's the teacher who is always willing to listen to a parents concern  who does everything in her power to make sure that our little ones have a good day and are happy learners. She's patient  kind  loving and extremely hard-working. She's always helping others and now it's our turn to return the favor. How can 2 people with good jobs  working overtime  with one child and a small house fall between the healthcare cracks?  They are just over the limit to receive aid .They were faced with the choice to pay almost as much as their mortgage for insurance or go uninsured. Their child gets healthcare through a school policy  though expensive and incomplete. Tate has forgone health insurance the past few years because it would mean getting a third job and not being available for her daughter. A healthy young adult  she hoped she would resolve this in the coming years.Over the past few months she has suffered excruciating pain  diagnosed as a very large kidney stone  blocking her kidney and causing infection and swelling in the surrounding organs. She was advised to have surgery immediately to save her kidney and prevent infections from causing an even more critical problem.Imagine her surprise  sitting in the admitting room on the day of the surgery when the flustered doctor appeared to tell her that because she has no insurance  she could not be treated. The doctor had called other hospitals and none would take her.Eventually an advocate found treatment for her at Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon. She is working to solve her insurance issue  but she will still need support. Her costs will be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Every year Auburn Montessori chooses an organization- the homeless shelters  Mothers in transition  animal rescues  and raise money for a good cause. It reminds children that giving is as important as receiving. Why shouldn’t we take on the needs of one of our own? Tate works 40+ hours a week and gives every Saturday to a horse rescue center. She is probably the most kind  conscientious  giving  hard working woman I have ever met. Please  if you know her  and you are in the mind to help and support someone in need this season  consider giving to our GOFUNDME account."

Treatments will be continual and ongoing the rest of her life. Eva suffers also from a partially collapsed lung and a compound fracture caused by the breakdown of the bone in her spine which is adding to her debilitating back pain. She will soon be having radiation treatments for the severe pain in the spine and other areas of her body. Because this cancer is hormone positive  they are planning on controlling it by blocking the hormone production. They will put Eva into menopause.  This will stop the production of estrogen the cancer thrives on  the doctors are planning to remove her ovaries very soon. Then control further spread with a hormonal treatment. Since chemotherapy can't cure the bones  they aren't going to put her through the torture of that treatment  it wouldn't solve the problem.   If that's not enough  she is also anemic and the infusions are $400/week out of pocket  that's after insurance pays their portion of the $7 000.00 per treatment.  They hope she wont need too many. The funds we raise will aid in medication  medical out of pocket  lower paychecks from days missed at work during absences for treatment  out of pocket expenses  travel  and just by helping in general to close the gap caused by this illness. Other ways Eva can use help.....cooking freezable dishes! Eva seems the most concerned about keeping her little mouths fed without turning to fast food or dry cereal and milk. Fast food is unhealthy and will add to the family's regular grocery bill where they are u⁴ will help  casseroles  freezer meals  etc.  The family is going to look for a deep freeze this week to store frozen meals in. Eva is trying to prepare to be down a little while to get this going and under control but she's already not able to stand in the kitchen.  A donated freezer would be greatly appreciated as were hoping to fill it with premade meals.  This situation is time sensitive because of how quick this has all transpired  the sudden and quick financial burden  even with health insurance  is quickly taking its toll on this 2 income family of 6. We are also taking cash donations at the office if you are local to Springtown  TX. We're using any cash donated for groceries.

She just moved to NYC from Canandaigua two years ago and has no family in NYC. She had to borrow 20 sick days in order to take maternity leave. She is not allowed to borrow more than 20 days. If she goes beyond 20 days  she will go off payroll and lose her health insurance. Her family depends upon her for health insurance and for her income. She will start chemotherapy in 3 days. She will need to take 50 sick days to cover the time that she will have to take off from work for the chemotherapy treatment and the two operations. I would like to raise enough money for her to purchase those 50 sick days. She is able to \"buy\" days from the Department of Education for $280 per day. This will allow her to stay on payroll and keep her health insurance.I deeply understand what Alyson is going through  as I was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and I also had an 11 month old daughter at the time. I was incredibly fortunate to have the entire school community come to my aid. They enabled me to get enough sick days to not have to work while undergoing chemotherapy and I feel so grateful to now be in a position to help Alyson receive the same aid that I was lucky enough to receive. It is exhausting going through chemotherapy when you have an infant who is still waking up throughout the night. In addition  working in an elementary school exposes the body to so many bacteria and viruses  it is just not safe to be in that environment when one's immune system is so compromised.If you are able to help Alyson in any way  she would be so forever grateful. If we are able to raise more than the $14 000 she will need to buy her sick days  Alyson will use the additional funds to pay for co-pays  a wig  travel expenses to and from chemotherapy and any other additional medical expenses she may incur.Thank you so much and best wishes to you all Victoria Lavington"

On January 4  David was tentatively diagnosed with  MS. During the week preceding his birthday  February 3  things began to change rapidly. His falling increased  and it became obvious he could no longer wait to see the MS specialist. At the advice of the Neurologist  he entered St David's Hospital in Austin on Feb. 4th   where a team of doctors ran many more tests. The diagnosis of Tumefactive MS was made  he was treated with steroids  and he was sent home with an appointment to see an MS/Autoimmune specialist 2 days later. When David saw the doctor  Feb. 14th  she sent him straight to Dell Seton emergency to be admitted.  After the doctors saw the results of an MRI taken on Feb. 11th  at St David's  they performed another MRI and decided to do a brain biopsy. Finally an answer  just not what we wanted to hear. David has an inoperable brain tumor in the cortex of the frontal lobe. It is a Primary Bcell CNS lymphoma. The good news is that it is classified stage 1 because it hasn't spread anywhere else.  Dave is undergoing chemotherapy now. He has completed the first round and goes back for the second round next week. Today he is a patient at the Central Texas Rehabilitation Hospital. He has been in the hospital minus 2 days since Feb. 4th. When he goes back for chemo on March 13  he will be back at Dell Seton. David's spirit continues to amaze me. He always says  \"God brought me to it  and I know He will get me through it.\" Denise is working at their shop and driving to Austin in the afternoons. They covet your prayers  which they depend on and can feel daily. So many people have asked how else they can help that I set up this page to provide one way. Although they have health insurance the expenses for treatment are staggering  and simple things like the gas back and forth everyday are mounting up. David is going to need a ramp at the house when he gets to come home.  He is also going to need an adjustable bed as well as potential other modifications at home.Denise and David have given so much to so many that I convinced her to let me allow others to help them. They are humbled at the outpouring of love  prayers  and visits that they have already received.We are continually amazed by what God does everyday. We are praying for His healing as He guides the doctors."

Oct. 3rd  our wonderful  talented sweet 24 yr old son Landon was involved in a very serious car wreck where the driver side was crushed in by a concrete guardrail. He was knocked unconscious and badly bleeding to death internally. His best friend Trevor held him in his arms waiting for EMS personnel to arrive  keeping him alert once he gained consciousness and all the while thinking Landon might die in his arms right there. Landon had been totally crushed in between the door and the center console. Somehow with a huge burst of adrenaline he was painfully able to lift himself out of that small crushed in car area. Gratefully  no other persons were hurt in this tragic accident. Landon was actually out doing business errands on his day off  in his best suit (and there were no drugs or alcohol or reckless driving involved in the event.) Just a scary  awful  freak  automobile accident.Landon amazingly survived and was rushed to a trauma center here in Austin  Texas (at Saint David’s South Hospital) and underwent emergency surgery to repair a lacerated liver  ruptured bladder  and damaged bleeding stomach  stopping the major bleeding. He also suffered from multiple lung contusions  fractured ribs  severe bruising and other cuts from glass  as well as a tracheal hematoma. His pelvis has more fractures then you can really count  it was basically shattered. Landon was in the ICU trauma unit for a week  then moved to another recovery room for another long week. His mother Tiffany was by his side almost 24/7  the entire time  advocating for very best care & pain management for Landon while in the hospital during this excruciating crisis.Two days later after the first surgery  he went through another complicated Orthopedic surgery to put his pelvis back together with large metal screw pins. Landon has undergone a lot of severe pain  but is determined to recuperate. Thankfully we requested the help of a pain management specialist who finally got the right medication cocktail to help manage Landon’s pain without him becoming addicted to painkillers in this healing process. During one long stretch in the ICU he had 12 different tubes in different parts of his body and was on about a dozen different medications!“Landitty”  as he’s affectionately referred to by friends  has a long road ahead of him as his full recovery will take at least a year. Much of his physical rehabilitation and huge hospital bill are not covered by his community medical care program. His mother Tiffany has gladly made quick life adjustments in order to be his full-time caretaker  but she is not trained in medical rehabilitation. Landon needs ongoing physical therapy  doctor’s/specialist visits  and medical equipment that costs far more significant funds than his familys’ limited resources can currently support.Landon deserves to get the proper care so that he heals correctly and with no extra added pain. Most patients with these types of severe injuries go straight from the hospital to a medical rehabilitation facility   but that was not within our budget and is not covered by his medical help program. Unfortunately his type of care is very expensive and since his recovery is going to take so long and it will add up. The bulk costs are going to be from the first 6 months of his recovery and all the specialists he has to see  the medication costs  and his hospital bill which which will not all be covered and would fall on him to pay. He has just qualified for some reduced cost for rehab  thru a state-funded program  which will help thankfully.We are privileged to have Landon back at home now living with us  his adoring family  to help him thoroughly recover as much as possible  and as soon as possible! Unfortunately our own financial abilities do not match the love and good intentions in our breaking  but very hopeful ❤️ hearts. Landon had saved his money for a long time to come up with the $3 000 cash down payment for his 2004 (newer) used car  since his existing little old 2000 Ford Focus was at the end of its lifespan and had no A/C for a very long time either. He even sold prized possessions to come up with the down payment  which of course he has now lost all $3000 since the car was totaled. Landon had just been at a new job he really liked for two months  working as an inventory manager/vehicle porter for a local big Mazda dealership. Therefore  he did not yet have any health insurance unfortunately.Landon is a super good person and shows sincere interest in everyone he comes in contact with and loves to entertain with his incredible musical talent. Any contribution to aide in his care is very greatly appreciated! He plans to hone his music teaching skills and when he can  use this skill to begin bringing in income for himself again  in order to get a fresh start in life. Landon has also been using this time to grow closer to God through prayer and Bible study in order to continue to grow his faith and gain strength and endurance— not only for during this time  but for the future. He shares his faith freely with everyone as a volunteer minister.Thank you so very much in advance for any financial support  but also for sharing this story and link with others!!! Any shared funds will vastly help at this time  and your generosity is greatly appreciated!10-30-18UPDATE: Hospital bill is $241 491.00 — whew!

I suffered through the rest of the weekend trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and ice packs.  By Monday I was desperate for relief from the pain...I called my daughter and she came to take me to Urgent Care.  There wasn't much they could do for me without escalating the visit to an ER visit  which would 10x to 20x the cost of the visit  and with no insurance  I needed to spend my modest savings wisely.  They did a minimal exam  prescribed some pain meds and strongly suggested I see a GYN doc as soon as possible.The next day I called a GYN and scheduled an appointment for the following day.  At the appointment  the GYN did a pelvic exam and collected some tissue for biopsy.   When the doctor called me on Sunday...I knew it wasn't good news...  (I was eerily calm...I think I was in shock...  I'm not afraid to die  but I'm in no hurry to do so.   I have a lot of living still to do  places to go  things to see  people to meet  lives to touch...wonderful children to spend time with  great friends...and an amazing precious granddaughter to watch her grow into a loving  compassionate  intelligent woman who will change the world...)She recommended I see a specialist asap.  The next morning I was on the phone calling a specialist and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.  Three days later I underwent major surgery (radical full hysterectomy).  Because I had no insurance  the hospital required that I pay 50% of THEIR estimated costs up front  and sign a promissory note to pay the balance within 6 months.  That was half of my meager savings...  And that didn't include the anesthesiologist  surgeon  lab work etc...   At the post op appointment the next week...  I learned my uterus was the size of a cantaloupe when he removed it.  AND it was filled with aggressive stage 3 endometrial cancer which had started to grow through the wall of the uterus.  Yikes!!Now I'm facing chemo  radiation and more chemo every 3 weeks for the next 5 months.  Fortunately I was able to get insurance in place for 2019  which will help with most of those expenses but does nothing for the original medical expenses incurred in Nov/Dec 2018.The bills for the surgery are starting to come in and they are higher than I had expected....far beyond what I can pay on my own  especially since I'm not able to work at full speed right now...  After much encouragement from my friends...I'm swallowing my pride to ask for financial help.  No amount is too small  every amount is deeply appreciated  and anything will help...With gratitude...KarenLet's kick cancer out!!p.s.

Their lives have never been the same. Both were injured  Jeff very seriously. In attempts to repair his spinal damage  Jeff has had 9 major surgeries  10 other medical procedures  and dozens of tests. His surgeons now consider his condition inoperable  and he is on painkillers  which are largely ineffective. In 2012  Jeff was laid off from his job as a lawyer and was denied long-term care coverage that they paid for. The settlement from their car insurance company ($87 000) did not cover their financial losses—over $1 500 000—and did not offer compensation for damages. In the more than 8 years since the accident  Steph has worked full time  and Jeff has not been able to work as he had for 30 years. Steph and Jeff have struggled with home care and with paying their bills. After years of compounding stress  Jeff is now considered disabled. Steph's own health has also paid the price. She developed heart disease and has had two cardiac catheterizations with two stents. In 2018  Steph was downsized from her job as an editor and writer when her company lost major contracts  and she lost her health insurance. She continued with COBRA care coverage for 18 months  but that has ended. While she was waiting for her Virginia health insurance from the Affordable Care Act to come through  Steph found herself in the hospital for cardiac symptoms  exhaustion  and dehydration  which left them with thousands of dollars in bills.In recent months  Steph and Jeff have tried to make some life changes to ease the stress of their lives and find a home that would be less expensive and easier for them to manage  possibly in another city. They are under pressure to move  because they are currently renting and their landlord may sell their home in the hot Alexandria housing market. Their housing search in Northern Virginia and elsewhere has not gone as they had hoped  and they are in extreme distress. While they are looking for a new place to live  Jeff and Steph must also contend with medical bills  high-cost health insurance  moving costs  Steph's ongoing job search  and concerns for the future of their two beloved cats  Callie and Dorian. Jeff fell in their home last week and is recovering from a swollen right knee. Steph is not currently driving and has lost 20 pounds in 1 month. They are at their lowest low.We are asking that you donate money to give Steph and Jeff a break from some of their financial load  to help them find ways to lighten their burdens of care and stress  and to give them some glimmer of hope for a turnaround. Steph and Jeff are kind and generous people who have given their talents  money  and energy to their families  friends  neighbors  and their communities in Alexandria and in other cities for many years. In addition to volunteering with ESL students at Key School in Arlington and as adoption counselors with King Street Cats in Alexandria  they both volunteered at Alexandria's Carpenter's Shelter. At Carpenter's Jeff has done pro bono legal work with residents  and Steph was named to the Volunteer Wall of Honor in 2018 for her work helping more than 120 people over the years find work and housing. Steph and Jeff have been there for so many other people their whole lives long. They are now in dire need of the kind of love and support they have given others. Donations are one way you and yours can help. Other ways to help are to help them find a new place to live (ideally one story) in Alexandria  the DC Metro area  or possibly another city. Another is to help Steph get a new editor/writer job or freelance work.

But over the last 8 months Chris has been dealing with cognitive issues from Frontal Lobe Damage caused by neurological issues. He has cognitive/memory problems  trouble with his balance and has had many falls and spills. On December 30th  I found Chris at the bottom of the stairs. He had been unconscious. He couldn't stand on his own or complete a sentence.  He had collapsed due to a subdural bilateral hematoma.  On NYE   he had emmergency surgery to release the pressure and to drain the blood from his brain.  On Jan 2nd  Chris had his second surgery to install a tube that would better drain the blood from his brain.  Chris will be in the hospital for at least a week and approximately 2 weeks in a rehab facility.  While we do have health insurance  it will not come close to covering all of the bills.  We hate to have to ask for help but it is beyond our means to cover these medical costs.  If you are able  we would be forever grateful for any help you are able to give.   The road to recovery is going to be a long and tedious one for Chris but we hope to see this \"Cowboy\" smiling again!  We both thank you for all your support during this difficult time. ****We are blown away by the amount of support.

"Medical","March 16, 2019","Help Hubert Pinder Win His Cancer Battle","$8,565","$35,000","77","1","77","354","ACWORTH","GA","In June  2017  Green Turtle Cay’s Hubert (“Hubie”) Pinder received the news nobody wants to hear. At 72  he was diagnosed with colon cancer. Though the disease had already touched many members of his family – and taken the lives of his sister  nephew and niece – Hubert was ready and determined to fight. After surgery to remove the cancer  he began a year-long course of chemotherapy. Fortunately  his treatment was in pill form  meaning that in between his quarterly check-ups in Nassau  Hubert was able to return home to Green Turtle Cay. At the end of his treatment  Hubert received the news we had all hoped for. No sign of cancer remained. He was cured. His doctors warned  however  that there was always a chance the cancer would reappear. Six weeks ago  during Hubert’s quarterly check-up  doctors discovered that his cancer has not only returned  at an aggressive rate  but has spread to his stomach lining. So  on Monday  March 18th  he will undergo surgery to have a chemotherapy port inserted. Once the area around the port has healed  Hubert will begin a more intensive course of chemo  which may require him to remain in Nassau for extended periods of time. Unfortunately  for many Bahamians  private health insurance is prohibitively expensive. And though Hubert remains positive and upbeat  the reality is that his surgery and cancer treatment will cost him tens of thousands of dollars. To get the care he needs  he’ll need to pay out-of-pocket for doctors  nurses  x-rays  scans  chemotherapy and much more. On top of that  he’ll have expenses related to his travel to Nassau  and meals and transportation while he’s there. Due to his illness  Hubert has had to close his popular Green Turtle Cay business  Hubert’s Cuts & Curls  meaning his income has been dramatically curtailed just when he needs it most. If you know Hubert  you know how hard-working  kind and generous he is. For nearly two decades  he worked at Nassau’s Head Hunters Beauty Salon. (If you lived in Nassau between the mid-60s and the mid-80s  it’s highly likely that you or your Mom and grandmother – or as in many families  all three -- were among his extensive clientele.) Since 1985  when Hubert returned home to Green Turtle Cay and opened Hubert’s Cuts & Curls  he’s been a much-loved member of our community. Whether feeding the local stray cats  helping raise funds for the town’s annual fireworks display  or discreetly lending support to family members and friends in need  Hubert has always been there for others. And now it’s our turn to be there for him. This page has been established by Hubert’s family and friends to help pay for his treatment and expenses  and to give him the peace of mind he needs to focus all his energy on getting well. We hope you’ll help by making a donation and by sharing this page with anyone who might be able to help. And if you’re so inclined  please send up a prayer or send along positive  healing thoughts for Hubert as he faces this fight."

They believe they can handle the stress of watching their child go through major surgery  but any support that will help the parents worry less about financing this rare surgery will undoubtedly be appreciated. Knowing this family  I am sure they will be extremely grateful for any support; they are regular working people who would never ask others for money.  Unfortunately  this surgery and associated costs will most likely wipe out their savings  emergency fund  & possibly more. That’s why we wanted to set this up for them.  They don’t expect anything and will be forever grateful for any donation. Brooke recently went through her own health issues with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. She had her thyroid removed and is doing well.  So  the family has had some other recent stressors and had extensive medical expenses in 2018 as well.Any donation is greatly appreciated!  Regardless of whether you are able to donate or not please keep this family in your thoughts and prayers.Please pass this along to anyone who may not be on Facebook.  Thank you for your support for this family during this challenging time."

She had just finished the previous year with some huge wins as a stylist and couldn’t wait to start the new year off with that momentum. On Tuesday January 8th  that came to a temporary halt. She had a reaction to a medication which caused a seizure  and mini stroke. Her stroke is so rare that only 5 000 people a year get diagnosed. After over a week in the hospital being monitored  she is now on the slow road to recovery. She is expected to make a full recovery with monitoring and medications  but because her clot is very extensive it will be about 6-12 months before she is totally in the clear. She is eager to get back to her normal life of working  going to the gym  and being able to drive. As you may or may not know if you have a seizure in the state of Michigan you cannot drive for six months. So  on top of medical expenses  and continued doctors’ appointments  when family and friends aren’t available for transportation  she must use a ride sharing service  which can cost anywhere from $5-$20 per ride. On the outside  you may not realize the effects this had on Valerie. While she is still her loving  bubbly  talented self  she is also dealing with managing side effects of medications and trying her best to get back into a routine to the best her body will allow. The clot is still present so she must be extremely careful and keep the pressure down in her brain. Being the sole provider for herself  I’m sure you can imagine how challenging it is to still be making money  but at the same time having extremely reduced work hours  and limitations. We are so grateful that she is here with us and a fighter  it’s our goal to help take one of the stresses off her by helping her with some of her current financial burdens. Even with health insurance Valerie is currently looking at $10 000 in medical bills  however with continued checkups  blood draws  and monitoring  that total is likely to rise.  She is a giver both behind the chair and in everyday life. Let’s rally together and give to her in her time of need. Whatever way you can help support our girl Val it is greatly appreciated."

Her name is Lissu Orozco  a single mother  and an ovarian cancer survivor. She was diagnosed five years ago.  During this time  doctors found a 15cm (about 6 inches) tumor in her ovaries  she eventually had a complete hysterectomy  and six chemotherapy treatments which kept her home without being able to work. Despite the long and exhausting experience  tests eventually said the cancer was no longer present. Now after 5 years  my mom’s ovarian cancer has come back.During the emergency gallbladder removal from this past December doctors took a biopsy of the abnormal growth cells and sent them to the laboratory. After a few days  they would soon reveal the tests were positive for cancer. Although my mom doesn’t have her ovaries anymore  the cancer is still considered ovarian since it originated from the same source. The oncologist explained to us that it is very rare for ovarian cancer to come back and if it does it is hard or unlikely to be cured.After several studies  it has been determined that the cancer has spread across a large portion of her abdomen. She will need five treatments of chemotherapy after which doctors will conduct more studies to evaluate the progress and determine if more treatments are needed. Right now  the main objective is to do everything necessary so that the cancer enters a state of remission.The whole treatment is very expensive  and unfortunately; we don’t have the health insurance or resources necessary since we still have hospital debt from five years ago.I don’t know how things will go  but we are trying to be strong and stay positive. I really appreciate and I’m thankful for any help that allows my mom to stay here with me."

Before that happens she will be going through chemo every 2 weeks and also radiation. Today she is going under anesthesia to have a port inserted under her skin where the chemo will enter her body. Kelly's life changed in one day. Her main concern is her health but unfortunately she is in a position where money is also a concern. Kelly is a self employed business owner and her income comes from being at work and grooming as many dogs as she can each day. She works long hours to provide for her business and her 7 year old son. She has had to hire an experienced groomer to take her place so that her and her business partner can keep their business open and successful as Kelly will be unable to work while going through treatment. This obstacle along with a $5000 health insurance deductible and 20% co-insurance is overwhelming. I do not want her to feel overwhelmed by money as I want her to focus solely on her health. I know those that love her feel the same way. Kelly got her first colonoscopy soon after she turned 43. This is 7 years earlier than is recommended. Her cancer is advanced. This feels so unfair as cancer always is. We need your help. Please donate. Please pray. Please send her your loving and healing thoughts. And please get a colonoscopy."

We were happy as a family.  But those times didn’t last long because in 2016 my breast cancer Metastisized to my bones.  It fractured two vertebrae in my neck and there were spots down my spine and on my ribs.  This was devastating news because my cancer now became a Stage 4 (terminal) cancer.  However  I have too much to live for to allow this cancer to get to me.  I have had multiple radiation treatments to several areas of my body and have been going through chemo treatments weekly since my new diagnosis.  These treatments will continue for the rest of my life and are very expensive.  Already this year I have a new medical bill for several thousand dollars.  Life has changed for my family again and I just want my girls and my husband to be happy and not have to worry about money.  My husband has a great job and works very hard but as a result  we are not eligible for any financial assistance.  My family has been through so much and they support me daily. I just need to know that they are going to be ok down the road. How can I know that if I can’t ensure that now? I worry all day about money and often I am up through the night wondering how we are going to pay the bills. I should be focusing on fighting this cancer so I can continue to be here for my family.  That is much harder to do when I find myself always thinking about money and worrying... As it is  this year  expenses have increased but our income has decreased slightly due to the need for additional health insurance for me.  The constant worry is really starting to get to me.  So far  we have to be able to give our children the life that they deserve to have and I don’t want them to feel the daily worry that I have or have to sacrifice more than they already have had to do  on so many levels.  Please understand that I am grateful for everything I have and for everyone in my life and nothing will ever change that!!All along we have been doing everything we could do to keep up with the all the medical bills  personal bills and expenses and provide for our girls but the bills and expenses are becoming too much. I have always been one not to ask for help but when talking to a friend the other day  she said  “Michele  it can’t hurt to ask for help. You will never know if you don’t ask and you don’t need the added financial stress!” I thought about it and she is right. The constant worry and wonder is starting to get to me and the one thing that I do know is that this kind of stress can cause my cancer to have more power. I can’t allow that....All I want is to wake up one day without needing to figure out where the money is going to come from when my daughter asks me to get her something at the grocery store or when the request comes from school for the need to buy a ticket for a field trip.  I want to enjoy life  not take the motions to go through life.  That is what I do now and life (especially mine) is way too short for that.  The amount of worry is too great and I honestly don’t know how to fix things without asking for help.  So  Please  if it won’t hurt you to help my family  we would appreciate anything that you might be able to do to help us.  Even if it is just a $1.00 that you can spare or maybe you would be willing to share my link with your friends and family on social media  All of the above would help.  The more eyes that see my post the more of a chance I have to get back on my feet.  Thank  you is not enough but it is all I can say for now..."

It was around midnight  and the weather that night was cold and rainy  which caused Darion to lose control of the car. The vehicle hydroplaned into several trees and flipped multiple times. After arriving at Culpeper’s emergency room  doctors decided that the injuries Darion sustained were so complex and life-threatening that he had to be rushed to the University of Virginia's Trauma Center. He was not able to move nor feel his limbs below his waist and required a 5-hour surgery to fuse and stabilize his back. The diagnosis was that he suffered a complete spinal cord injury at T11. The next day  his neurologist broke the tragic news that he would only have a 5% chance of walking again. In addition to this devastating injury  Darion also sustained multiple broken ribs  bruised lungs and a broken sternum  which also required surgery. Darion is a bright and talented 23-year-old young man who had just recently gotten married to his high school sweetheart and was planning his future together with his wife before this injury would change their lives forever. Doctors gave Darion a bleak chance for a full recovery and told him he should be lucky that he is still alive. However  Darion’s strength  courage  and resolve will push him harder than ever before to ultimately walk on his own two feet again.Darion's wife and mother had to quit their jobs to assist him on his road to recovery. Darion’s family is raising funds for the ongoing medical bills and his upcoming rehab. Additionally  Darion will require expensive durable medical equipment  beyond what is covered by his health insurance  such as wheelchair-accessible transportation and other home accommodations that will help him accomplish activities of daily living (e.g.  eating  bathing  moving around) independently. 100% of the proceeds will go towards Darion’s road to recovery. Darion is known for his sincerity  kind-hardheartedness  and as someone who would not hesitate to help anyone in need. Darion now needs as much of your support as possible.  We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. May God bless you all."

Oct. 3rd  our wonderful  talented sweet 24 yr old son Landon was involved in a very serious car wreck where the driver side was crushed in by a concrete guardrail. He was knocked unconscious and badly bleeding to death internally. His best friend Trevor held him in his arms waiting for EMS personnel to arrive  keeping him alert once he gained consciousness and all the while thinking Landon might die in his arms right there. Landon had been totally crushed in between the door and the center console. Somehow with a huge burst of adrenaline he was painfully able to lift himself out of that small crushed in car area. Gratefully  no other persons were hurt in this tragic accident. Landon was actually out doing business errands on his day off  in his best suit (and there were no drugs or alcohol or reckless driving involved in the event.) Just a scary  awful  freak  automobile accident.Landon amazingly survived and was rushed to a trauma center here in Austin  Texas (at Saint David’s South Hospital) and underwent emergency surgery to repair a lacerated liver  ruptured bladder  and damaged bleeding stomach  stopping the major bleeding. He also suffered from multiple lung contusions  fractured ribs  severe bruising and other cuts from glass  as well as a tracheal hematoma. His pelvis has more fractures then you can really count  it was basically shattered. Landon was in the ICU trauma unit for a week  then moved to another recovery room for another long week. His mother Tiffany was by his side almost 24/7  the entire time  advocating for very best care & pain management for Landon while in the hospital during this excruciating crisis.Two days later after the first surgery  he went through another complicated Orthopedic surgery to put his pelvis back together with large metal screw pins. Landon has undergone a lot of severe pain  but is determined to recuperate. Thankfully we requested the help of a pain management specialist who finally got the right medication cocktail to help manage Landon’s pain without him becoming addicted to painkillers in this healing process. During one long stretch in the ICU he had 12 different tubes in different parts of his body and was on about a dozen different medications!“Landitty”  as he’s affectionately referred to by friends  has a long road ahead of him as his full recovery will take at least a year. Much of his physical rehabilitation and huge hospital bill are not covered by his community medical care program. His mother Tiffany has gladly made quick life adjustments in order to be his full-time caretaker  but she is not trained in medical rehabilitation. Landon needs ongoing physical therapy  doctor’s/specialist visits  and medical equipment that costs far more significant funds than his familys’ limited resources can currently support.Landon deserves to get the proper care so that he heals correctly and with no extra added pain. Most patients with these types of severe injuries go straight from the hospital to a medical rehabilitation facility   but that was not within our budget and is not covered by his medical help program. Unfortunately his type of care is very expensive and since his recovery is going to take so long and it will add up. The bulk costs are going to be from the first 6 months of his recovery and all the specialists he has to see  the medication costs  and his hospital bill which which will not all be covered and would fall on him to pay. He has just qualified for some reduced cost for rehab  thru a state-funded program  which will help thankfully.We are privileged to have Landon back at home now living with us  his adoring family  to help him thoroughly recover as much as possible  and as soon as possible! Unfortunately our own financial abilities do not match the love and good intentions in our breaking  but very hopeful ❤️ hearts. Landon had saved his money for a long time to come up with the $3 000 cash down payment for his 2004 (newer) used car  since his existing little old 2000 Ford Focus was at the end of its lifespan and had no A/C for a very long time either. He even sold prized possessions to come up with the down payment  which of course he has now lost all $3000 since the car was totaled. Landon had just been at a new job he really liked for two months  working as an inventory manager/vehicle porter for a local big Mazda dealership. Therefore  he did not yet have any health insurance unfortunately.Landon is a super good person and shows sincere interest in everyone he comes in contact with and loves to entertain with his incredible musical talent. Any contribution to aide in his care is very greatly appreciated! He plans to hone his music teaching skills and when he can  use this skill to begin bringing in income for himself again  in order to get a fresh start in life. Landon has also been using this time to grow closer to God through prayer and Bible study in order to continue to grow his faith and gain strength and endurance— not only for during this time  but for the future. He shares his faith freely with everyone as a volunteer minister.Thank you so very much in advance for any financial support  but also for sharing this story and link with others!!! Any shared funds will vastly help at this time  and your generosity is greatly appreciated!10-30-18UPDATE: Hospital bill is $241 491.00 — whew!

I suffered through the rest of the weekend trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and ice packs.  By Monday I was desperate for relief from the pain...I called my daughter and she came to take me to Urgent Care.  There wasn't much they could do for me without escalating the visit to an ER visit  which would 10x to 20x the cost of the visit  and with no insurance  I needed to spend my modest savings wisely.  They did a minimal exam  prescribed some pain meds and strongly suggested I see a GYN doc as soon as possible.The next day I called a GYN and scheduled an appointment for the following day.  At the appointment  the GYN did a pelvic exam and collected some tissue for biopsy.   When the doctor called me on Sunday...I knew it wasn't good news...  (I was eerily calm...I think I was in shock...  I'm not afraid to die  but I'm in no hurry to do so.   I have a lot of living still to do  places to go  things to see  people to meet  lives to touch...wonderful children to spend time with  great friends...and an amazing precious granddaughter to watch her grow into a loving  compassionate  intelligent woman who will change the world...)She recommended I see a specialist asap.  The next morning I was on the phone calling a specialist and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.  Three days later I underwent major surgery (radical full hysterectomy).  Because I had no insurance  the hospital required that I pay 50% of THEIR estimated costs up front  and sign a promissory note to pay the balance within 6 months.  That was half of my meager savings...  And that didn't include the anesthesiologist  surgeon  lab work etc...   At the post op appointment the next week...  I learned my uterus was the size of a cantaloupe when he removed it.  AND it was filled with aggressive stage 3 endometrial cancer which had started to grow through the wall of the uterus.  Yikes!!Now I'm facing chemo  radiation and more chemo every 3 weeks for the next 5 months.  Fortunately I was able to get insurance in place for 2019  which will help with most of those expenses but does nothing for the original medical expenses incurred in Nov/Dec 2018.The bills for the surgery are starting to come in and they are higher than I had expected....far beyond what I can pay on my own  especially since I'm not able to work at full speed right now...  After much encouragement from my friends...I'm swallowing my pride to ask for financial help.  No amount is too small  every amount is deeply appreciated  and anything will help...With gratitude...KarenLet's kick cancer out!!p.s.

Their lives have never been the same. Both were injured  Jeff very seriously. In attempts to repair his spinal damage  Jeff has had 9 major surgeries  10 other medical procedures  and dozens of tests. His surgeons now consider his condition inoperable  and he is on painkillers  which are largely ineffective. In 2012  Jeff was laid off from his job as a lawyer and was denied long-term care coverage that they paid for. The settlement from their car insurance company ($87 000) did not cover their financial losses—over $1 500 000—and did not offer compensation for damages. In the more than 8 years since the accident  Steph has worked full time  and Jeff has not been able to work as he had for 30 years. Steph and Jeff have struggled with home care and with paying their bills. After years of compounding stress  Jeff is now considered disabled. Steph's own health has also paid the price. She developed heart disease and has had two cardiac catheterizations with two stents. In 2018  Steph was downsized from her job as an editor and writer when her company lost major contracts  and she lost her health insurance. She continued with COBRA care coverage for 18 months  but that has ended. While she was waiting for her Virginia health insurance from the Affordable Care Act to come through  Steph found herself in the hospital for cardiac symptoms  exhaustion  and dehydration  which left them with thousands of dollars in bills.In recent months  Steph and Jeff have tried to make some life changes to ease the stress of their lives and find a home that would be less expensive and easier for them to manage  possibly in another city. They are under pressure to move  because they are currently renting and their landlord may sell their home in the hot Alexandria housing market. Their housing search in Northern Virginia and elsewhere has not gone as they had hoped  and they are in extreme distress. While they are looking for a new place to live  Jeff and Steph must also contend with medical bills  high-cost health insurance  moving costs  Steph's ongoing job search  and concerns for the future of their two beloved cats  Callie and Dorian. Jeff fell in their home last week and is recovering from a swollen right knee. Steph is not currently driving and has lost 20 pounds in 1 month. They are at their lowest low.We are asking that you donate money to give Steph and Jeff a break from some of their financial load  to help them find ways to lighten their burdens of care and stress  and to give them some glimmer of hope for a turnaround. Steph and Jeff are kind and generous people who have given their talents  money  and energy to their families  friends  neighbors  and their communities in Alexandria and in other cities for many years. In addition to volunteering with ESL students at Key School in Arlington and as adoption counselors with King Street Cats in Alexandria  they both volunteered at Alexandria's Carpenter's Shelter. At Carpenter's Jeff has done pro bono legal work with residents  and Steph was named to the Volunteer Wall of Honor in 2018 for her work helping more than 120 people over the years find work and housing. Steph and Jeff have been there for so many other people their whole lives long. They are now in dire need of the kind of love and support they have given others. Donations are one way you and yours can help. Other ways to help are to help them find a new place to live (ideally one story) in Alexandria  the DC Metro area  or possibly another city. Another is to help Steph get a new editor/writer job or freelance work. And please  never  ever text and drive. On behalf of Steph and Jeff and their loved ones  thank you.Rebecca Krafft and Sydney Baily"

He has had a total of 8 surgeries on his eyes to try to prevent further vision loss and blindness. Two of those surgeries occurred last year. He has to have costly injections in his eyes regularly ($1 500 per eye every 2-3 months) and has not been able to drive for many months. Because of his vision problems he is no longer able to work. Even with the best specialists available  they are still unable to determine what is causing continual damage to his optic nerves and continuing to cause permanent vision loss.Judy works full-time and is their primary financial provider and only driver. In May  Jon was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.In June  Judy was diagnosed with Breast Cancer.In August  Jon underwent prostate removal surgery.Judy’s cancer is aggressive  and she started on chemo right away. She just completed her last round of chemo  and she is scheduled for surgery in November. After surgery  she will begin radiation for 5-6 weeks. Following radiation she will continue with very costly ($4800/per treatment) targeted drug therapy every 3 weeks for about another year. Thankfully they do have medical insurance  but even with that they have exhausted all of their savings with out of pocket costs and expenses.  Judy has continued to work full time even through cancer treatment. It is necessary in order for them to have income and also to maintain health insurance.  They live a modest lifestyle within their financial means  and as they look toward the New Year they recognize that their portion of patient responsibility for insurance will be reset and they will need to quickly be able to come up with enough money to pay deductibles and make co-payments for their necessary treatments.They would wholeheartedly agree that the most powerful way we can support them is through prayer!

Like the truck stop  it’s part of the Fort Hall Reservation in southeastern Idaho.Amos Phillips sustained broken facial bones and a brain injury while parked at a small truck stop on an Idaho reservation.Phillips recalled that the doors of his 2000 Freightliner Century Class were locked as he slept  but an intruder “grabbed hold of the handle and just ripped it open.” After entering through the passenger door  the intruder demanded money.“I said I did not have any ” Phillips said. “He said either give me money or I’ll mess you up real bad.” As the two began to scuffle in the sleeper  the assailant  with rocks in both hands  pounded Phillips’ head.“At one point I had him in a headlock around his neck ” using his legs  Phillips said. “I took my fingers and tried to get to his eyes  but I don’t know if I did or not. It was dark. Then I squeezed his balls. Then I turned him loose with my legs  took both feet and shoved him to the front of the truck and he fell out the door.”The intruder ran away. He took nothing  but left what could be a critical piece of evidence: his cap.Phillips was hospitalized for a few days. Both cheeks and his nose were broken  and he had stitches. Most seriously  he had hematoma – a blood clot – on his brain.His son Erik Phillips brought him home to Camdenton. “A few days later  I started having convulsions  or seizures  because of the head trauma ” Amos Phillips said. He spent four days in a hospital in Osage Beach  Missouri. He’s not sure when he’ll be cleared to resume driving.Fort Hall Police Detective Brandon Tuia said Tuesday he expects the assailant’s cap to be sent to the state’s forensics lab this week for testing for hair and sweat. Unlike simpler forensics analysis  such as fingerprints  with DNA testing “it might take months to get the results ” he said.Unless the suspect has a prior arrest that led to his DNA being entered in a criminal database  there will be no match to help in Phillips’ case. He said he has no estimate of age or other identifying features of the assailant other than he appeared to be Native American.U.S. Attorney Jack Haycock of Idaho will determine whether the case goes to federal authorities or the tribal court. When a suspect is Native American  a case can go to both jurisdictions without it being considered double jeopardy  Tuia said.He says it likely will become a federal case  based on its severity and the assumption that the suspect is Native American  whether proven by DNA or based on Phillips’ word until proven otherwise.Phillips and John Williams  owner of JWE  said they’re frustrated at the slow progress of the investigation.“They seemed to be very aggressive at first ” Williams recalled. “Then it seemed like they did back off a bit. I was calling every day.”Williams said he keeps forward-facing cameras in his trucks that run even when the trucks are parked  but Phillips’ attacker approached from the truck’s rear and exited the same way. The intruder’s approach and exit were caught on a truck stop security camera  but the images aren’t clear enough to help  said Stephanie Afraidofbear  interim manager of the truck stop.The truck stop’s overnight security guard  who mostly monitors activity inside the convenience store  did not witness the incident  she says. The truck stop  run by the tribe as a Phillips 66 franchise  has about 10 truck parking places  she said.Williams said the driver who was sent to retrieve the truck found blood-stained rocks inside and a mattress so bloodied it had to be thrown away.Phillips said he’s concerned about paying for his medical bills because has no health insurance. He is the sole provider for his household  which also includes his wife and her two children  who are in high school.At Phillips’ request  Williams said he’s tried to hire an attorney  but the two he’s called have referred him elsewhere."

In 2016  he was forced to give up the sport he loves so much due to complications stemming from what doctors diagnosed as traumatic brain injury (TBI)  likely acquired from the many matches he participated in.On Tuesday  January 29  2019  Peter went to see his doctor who had previously treated him after his retirement. His blood was taken and he was told to await the results. Shortly upon returning home  his doctor called him and ordered him to immediately go to the emergency room for more invasive testing. I took him to HCMC in downtown Minneapolis where he was then hospitalized for nearly two weeks. He was found to have a bacterial staph infection in his bloodstream that was comprising the effectiveness of several of his organs. Prior to his release he was given a PICC line where he has to inject four different medicines  three times a day  along with 8 other daily oral medications. He’s already missed one month of work and will likely need to miss more. He does have health insurance that will cover some of his medical bills  but other bills are mounting due to his inability to go do his job. All funds raised from the generosity of those who can contribute will be allocated for medical expenses  and other bills in general so he can avoid being forced out of his home while being out of work. This is genuinely a case where literally anything will help and 100% of proceeds will go to aiding Peter in getting back to full health.

Thank you for reading and for your help!My daughter Darya (Dasha) lives in my home country of Belarus. This is where she was exposed to Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe two month after her birth in 1986…In 2013  she was diagnosed with primary Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma  nasopharynx  T4N0M0. In 2013-14  Darya received primary treatment: part of the tumor was resected surgically  the unresectable part was treated with chemo and radiation therapies.In 2016-17  a local recurrence  totally unresecectable  was discovered and treated with radiation therapy (Gamma Knife). However  later the tumor came back: In December 2018  unrelated local recurrence in two locations  upper nasopharynx and hearing tube through the ear  both on the right side  were discovered  both found unresectable. This time  the only treatment available is stereo-tactic radiation therapy which includes a very high risk procedure due to the tumor proximity to critical structures  and the accumulated effect of two prior radiation treatments. This treatment has been deemed technically impossible in clinics where she received her all previous treatment in Belarus and Russia.  The only clinic which has agreed to treat in this case is a UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston  TX). The risk increases with the tumor growths i.e. with time since the recurrent tumor has been diagnosed and hence requires urgent treatment with high-precision radiation therapy  the only option available in this case. Finally  I was able to bring Darya to America and start the radiation therapy treatment in Houston in February 2019. This is the last chance for us and we really hope for the best!Her disease left her unemployed and with no funds. While living in the US I could not add her to my health insurance since she is a foreigner. So I ended up paying the full cost to UT MDACC (currently  about $ 104 000  actual charges already exceeded MDACC estimate shown below) and all associated costs (international travel  living  domestic consultations)  total to 115 K$  out of my pocket. Although I have a job I did not have such funds available even after taking my retirement funds and loaning from my friends and colleagues. Hence “GoFundMe” appears to be our last resort to complete Darya's treatment she has just started. Thank you for your consideration and help!!!Dmitri LapotkoP.S.

"Medical","March 12, 2019","Support Chucky Buckets","$8,055","$48,000","59","1","60","55","ANNARBOR","MI","To know Chuck is to love Chuck.Anyone who has met my dad would agree that he is a fiercely loyal man. He is as loyal to his family  friends  and pets as he is to his sports teams and beer choices. His devotion to his family became more evident than ever 5 years ago when my mom suffered a massive brain aneurysm that changed us forever. At the time  she was 64 years old and in seemingly great health. She went from working full time to fighting for her life. From finding her unresponsive  to months in the ICU  to multiple nursing homes  every single day of the past 5 years has been a battle for her and for our family. (Her story was captured here:  www.welovebonnie.weebly.com .) While many men may have become distant from their wives or families after such a catastrophic event  my dad grew more committed to caring for his wife  my sister  and me. When many of his 65 year old retired friends were golfing and traveling  he was spending his days in the nursing home with our mom. He took this role seriously and was committed full time (seriously... he was at the nursing home from 9am to 5pm  every.single.day.). His positive attitude  nonstop jokes  and unwavering love continue to be a bright light in the darkest moments. With our parents residing in our hometown of Goshen  Indiana  my sister in Denver  and me in Chicago  the distance soon become too much to manage. After three years of flights and long-distance care-taking  we knew we needed to move our aging parents closer to one of us. With me moving to Ann Arbor  there was absolutely no way Chuck (who had been chanting Go Irish his whole life) was ever going to step foot near the Big House (there would be no Go Blue in his future) With Michigan out of the picture and Dad on board with the idea of spending his golden years in Denver (read: Golden Years near Golden  Colorado... eh-hem... home to Coors Brewery)  we began the process of selling our childhood home. In the fall of 2017  my sister  our parents  their two cats  and I took a oneway flight to Denver. Within a few short weeks  my mom had moved into a Denver nursing home  my sister had married her husband  James  and they had turned their basement into a \"Poppy Pad\" for our dad. Just when we were all beginning to feel settled into to our new normal  our dad was diagnosed with advanced Stage 4 prostate cancer. This shook us to the core. How had the doctors in Indiana missed this? How could it be that this amazing father and husband  who had committed to spending every single day of his retirement in a nursing home caring for his sick wife  would now have to fight for HIS life? \"The Golden Years\" in Colorado quickly took a turn for the worse  and I truly cannot begin to put into words the physical and mental toll all of this has taken on my sister and me. One sick parent was heartbreaking; two sick parents has become excruciating. For the past year  I've gone through the motions  trying my best to help out from twelve-hundred miles away. I call Acreedo to order my dad’s Xtandi cancer medication  check in on him to make sure he had taken said medication  login to his MyChart to review the latest test results/appointment schedule  and then hear from my sister how difficult everything is... ::Mom doesn’t remember where she is. Dad hasn’t eaten today. We need to file for Medicaid again. Mom fell out of bed. Meals on Wheels is coming  can you remind Dad to answer the door? Dad is in the ER. He can't stop vomiting. Chemo isn't working. Dad's labs don't looik good. The cancer has spread.:: Doctors. Nurses. Scans. Vitals. Health Insurance. Bills. Medicaid. Repeat.Now and again  I forget this new normal isn’t actually normal. Most of my friends aren’t taking care of their parents. In fact  most of my friends’ parents are watching their babies. Sometimes I wonder what that would be like. Sometimes I get so mad. Sometimes I break down crying. And now that I have a baby of my own  sometimes I worry about her having to take care of me one day. And while all of this is hard on me  I can only begin to fathom the toll it is taking on my sister and her husband.When Sara and James selflessly moved our parents across the country and turned their basement into an apartment for our dad  he was a generally healthy and vibrant retired man in his mid-sixties. So while they anticipated caring for our mom right away  they were not prepared to become full time caretakers for two parents  only a week after their wedding. When they were supposed to be living in wedded bliss  they postponed their honeymoon and began meeting with oncologists about what was supposed to just be a \"swollen lymph node\". The past year has been an emotional rollercoaster  with recent weeks taking the cake for being the hardest yet.2019 hasn't been easy on our dad  with more time in the hospital than not. When he is discharged  hopefully this week  he will be released to a rehab facility for OT and PT. While we will continue to pray for his health to improve and him to be able to move back into the Poppy Pad  it may be too unsafe for him to ever return home. Between the stairs in the apartment  the support he needs walking  bathing  using the restroom  eating  and his memory and cognition  the risks may always be too high. On top of this  his oncologist has shared her concern that his body is no longer responding to treatment. If our dad does need to move into a skilled nursing facility  the cost will be at least $8 000 a month. With our mom already on Medicaid  we are hoping to preserve some of my parent's estate to support our mom when our dad is no longer with us. We are seeking support to raise funding for 6 months in a skilled nursing facility.They say it takes a village  and that's true of my family. I want to honor my dad  Chuck  for taking care of my mom for all of the years he was healthy and able; his dedication to his marriage has set the bar high for my own. I also want to honor and thank him for his positive spirit. His ability to see the positive in everything is something that carries me through hard days. I want to honor my sister  Sara  for putting herself second and our parents first. On top managing the physical health of both of our parents  she spends her \"spare\" time making sure they are happy. From researching Dementia games  doing crafts and eating lunch with our mom to spending the Super Bowl in the ER and treating our dad to a Bob Segar concert  she never lets their illnesses stop them from living. And I want to honor my brother-in-law  James  and his mom  Lynn  for caring for my dad like they would their own family. They didn't sign up for this  and their loyalty to our family has touched my soul.It is with the most humble of hearts we turn to friends and family in hopes of alleviating part of this financial stress so we can focus on treatment and healing. Your thoughts  prayers and generous donations are sincerely appreciated."

This then included a bout of pneumonia shortly after that. He was treated at a private clinic and seemed to be getting better but recently he started complaining of more symptoms and as of yesterday he had to be admitted to ICU at the Princes Margaret Hospital in Nassau. Originally he was to have surgery to remove his gall bladder as he had stopped eating and drinking anything for days due to discomfort but because of his current heart condition he won't be able to have surgery until that condition improves. After a series of tests and scans we found out that most of his organs were shutting down putting him in critical care.He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit with a combination of kidney failure and congestive heart failure. His family are with him constantly. As some of you know  because Ramon is deaf  communication is difficult with nurses and doctors who don't use sign language so family members stay with him when allowed to make sure he is understood and not afraid. As of yesterday however he was sedated and recently was put on dialysis to try and restore kidney function. Currently he is not breathing on his own but we are hopeful that this will change over the next few days. We are reaching out because Ramon has no medical insurance to help cover the very expensive stay in the ICU and the continued treatment that will be necessary for the unforeseen future. While we as a family are able to dig in to help we are aware that the hospital stay  doctors and nurses care and medication will need to continue as the hospital works to keep Ramon alive and hopefully functioning on his own. This is his first time in a hospital at the age of 58. We want to ensure the best care possible for him with hopes that he will pull through this time and continue to be with us in the future. At the moment we don't know what is down the road in terms of continued care but we will keep updates coming as we know more. I am Derek Burrows  brother of Ramon. Originally from Nassau where Ramon lives I live now between Mexico and Nassau and occasionally in the US. The funding of this project goes completely to the hospital costs for Ramon's ICU stay and if enough are raised then to his continued care. ICU costs are above $2000 a day and Ramon has spent 16 days in the ICU until he was finally allowed to leave. Other costs include medication and he has  lot of medications to take daily for the rest of his life.  Doctor's visits which are frequent also add a hefty additional cost and as he has no health insurance the costs continue to rise. Ramon  was our father's constant companion  working with him for many years. We would be forever grateful for any help to insure that Ramon gets better and continues a long life ahead.Every prayer  every dollar  every gesture of support is greatly appreciated.With love and gratitudeThe Burrows Family"

As Scott and family was preparing for discharge  Scott stopped breathing  having an episode of apnea. He was quickly stimulated and resumed breathing again; however  after a brief examination it was decided Scott would be admitted to the NICU for observation. Once he was moved to the NICU Scott had another few episodes of apnea and they consequently had to put in a breathing tube.– Scott and his Brother  Liam  at birth  May 2018. –The medical team began running tests and it was quickly revealed by MRI of his brain that Scott had a very large stroke on the left side of his brain. He was placed on a 24 hr video EEG which determined that the stroke had caused Scott to have seizures which were presenting as the episodes of apnea. After several rounds of different medications the seizures were finally stopped  allowing Scott to come off the ventilator. Scott spent 2 weeks in the NICU before being released home.  After coming home  and despite being closely followed by many doctors  Scott had a relatively normal first few months of life getting to know his older brother  parents  and grand parents. It wasn't until his second follow up EEG that Scott was diagnosed with a new type of seizure  called infantile spasms. Scott was immediately placed on a harsh regiment of drugs to try to get the seizures under control.– Scott's first introduction to Mrs. Clause  December 2018. –Over the first year of Scott's life we have seen countless medical visits and consults. Scott's seizures were bought under control with drugs until December 2018 when they returned. Although through the addition of more medications we have been able to keep the seizures at bay and reduce them significantly  it is clear that a medical solution is not possible in the long term. – Scott eating some banana while under going a 24 video EEG at Upstate Children's Hospital  January 2019. –After a visit to Boston's Children's Hospital in February  it was determined that the best course of action and treatment for Scott's condition was to perform a Hemispherectomy. A Hemispherectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is disconnected to prevent the damaged side from interfering with the development and function of healthy side. After undergoing more evaluations and tests Scott's surgery has been scheduled for April 2019.– Scott and Mommy preparing for the baby MEG at Boston's Children's Hospital  March 2019. –Through Kayla's employment as a resident at Upstate Hospital in Syracuse  NY  the family has been blessed with a good health insurance plan which has covered a good portion of Scott's medical bills. However the deductibles  co-pays  travel costs  and incidentals have begun to add up and the family is asking for any help that might be available from family and friends.We ask  if you have the ability  that you might consider a small donation that would be used to help pay for Scott's Doctor's visits  medications  therapies and getting him to and from the various hospitals and appointments.

As Scott and family was preparing for discharge  Scott stopped breathing  having an episode of apnea. He was quickly stimulated and resumed breathing again; however  after a brief examination it was decided Scott would be admitted to the NICU for observation. Once he was moved to the NICU Scott had another few episodes of apnea and they consequently had to put in a breathing tube.– Scott and his Brother  Liam  at birth  May 2018. –The medical team began running tests and it was quickly revealed by MRI of his brain that Scott had a very large stroke on the left side of his brain. He was placed on a 24 hr video EEG which determined that the stroke had caused Scott to have seizures which were presenting as the episodes of apnea. After several rounds of different medications the seizures were finally stopped  allowing Scott to come off the ventilator. Scott spent 2 weeks in the NICU before being released home.  After coming home  and despite being closely followed by many doctors  Scott had a relatively normal first few months of life getting to know his older brother  parents  and grand parents. It wasn't until his second follow up EEG that Scott was diagnosed with a new type of seizure  called infantile spasms. Scott was immediately placed on a harsh regiment of drugs to try to get the seizures under control.– Scott's first introduction to Mrs. Clause  December 2018. –Over the first year of Scott's life we have seen countless medical visits and consults. Scott's seizures were bought under control with drugs until December 2018 when they returned. Although through the addition of more medications we have been able to keep the seizures at bay and reduce them significantly  it is clear that a medical solution is not possible in the long term. – Scott eating some banana while under going a 24 video EEG at Upstate Children's Hospital  January 2019. –After a visit to Boston's Children's Hospital in February  it was determined that the best course of action and treatment for Scott's condition was to perform a Hemispherectomy. A Hemispherectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is disconnected to prevent the damaged side from interfering with the development and function of healthy side. After undergoing more evaluations and tests Scott's surgery has been scheduled for April 2019.– Scott and Mommy preparing for the baby MEG at Boston's Children's Hospital  March 2019. –Through Kayla's employment as a resident at Upstate Hospital in Syracuse  NY  the family has been blessed with a good health insurance plan which has covered a good portion of Scott's medical bills. However the deductibles  co-pays  travel costs  and incidentals have begun to add up and the family is asking for any help that might be available from family and friends.We ask  if you have the ability  that you might consider a small donation that would be used to help pay for Scott's Doctor's visits  medications  therapies and getting him to and from the various hospitals and appointments.

My name is Addi Steinert  and I’m creating this page on behalf of my mom  Becki Steinert  to share her story. In one moment a person’s life can change! My family’s and  most of all my mom’s   did the day we found out she has lung cancer. It all started just a little over a month ago. My mom started having a minor pain in her lung. This prompted a doctor visit to Cass Lake over the holidays  where a lesion on her right lung was discovered. This required a biopsy for suspected lung cancer. The biopsy was positive and confirmed by a follow-up appointment with Dr. Jerry Johnson at St. Luke’s in Duluth on January 10th. The diagnosis: small cell lung cancer.  For those of you who aren’t familiar  small cell lung cancer is an aggressive type of cancer that is not the type of cancer that can be cut out surgically. Unfortunately  the only treatment is advanced chemotherapies. Since the diagnosis   it’s been scheduling MRI’s and PET scans to figure out the severity of the illness. Thank God  the MRI on Mom’s brain confirmed the cancer has not spread there! Great news! But we have a long battle ahead of us. We currently are working on obtaining health insurance to help with the medical expenses  but  as of now  she doesn’t have it. We know there will be many trips back and forth to Duluth for treatment and doctor appointments. My mom is a fighter  and we have faith  but the cost of treatment and expenses has caused a lot of stress. My family and I graciously ask for any support you can offer to help a woman who would give the shirt off her back to help someone in need as she fights the big fight! We are grateful for any donation.  Thank you and God Bless!"

After a recent surgery failed to resolve his heart issues his doctors advised that a heart transplant is necessary for him to have any quality of life. The funds raised will go toward medical  travel  and housing expenses.Full details of Fernando’s health journey: In 1989  at the age of 19  Fernando was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma. Aggressive chemotherapy & radiation treatments led to the destruction of his heart. He was in remission until 1993 when the same form of cancer returned. From 1993 through 2004 Fernando had period of good health where he was able to enjoy life.  However in 2004 he started not feeling well and was in & out of the hospital for a couple years.  In 2006 he was diagnosed with heart disease and had an emergency triple bypass. He was in the hospital for over a month. He was released only to return 3 days later and was diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation and needed a pacemaker. Ever since then  Fernando had numerous doctor appointments  ER visits  and hospital stays. This past year  2018  he was battling fluid retention and his doctors had not pinpointed a cause. His health has been in a downward spiral.  In November 2018 he was told that he needed tricuspid valve replacement because the pacemaker lead penetrated the tricuspid valve.  His doctors hoped that the valve replacement would increase Fernando's quality of life. Finally on January 14th  2019 he had surgery to replace the tricuspid valve.  additional pacemaker work done due to the previous valve surgery damage. After being released from the hospital  Fernando was re-admitted February 1st. Doctors had determined that his heart failure was more advanced than anticipated and the surgery did not provide any relief.   Fernando has been denied Short Term Disability due to pre-existing health conditions.  Since he is not able to work he is on an unpaid leave of absence and unable to pay for health insurance. Fernando's wife  Jennifer  has been on disability since 2000 due to her own battles with cancer and epilepsy. She is unable to work to contribute to the financial needs of the family. The constant stream of medical costs over the years has been devastating to the family and our hope is that this fundraiser will provide the Armijo Family with resources necessary to pay the costs associated with medical expenses (hospital  heart transplant  prescriptions  occupational/physical/cardiac/speech therapy  and a home health nurse) as well as travel and housing expenses. Any contributions are greatly appreciated! We know that the Armijo Family  which includes his wife and 2 sons  will be truly grateful for the help in their time of need."

"Medical","December 15, 2018","Help Dee Survive &amp; Thrive - Diedra Brooks Lanphear","$7,650","$45,000","77","4","70","330","DURHAM","NC","We are raising funds for my wife Diedra to continue pursuing alternative treatments against her stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer. These treatments have been and will continue to be instrumental to her survival  but are not covered by health insurance. Dee  as she is known to many  is really struggling right now and has been battling her ovarian cancer and it's recurrences since 2005. Dee is a joyful person who loves and embraces life. Dee is a spiritual person  a person of faith  ever optimistic and cheerful  and always lifts up and lends a hand to others. She is the sweetest person with the sweetest soul I have ever met. People that meet her often comment that she is a ray of sunshine that lights up the room she is in. Dee is a voracious reader and has done much research on her illness and has employed many natural and alternative therapies in addition to conventional medicine. Now she must re-double her efforts as the cancer that has recurred for the fourth time is inoperable  has and will require more and ongoing alternative therapies to shrink and eradicate it.  Dee's first diagnosis and major surgery were at Christmas in 2005. Since conventional chemotherapy and radiation were not proven effective against Dee's particular clear cell cancer  she sought both conventional and alternative treatment at Dr. James Forsythe's integrative oncology practice in Reno  Nevada in 2006. Dee was six years removed from that initial diagnosis  surgery  and treatment  when in early 2012 during her career as an international flight attendant with American Airlines  she became ill in London soon after working a trip from her beloved New York City base. After days of being too ill to travel and being confined to her hotel bed in London  she was finally able to fly as a passenger and return to our home in Durham  North Carolina. Unfortunately  tests revealed the severity of her illness  that being a mass in her abdomen that had perforated her colon and caused an infection and internal bleeding. In March of 2012 after five hours of surgery  the mass and a portion of her colon and small intestine were removed and it was diagnosed as a Stage IV recurrence of her ovarian cancer. Needless to say after a leave of absence she had to medically retire as the cancer precluded her return to flying and working. She returned to Dr. Forsythe in Reno  we invested in expensive but extensive testing to identify the most effective treatments to her particular cancer and we employed those therapies designed to build her immune system to combat any random cancer cells left behind from the surgery. Unfortunately and more than three years later in the fall of 2015  symptoms and a CT scan revealed a 2nd recurrence of her ovarian cancer in the form of another abdominal mass. Two weeks after receiving and amidst processing this news  Dee slipped and fell breaking her right arm at the shoulder. Dee was incapacitated without the use of her dominant arm for some months while determining the best course of action to deal with this 2nd recurrence. Having met and befriended members of a foundation for healing from Basel  Switzerland  on our return to New York during our last vacation in May of 2015  Dee pursued the alternative treatment suggested in hopes of building her immune system to fight the cancer and to shrink the mass. She traveled in January of 2016 to a clinic on the Baltic sea in Travemunde  Germany and received three weeks of intensive treatments via the clinic doctor and other members of the healing team. It was also unfortunate that my father  Dee's father-in-law (whom we cared for since the passing of my mother from glioblastoma cancer of the brain in 2006) was diagnosed with terminal lung and bladder cancer shortly thereafter. Our care for him precluded our complete focus on Dee's health  as his surgeries and hospitalizations both preceded and followed Dee's hospitalization and her very complicated and delicate six and a half hours of surgery to remove the mass and more of her bowel in September of 2016. The surgery was performed by Dr. Karyn Stitzenberg of the Lineberger Cancer Center at UNC Medical Center - Chapel Hill.After my father's passing in 2017  Dee's CT scan just before Thanksgiving in November of last year revealed a new abdominal mass. Dr. Stitzenberg again performed a complicated surgery to remove the mass and a portion of her duodenum and stomach that the tumor had attached to. Unfortunately  Dee had to spend another Christmas in the hospital and a longer recovery time  but we were grateful for another successful surgery.A CT scan at the end of July this year indicates that another mass has formed and it's proximity to vital organs and vessels precludes surgery. That was a shock but despite being inoperable  Dee as always is steadfast  resolute and optimistic she can beat this and shrink this tumor via alternative treatments. After experiencing severe abdominal pain resulting in a trip to the ER in August  another CT scan showed the mass was growing   compressing her stomach and bowels and causing a partial bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the hospital. Following her release  having already researched and with a trusted friend's recommendation and first hand account of numerous success stories with cancer treatment  Dee went to Bavaria in September for three weeks of intensive treatments and infusions (highlighted by local thermotherapy treatments to the area of the cancer  as described on the clinic's website) with Dr. Alex Weber at the private in-patient clinic for integrative medicine   www.klinik-marinus.com . Dee stayed for the fourth week of treatment as ultrasounds indicated the hyperthermia treatments were arresting the growth of her mass and the clinic provides such a healing environment  as is evidenced by accessing the link to their website above. Dee was too weak to climb stairs when she arrived at the clinic  but by the third week was walking daily on the paths in the meadows around the clinic and was even well enough to do some sight-seeing in nearby Kufstein and Salzburg  Austria at the end of her stay. Although we bought out Dee's retirement to fund a majority portion of the approximately $24 000 cost of the initial four weeks of treatment at the clinic  we used a credit card to pay the balance upon leaving the clinic after her last day of treatment on October 15th. Many of the clinic's patients return time and again for the beneficial \"maintenance\" of the treatments. It was like night and day for how Dee looked and felt from arrival to departure from the clinic. We always envisioned her returning at some point next year  but are now considering a return as early as January 7th. After six weeks of renewed vibrancy being home from the clinic  Dee experienced complications  namely acute nausea and vomiting causing pronounced weight loss and weakness. A recent CT scan and cancer markers in her blood work preceding a hospital stay again last month indicated the mass has started to grow again and is further compressing her stomach and bowels. Dee was readmitted to the hospital again last week after renewed nausea and other complications were attributed to hypercalcemia  an elevated level of calcium in her blood. After treatment for dehydration and the hypercalcemia  Dee was able to keep soft foods and liquids down again and was released from the hospital on Saturday. We are now formulating our plan of attack to stabilize Dee's symptoms and to stop and shrink the mass. By employing the diet and nutrition plans of the likes of Chris Wark and Dr. Schultz  and by pursuing any and every measure of alternative treatments locally  such as vitamin and mineral infusions and ozone therapy  we hope to rebuild Dee's strength to allow a return to the healing environs of the Klinik Marinus am Stein in Germany in the New Year! Hopefully like below  she will be able to play hymns on the piano in the dining room for her fellow patients again in 2019! Although we have been reluctant to this point to ask for  expect or accept any help other than the continued prayers  well wishes and the positive words of encouragement that lift Dee up...any donations will help to defray some of the costs of the treatments she has already received and perhaps will help Dee to be able to pursue the additional and ongoing alternative treatments she will need moving forward!Thank you for your encouragement and support of our darling Dee!           May God Bless You!  Brad Lanphear"

To many  it is the name of their genuine  immensely-thoughtful and fun friend who has experienced many setbacks in her lifetime but still manages to keep a smile on her face through them all. To others  it means sister  daughter  or fiancée.In 2016  after months of doctors visits and not being able to work in the garage  Sofi was diagnosed with and treated for an autoimmune disease called ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the nature of the disease  she was unable to absorb any nutrients from the food that she consumed and could not function for more than 10 minutes at a time without feeling the need to pass out  while also dealing with constant excruciating abdominal pain. Any time she has a flare up  this causes her to be laid up in bed for months and takes a couple more month to gain her strength and stamina back. Although she is currently in remission  she still experiences significant relapses in periods of high stress and is required to take medication for the rest of her life  while still being constantly threatened by an increased risk of colon cancer or the eventual need for one of many surgical procedures to remove her colon entirely.Stem cell transplant therapy has been identified as an effective method of improving the quality of life of people with UC and reducing many of the aforementioned risks. Due to regulations in the US on such treatments  Sofi is forced to explore options outside of the country that are not covered by health insurance. This amounts to an approximate out-of-pocket cost of nearly $30 000.Though she is always donating thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars for charity  Sofi has never once asked for help with her own mishaps  so we think it is time for us to step up and help her. She will be immensely grateful for every little bit that you are able to provide!"

She was scheduled for an appointment on 12/18 with a surgeon at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle to discuss surgery. In the past few days pain has increased a lot and it seems to have progressed a lot for the worse  so we are hoping they will schedule the surgery for as soon as possible. We will post updates here as we know more.Help With ExpensesObviously Nancy is not able to work during this time and it will likely be a lengthy process. She has health insurance and we are still waiting to find out what exactly it will pay for or not. In any case  the expenses will rack up and will likely be in the many thousands. If you know Nancy  you know that while she has never had much  she has always given to others freely. She is not currently set up with savings to handle a situation like this. As her children  we are pulling together to cover whatever needs to be covered  and upon encouragement by several close friends we decided to put together this GoFundMe as a way for our friends and community to take part. About NancyNancy moved to Orcas Island in 1997 from Seattle and has lived in the islands ever since  while spending some years on Lopez before returning back to settle on Orcas. She is a mom of four  a grandma  and a \"Nana\" to many island youth. She is a caregiver  a midwife  a gardener  and a musician. If you live on Orcas Island you may know Nancy as the \"Marimba Lady\". That's because she has played and taught marimba music in the islands for the past 20 years. For many years it was a common occurrence on Orcas to hear marimba music resonating out from the town park. Nancy's signature during a performance is always to convince a random person from the audience to come up and learn to play on the spot  and which point she'll teach them a part and they'll be performing with the band in no time!\"Family-style\" Marimba in the parkNancy with baby Ruby 28 years ago.---With Gratitude Learner  Ruby  Lucas and Davis"
