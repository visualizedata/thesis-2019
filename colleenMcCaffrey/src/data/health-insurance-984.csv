Weeks passed with his pain getting worse. After numerous visits to the hospital  with no action he was finally diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of his left hip.In layman's terms  that means the femur head is no longer receiving blood  causing the bone to rot. Sometimes there are medical treatments to prevent the decay  but unfortunately Chris's femur head collapsed prematurely within months of the accident. This means he cannot walk or stand for a long time without having severe pain. Sleeping is virtually impossible without waking up from pain. Or sometimes the pain is so horrible he will have a seizure that causes him to pass out for a few hours. To go from an athletic ball of energy that used to walk the entire island that is his hometown  to not being able to leave the house without prepping days in advance  has caused a depression he fights every day. This gofundme is for a years worth of insurance at $400 a month  so $4800. This insurance has a $3000 deductible  doctors appointments are $25  specialist doctors are $50. Hospital visits are 20% after the deductible is paid. It also provides vision and dental  coverage he has not had since he was 18. This insurance is incredibly necessary to give Chris his way of life back  and the ability to provide for our family's future. The past two years have been rough monetarily  but we made it work. I absolutely cannot afford this insurance  but I will do everything possible to give Chris back stability.  We just need a little help."

We judge and judge people  because we think we know them from what we see. False  we just know their outsides. Many of you don’t know I have a sister  but I do - an older one too. She’s been facing demons ever since the 6th grade. It sucks. Trust me  it’s now like I have to play the role of the older sister. Right now  I can’t - I just can’t hold it together anymore.Just this Thanksgiving  I almost lost a sister to these demons fueled by society. She was involved in a car accident where she was harassed and taken advantage of - it wasn’t her fault. With the ongoing pressure and lawsuit accusations  my sister fell into a spiral and gave up. This giving up doesn’t mean kicking a rock on the floor and sighing  “Urgh  I give up.” She gave up. We’re now currently facing a huge medical bill  for her being in the ICU  that we can’t take care of.We kindly appreciate any donations. Amy is still in recovery right now. She has a long  bright journey ahead. Any donations and support helps! Remember  always be kind to another because you don’t know what that person has gone through or is going through.

While she thought she had an inflammation in her throat from a cold a few months prior  it turned out to be a malignant growth in her throat. The growth was removed in Ukraine  and that is how a diagnosis was obtained. In an effort to fight for her life  she thought that returning to the United States for treatment  where her husband and daughters reside  was her best option. However so far  it is not turning out to be so. Alina does not have health insurance  and she has been turned down for immediate treatment here in the US. The Financial Assistance program that may potentially become available to her is a very long and drawn out process  and Alina needs treatment now. The growth in her throat has been removed in Ukraine back in the beginning of October  and she was told she needed to start treatment within 4-6 weeks after the removal. It has now been over 6 weeks  and the next available appointment for her scan without health insurance is not until the end of December. Alina absolutely cannot afford to wait that long! Her life literally depends on starting the treatment of this very aggressive form of cancer. We are desperately trying to fundraise  so she can start the medical treatment she needs now as she is not able to wait for the financial assistance to kick in. I urge you to not just pass this by  as every donation  even if it is $1  whatever the amount may be  collectively will make a huge difference. Alina’s husband is struggling to provide for their family of 4  and their oldest daughter is currently unable to work as she is helping with their youngest daughter while Alina undergoes several appointments  labs and tests.This is a very heartbreaking situation  but the beauty and hope here is that we can all help. Not all of us can donate a lot  but it is in the numbers of us is where it will make a difference. Please donate $1  $3 or $5 if that is all you can do. When many of us come together  we can help greatly. This is a season of giving  please remember Alina  and how much she will benefit from every donation. Thank you so much  we truly appreciate you and your help. God Bless"

It takes a special kind of person to deal with the little ones day in and day out but she loves the babies that are in her care and loves spending each day with them. She is a very compassionate  loving  thoughtful woman and she is my heart and soul. In January of this year Dawn was diagnosed with pneumonia. During this time she saw the doctor on 5 different visits and was prescribed an assortment of medications to combat her sickness. After the numerous medications the doctor was finally able to find a combination to heal her pneumonia. We are just beginning to see the medical bills come in for her pneumonia treatment and there seems to be no end in sight. Like many people in our country  Dawn has no insurance and is unable to afford any health insurance plans that provide the coverage that she needs. Since overcoming pneumonia  she developed a condition with her heart. Her primary care physician  through numerous attempts  was able to find a cardiologist that would see her without insurance. We met with the financial advisor today at the cardiologist's office and was able to pay for today's visit which was basically a consultation to lead to tests. She is currently wearing a 24 hour heart monitor to start with  however  she is going to need further testing which we don't have the means to cover. She is unable to work currently and don't know when she will be able to go back. I work full-time and pickup odd jobs on the side when I can.  Dawn and I both come from families that would rather starve than ask for help from anyone  I guess you would call us both full of pride. Please consider making a small donation to help financially with the cardiac tests that she desperately needs. Thank you to each and every one of you all!Frederick"

Since then  while in job search mode  I've managed to hang on financially with limited funds from severance   unemployment  401k funds and finally  early filing of social security benefits. I've also received help from dear friends who keep me in their prayers  loan me supplies  equipment and money knowing there is no certain date of repayment but continue to believe in me when I don't think I can stand another second of insecurity and fear. It's a cliche but true regatdless;Looking for job is a full time job all by itself. Keeping yourself pumped up and positive isn't easy when there seems to be no end in sight to the struggle. So  I'm taking a couple of deep  cleansing breaths and keeping  at the search. Since I don't yet qualify for Medicare  I have continued my health coverage through COBRA. Because of preexisting conditions and my age  I  am hoping this Go Fund Me account will help me to collect enough money to pay my remaining COBRA premiums. I have been able to manage until now with savings and funds as previously described. Now though  I'm falling short $1000/month  for RX copays and my COBRA health premiumCollecting $6 000 to cover premiums  copays and RX expenses combined with SS benefits will keep me current with monthly expenses (as long as the doggies stay heathly and the 15 yr old car keeps going...) for at least 6 more months. I'm determined to have this resolved before that deadline!Unfortunately  my age places me in a difficult position for the market health coverage and COBRA continuation (as expensive as it is) is cheaper than anything I can buy on the Georgia open market (but I keep looking).Through much agonizing tinged with some shame at even being in such a situation   I'm asking for your help through this Go Fund Me campaign. Let me be very clear that I do know how difficult things are for many of you and I certainly don't want to be another hardship for you. And  if you know me at all  you know how I hate asking for help ... sometimes to a fault.  As my resources are now precariously low  my fears of my future can be incapacitating. I'm sure you all know how this feels from struggles of your own.If you are able to help me out with this COBRA health premium expense funding campaign  my appreciation would be immeasurable. If you are not able to help financially at this time  your prayers and good thoughts and wishes are equally needed and appreciated.Thank you for thinking of me. I wish you and your family the very best for 2019 and beyond. I think 2019 will be a banner year for all of us. Let me know when things start improving on your end of the planet.Much love  Fran"

I had these receipts in my pocket and was so out of it I required assistance from the pharmacy clerk to even do a minor task  use a debit card.  I sat in the vehicle for a short spell and proceeded to return into the store to get the remainder of a grocery list I had for my mother.  I am not sure if I was headed back into the store or coming out  but I was detained  but not arrested or charged with a crime  by a local Eden City Police officer.  I do not know the officers name or badge number.  I am in fear of more repercussions if I attempt to go to the Eden City Police and get the report.  Every time I see a police vehicle  I have some kind of panic attack or something.  I have fear of reprisal because I have decided to raise my voice against these types of actions.   From my understanding of the situation they believed I was under the influence of something.  I was violently restrained and placed into the back of a police vehicle  and all of this was happening while I was having a serious medical attack.  To the best of my recollection  the police officer got the head of Wal-Mart security to come out and tell me that I was banned from the establishment and if I returned  I would be arrested for criminal trespassing.  Keep in mind that my head was banged all around while I am under medical duress.  It seemed like quite a while before the officer actually returned to the vehicle.  I remember specifically trying to explain to them that I was not under the influence and that something was seriously wrong.  I also vividly remember leaving in the police vehicle and being thrown all over the backseat and hitting my head more than a few times and the officer laughing about this.  I was never charged with a crime nor arrested for anything.  That is the last clear memory I have until a couple of days later.  I ended up at UNC Rockingham Health Care hospital.  They say that I went into a deep coma and ended up being placed on some kind of life support once they got in touch with my mother.  The doctor there was in direct communication with a neurologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.  They did all types of screening and figured out that I was not under the influence of anything.  All of my drug and alcohol tests came back negative.  UNC Rockingham had previously seen me for having one of these types of seizures a couple of weeks before this.  I do not remember any of this.  My mother came into the emergency room and talked with the doctor but they could not figure anything out.  My mother got what possessions I had on me  which two things were missing.  I was air-lifted to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center by helicopter.  I spent three days in the ICU center there after got me semi-awake.  I was kept in a locked down ward because I had a lot of serious confusion.  I did not even know simple things such as the year or the president.  I also did not know certain family members.  I was eventually relocated into a regular patient room.  It is not until this point that I have any resemblance of a memory.  Once I was stabilized and had enough seizure medication in my system  I was released from Wake Forest January 8  2019.  My head or my brain  still is nowhere close to being normal.   I do not have any kind of health insurance  and now I have astronomical hospital bills that haven’t even started coming in yet.  I have no idea how I can possibly pay these bills that could have been avoided.  On January 10  2019 I was at home and sometime around 4 PM I had some type of seizure.  My mother came into my bedroom and found me trying to get up out of the floor.  I was not able to respond to basic conversation.  I do not remember anything about that day until around 11:30 PM or so.  I woke up and was in my bed and I knew something was not quite right with me.  I went to wake my mother up to take me to UNC Rockingham hospital.  As I was waking her up  I went into some type of grand mal seizure.  To the best of my knowledge I have never had one of this type before.  There is no explanation for the increase in frequency or severity of my seizures.  I have gone for years without having one to having multiple in a day and more severe.  They have given me a higher dose of medication and so far  there have not any other seizures   I still am nowhere close to the person I was before. This entire situation could have been avoided if the officer would have just looked at the paper I have in my wallet.  It is wrapped around my ID and in huge highlighted letters it states that I have a seizure disorder as well as the list of medications I take  none of which are narcotic nor impairing.  Now I have applied for every kind of aid possible  but none will be completed in time for me to see the neurologist on February 12  2019.   They are expecting a payment of $210 before they will even see me.  I defimiately need this appointment because of the increse in frequency and fogginess in my brain.  I am also going to have to get medications which I have no idea of the cost of.  Without health insurance its hard."

When a person has two or more unprovoked seizures  they are considered to have epilepsy. A seizure happens when a brief  strong surge of electrical activity affects part or all of the brain. Cerebral palsy is the most common motor and movement disability. It is a neurological disorder that affects a child's motor skills  movements  and muscle tone. Cerebral palsy is caused by brain damage that develops while the baby is still in utero  during labor and delivery  or shortly after birth.As a parent of a child with Cerebral Palsy  the feeling of uncertainty has no bound  but it is even more amplified when seizures are added to the mix. Lailani's seizures vary in duration  intensity  frequency  physical presentation  and controllability. For Lailani  dealing with her seizures can feel like a roller coaster. Luckily  recent advances in seizure prevention and treatment have made seizures less scary than they used to be. Years ago Lailani had undergone a procedure to surgically implant a device known as a Baclofen Pump into her abdomen to help manage her violent muscle spasms associate to her Cerebral Palsy. The baclofen pump system consists of a pump and a catheter that brings the medication from the pump into the spinal fluid. The pump is a round metallic disc (about 1 inch thick and 3 inches in diameter)  which is surgically implanted under the skin of the abdomen. The pump contains a battery  which usually lasts between five to seven years  a reservoir for the medication  and a microprocessor.Unfortunately  the device is beginning to fail sooner than expected  and as a result  her muscle spasms are becoming more frequent and violent. The stress her body goes through during these spasms at times causes her to experience unpredictable seizures. This device needs to be replaced as soon as possible to prevent further harm. We hope to have her surgery this summer  but it may have to be sooner than that. This device has genuinely been a benefit to her life and has allowed her to have a more independent lifestyle. I am 54 years old working three jobs to save enough money to pay for the portion of the procedure my health insurance will not cover. I come to you all with a heavy heart and only ask of you to give what you can and help Lailani. We thank you all for your time and support.Bless you All"

Lots of work is being done  but there's a lack of payments coming in for said work. This has resulted in a struggle to pay for basic things  from utilities bills and groceries  to major things like health insurance.

"Medical","December 7, 2018","Health Insurance for 2019","$155","$3,600","6","4","6","49","ELGIN","SC","My story is somewhat of a long one so here it goes.I am chronically ill. I was diagnosed with Depression at 14  Generalized Anxiety Disorder at 16  Panic Disorder at 17  PTSD at 18  and Bipolar I Disorder at 21. In order to treat these disorders I need to take medication  go to monthly doctor visits  psychotherapy  and occasional hospitalization. Because all of these treatments require money  I have to have a good health insurance plan in order to afford them all. In the past I have been able to have great coverage for as little as $23 a month thanks to a $300 subsidy given to me by the ACA. On May 29th of 2018 I married a wonderful  former Marine. This means in 2019 I am going to lose most of my subsidy. This is because Jacob is offered insurance through his job. Because Jacob is a veteran  he can receive health care through the VA and does not need regular insurance coverage. However  his job requires that we both be on the plan if we get insurance through them. The premium through them is $455 and does not cover my expenses nearly as well as we need it to. I do not get any benefits from the US Military as we married after he was honorably discharged.So I opted to go through Marketplace (ACA) to see what plan I could do in order to be able to afford my medications. I currently take eight medications - seven of which have generic forms and are only Tier 1 level medicines. They cost the least and are covered by even the most basic plans. The eighth medication is on Tier 2 and is called Latuda. It is an anti-psychotic that does not have a generic form. I have been taking this medication since 2014 and it has helped me greatly with my Bipolar Disorder. It doesn't cause me to gain weight and is even safe to take while pregnant if I were to become so. Latuda is roughly $1600 for a 30 day supply. With my current plan I pay $11. The lower level insurance plans do NOT cover this medication and I would have to pay the full amount in order to get it. In order to continue to take this extremely effective medication  I need at least a Silver level plan which are more expensive. I chose the cheapest of the Silver level plans in order to get the coverage I need. I do qualify for a $117 dollar subsidy  however I would still need to pay $343 out of pocket each month to cover my premium. This does not include costs of treatments each month. Because of my disability  I can only work part-time. I do not qualify for health insurance through my job. This is my only option if I want to be covered next year. I have tried other medications but none have been as effective at Latuda. In order to maintain my mental health  I need to continue to take this medication. I set the goal for $3 600 to cover $300 a month for next year. Any additional raised will go towards medical bills (copays  medication costs  etc).

But Angel's life is anything but ordinary.  Three years ago  Angel was diagnosed with Hereditary-Spastic-Paraplegia. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)  also called familial spastic paraparesis (FSP)  refers to a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity (stiffness) of the legs. Angel's symptoms started to present in her early 20s.Early in the disease course  there may be mild gait difficulties and stiffness. These symptoms typically slowly progress so that eventually individuals with HSP may require the assistance of a cane  walker  or wheelchair. Angel now has as her constant companion  her pink wheelchair  Penelope.Though the primary features of HSP are progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness  complicated forms may be accompanied by other symptoms. Angel is also plagued by ataxia (lack of muscle coordination) and epilepsy. She is in near constant pain and recently underwent surgery to have a pump implanted to distribute medication to help control her muscle spasms. There are no specific treatments to prevent  slow or reverse HSP.Even while dealing with these issues  Angel maintains the attitude that she is not \"disabled\".  She has continued to work in order to pay for medical insurance and additional expenses not covered by insurance.  Her resilience is inspiring.Recently  Angel was dealt a set-back when she was laid-off from her job.  She had hoped the lay-off would be temporary  but unfortunately that may not be the case.This GoFundMe account is being set-up to help Angel cover the cost of her medical insurance and to help raise funds for a new wheelchair (which she will require soon).Thank you for taking the time to read this.  And thank you in advance for donating to this worthwhile cause.  If you would like to learn more about HSP or donate to HSP research  please visit  www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorder/Hereditary-Spastic-Paraplegia-Information-Page."

For the last two years she has been in a lot of pain in her knee  causing her to walk very slowly and to not walk straight. Doctors gave her many injections into the knee thinking it would help  as she can not afford a knee replacement. As her pain was getting worse over the year  a different doctor did some tests and MRIs and noticed that she has a bad disk extrusion in her spine. He has informed her that she immediately has to go into surgery as any wrong movement can paralyze her.  As this is a very difficult surgery and does not allow for any mistakes  as it could paralyze her  it is recommended to go to a well-known surgeon in the United States. She has to come up with $35 000 to cover the surgery and has to do it as soon as possible.

I had no idea what was happening. We immediately called 911 for help. She was suffocating with her own vomit. I immediately began CPR on my wife. The paramedics arrived on the scene. They took her to the local hospital  but unfortunately they could do nothing as her situation was very serious & they determined she would not survive. They had her airlifted & transported to Seattle  WA. Once  we arrived in Seattle  they immediately took my wife to surgery. After the surgery  the doctor explained that my wife had an intracerebral hemorrhage. Her blood pressure was over 200. The doctor explained that this was bleeding on the brain & the next 48 hours were very critical. He explained that most people do not survive this even with surgery. He explained that I needed to prepare for the worst & prepare our children as well. In the next 48 hours  my wife was on a ventilator  which was breathing for her. She showed no change. They had left part of her skull open from the surgery to monitor the swelling of the brain as well as the bleeding in her brain. After 48 hours  the doctors asked me to sign the papers to remove my wife from the ventilator  stating that nothing else could be done. I did not believe this because my wife is a fighter. We have children & grandchildren. I was not ready to let my wife go. The next morning I met with another doctor  who immediately took my wife to another surgery on her throat & later on her stomach. Later that evening  my wife regained consciousness. However  she only has opened her eyes & moved her hands a little. She has had the ventilator from her mouth removed  but the opening on her skull is still there. They have performed 4 surgeries at this time. I work in the apple orchards in WA. We do not have health insurance & I’m very concerned for the amount of the medical bills & how I will pay for them. I am the sole provider for our family. I lost my job due to being in the hospital with my wife. So now there is no income as well as no insurance.

El 4 de diciembre de 2018  mi esposa  Karla  de repente cayó al suelo. No tenía idea de lo que estaba pasando. Inmediatamente llamamos al 911 para pedir ayuda. Se estaba asfixiando con su propio vómito. Inmediatamente comencé RCP en mi esposa. Los paramédicos llegaron a la escena. La llevaron al hospital local  pero desafortunadamente no pudieron hacer nada ya que su situación era muy seria y determinaron que no sobreviviría. La llevaron en avión y la transportaron a Seattle  WA. Una vez que llegamos a Seattle  inmediatamente llevaron a mi esposa a la cirugía. Después de la cirugía  el médico explicó que mi esposa tenía una hemorragia intracerebral. Su presión arterial estaba por encima de 200. El médico le explicó que esto estaba sangrando en el cerebro y que las siguientes 48 horas eran muy críticas. Explicó que la mayoría de las personas no sobreviven incluso con cirugía. Explicó que necesitaba prepararme para lo peor y preparar a nuestros hijos también. En las próximas 48 horas  mi esposa estaba en un ventilador  que respiraba por ella. Ella no mostró ningún cambio. Habían dejado parte de su cráneo abierto de la cirugía para controlar la inflamación del cerebro  así como el sangrado en su cerebro. Después de 48 horas  los médicos me pidieron que firmara los papeles para retirar a mi esposa del ventilador  indicando que no se podía hacer nada más. No creí esto porque mi esposa es una luchadora. Tenemos hijos y nietos. No estaba listo para dejar ir a mi esposa. A la mañana siguiente  me encontré con otro médico  quien de inmediato llevó a mi esposa a otra cirugía en su garganta y luego en su estómago. Más tarde esa noche  mi esposa recuperó la conciencia. Sin embargo  solo ha abierto los ojos y ha movido un poco las manos. Le han quitado el ventilador de la boca  pero la abertura de su cráneo todavía está allí. Han realizado 4 cirugías en este momento. Yo trabajo en los huertos de manzanas en WA. No tenemos seguro de salud y estoy muy preocupado por el monto de las facturas médicas y cómo las pagaré. Soy el único proveedor de nuestra familia. Perdí mi trabajo por estar en el hospital con mi esposa. Así que ahora no hay ingresos ni seguro. Tengo fe en que todo saldrá bien  pero también pregunto si alguien puede ayudar  por favor  háganlo. Sé que los tiempos son muy difíciles para todos y cada persona tiene su propia historia y situación. Sin embargo  si hay alguna forma de donar $ 5  $ 10  $ 20 o lo que sea  mi familia agradecería enormemente su ayuda en este asunto.

I was receiving medical benefits through that job  but they ended when I left. I took a job that made me happier but paid much less  and didn’t include benefits. When I applied for Medicaid  I was denied for making an average of $60 too much per month  and when I sent in a 24-page appeal  I was denied for not having severe enough health problems.My medical probs: I have lupus (an autoimmune disorder) that has caused severe kidney damage  including causing kidney failure/hospitalization in the past. I suffer from high blood pressure and skin issues  also as a consequence of lupus. I should be on meds for all of that (especially for my blood pressure)  but I haven’t been on in them in months and it’s taking a physical toll. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression  but I’m off of those antidepressants now as well. To boot  my wisdom teeth have been coming in since summer and cause me daily headaches that I’m treating with a lot of over-the-counter meds  and several days ago I started spontaneously losing sight in my left eye. *insert shrug emoji here* But I can’t afford to see an ophthalmologist without insurance  so I’m waiting until January and just…. Hoping for the best?I started a new job a few days ago  which will provide me more money in general AND health benefits starting in March  but before then I desperately need to see some doctors and address my sight and blood pressure issues (at least!). I enrolled in the ACA so I can have coverage in two short weeks  but I have to pay a $324 premium by the 1st of January in order to keep it.Because I’m changing jobs right now  money was already going to be tight between December and January  and now it’s going to be a lot tighter. I won’t have my first regular paycheck from my new job until the January 12th of the new year.I know it’s the holidays and pretty much everyone is strapped for cash; I know  too  that I’m not the only one asking for help right now.

It is the law that adults who were formerly in foster care are entitled to and eligible for medicaid until age 26:  \"In addition to allowing young adults to remain on their parents insurance until age 26  the ACA allows for former foster youth to remain eligible for medicaid until 26 as well without regard to income.\"I was fed this sentence a hundred times over while I was in care  and repeatedly after. I did nothing to trigger a stop or tick in the system to make me ineligible (it is virtually impossible until I am 26 to be ineligible).I have gone to fix this at county/state office buildings to no avail. My husband and I recently became pregnant as we'd planned because I was sure that I was covered by Medicaid and would be safe and stable to get through all of the (very numerous) OBGYN and primary care visits.We are planning on taking legal action  because whoever made this mistake has fully broken a law and is hiding behind their pride & doesn't want/know how to correct it. But as we all know  babies don't wait for court cases to get over to grow.I have still not seen a sonogram of my baby  nor have I had my first real OBGYN appointment because of the error in my health insurance. My husband and I are saving money to get a new apartment to make room for the baby and we are moving in July. We have little to no extra money to spend and any donations will be put toward a monthly premium so that I can afford insurance that is (unfortunately) not medicaid.I appreciate you so much for reading and donating."

The last 2 treatments  I was changing jobs and my new insurance didn’t kick in for 90 days. Staff at my eye doctors kindly convinced me that these treatments are necessary so my vision doesn’t worsen. I was terrified of not being able to see well enough to perform my job duties working with the disabled. I went ahead with self pay because it was $250 an injection. I was on a payment plan. As it turned out  my 5 prior eye injections were not fully covered by my former insurance even though I paid the copayments. Now I owe what the insurance didn’t pay plus the 2 self pay injections. I went to get an eye exam to see how well the treatments were working and they discovered I now have the beginning stages of glaucoma. When leaving  they made 2 appointments  one for yet another injection and one for the glaucoma. I received a phone call from the eye doctors office later and was told they will not treat my eyes until I pay the full amount which is a little over $800. Within only 3 months of our agreement  I have not been able to pay and the payment plan has been void  according to them. Training with a new company to work with the disabled starts soon and that insurance won’t kick in for 90 days as well. Unfortunately I do not have $800 to pay the eye doctor but I know my treatments for the macular edema and glaucoma must be treated. I’ve never asked for help through go fund me for myself but because these treatments will help support my livelihood and daily life. There are no family members for me to ask so I am asking you. Anything put forth for this would be immensely appreciated. Whichever way this turns out  my faith and love for God will be just as strong! Thank you and God bless!"

It was manageable for some time but situations arose that no longer allowed me to be able to pay. All the while  I am in and out of the hospital dealing with an aggressive case of pneumonia and severe anxiety attacks due to not having my medications.By the time the new year hit  I owed $1000 in health insurance premiums and I have no insurance until it is paid in full.

She has been doing radiation  constantly in and out the hospital  which has taken a major tole on  her body. She hasn't been able to work as much because of her condition but still tries to find strength in her weaknesses.  I have began to see how hard it is for her to do simple tasks sometimes   but even through that  she is truly a fighter.Just recently  she has been falling quite often and has suffered a broken ankle as well as getting into a car accident about a month ago.On top of her not being able to work she also does not have medical insurance and has had a hard time paying for her bills. With her recent car accident  the hospital she attended (not even over night) has added extra charges to her bill  that she cannot pay off. Even though I know my grandmother is heartbroken about the matter  she still tries to be strong and wear a smile on her face.Arlene is always a giver and has a heart for those around her. Even when she doesn't have much money  she would give her last to someone in need. She's always stopping and making sure whoever she sees in distress  is okay at the moment. She truly puts others before herselfI am a college student and trying my absolute best to support her and help her as much as I can  even if it's not a lot.

He was rushed directly into surgery upon being brought to the trauma center of John Muir Hospital in nearby Walnut Creek. Tim had sustained severe head trauma when he fell  and doctors needed to act quickly to reduce the swelling and bleeding in his brain  removing a piece of his skull in the process. He spent the next 3 weeks in the ICU on life support  with a breathing machine  constant IV fluids  and intubated feeding while his doctors worked to keep him alive and bring him back to consciousness. Mom (Debbie) and Dad (Frank) flew out to be with him immediately  who were quickly followed by brothers Andy  Jeff  and Jonathan  and girlfriend Natalie. Tim has been moved several times since to Kentfield Hospital for rehabilitative care and treatment  and back to John Muir  where surgeons have replaced the piece of his skull that was removed.  He is now in Acute Rehab at John Muir.It has been a difficult road for Tim. With the damage he received to his brain in the fall  he awoke with only limited control of the muscles in his left side  and no ability to move his right side at all. Communication is a significant challenge as his speech center in the temporal lobe was damaged  but doctors believe that he can regain some of this in time  with daily therapy to redevelop and train the neural pathways from his brain to the rest of his body.He has seen great progress and wonderful care under the watchful eye of his doctors and therapists  and has even begun to regain his comprehension and the use of his right arm and leg! Mom and Dad have never left his side during this time  taking time away from home and work to protect one of the most valuable things in their lives; Dad even having to resign from his job to be there for Tim. While his doctors and family work to provide the very best care for Tim  the road ahead will be very long  and very difficult...To date  the costs for John Muir are an upwards of $2 162 000  not including the $35 000 bill from Kentfield - much of this will be covered by insurance  but not all  and Mom and Dad's temporary relocation/living expenses in California for the last few months have been a factor. We do not have an estimate for the anticipated expenses of Tim's ongoing care but his co-pays and deductibles will exceed $10 000   and he is in need of handicap accessible items (ie. wheelchair)  adaptive equipment  and home modifications that are not covered by insurance.Tim will be leaving CA (sometime in December) to continue therapy in Boston  which will continue for months. With no ability to work  he will have no income  depending on support from family for ongoing expenses  including increased health insurance costs and everyday living expenses  as he continues on his long road to recovery.We now need your help to get through this difficult time. His progress is encouraging  but he will have a great deal of work to do before he can get back to the Tim Butterworth that everyone knows and loves. Still a talented musician and performer  we know that he will still be able to bring people smiles  but he will need your help to get there. Please help us to help Tim bring music to the world again!"

Ray ported Python so that it could be cross-compiled using MinGW-w64/GCC to be hosted on Windows  built on GNU/Linux as part of a complete toolchain build for final embedding into GDB. This was a requirement for Qt Creator debuggers to work correctly.  He then released his own version of the Google Android NDK using the above GDB/Python work. These were the first NDK toolchains released to run natively on Windows (rather than being Cygwin based)  to support ARM Neon and to be based on the Linaro Android GCC sources. Subsequently this work  including the Python port was merged to Google's upstream Android source code repositories.  Ray co-founded the MSYS2 project. The project ported ArchLinux's Pacman to Windows and maintains 'PKGBUILD' recipes and patches for more than 1000 Open Source software packages. MSYS2 is now the recommended upstream or build environment for many Open Source projects  Git for Windows  Rust  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler  Gnome and KiCad among them.   Since joining Anaconda  Inc. in February 2016  Ray has done a huge amount of work to propel the Anaconda Distribution forward.  Most notably  he was responsible for the great leap forward in our compilers with the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release. In case you missed it  this blog post  highlighted the performance and security improvements.  Ray managed to wear out his keyboard from the amount of effort he put into the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release! Ray is responsible for the development of the R and MRO conda packages.  He is also the one the Anaconda Distribution team relies on whenever it comes to tricky compiler issues.  On many occasions  he has tracked a tricky bug into assembly code and fixed it. He has made numerous patches to address CVE vulnerabilities.  He has managed to jump through crazy hoops at times to ensure that the Anaconda Distribution remains compatible with the widest range of systems and hardware. Whatever the challenge  he has remained a critical member of the team who supports his fellow teammates.  In spite of his remarkable ability and contributions  Ray is very humble  hardworking and affable.  Despite his daunting condition  he remains upbeat and incredibly dedicated to continuing his work and open-source contributions.  Ray has undergone treatment in the UK since his diagnosis in March.  Unfortunately  the doctors there believed operating on Ray’s tumors would be too risky to attempt.  Ray obtained a second opinion at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  TX  where they believe surgery is both possible and advisable.  Here’s the catch: with immigration laws and health insurance policies  we can’t get Ray covered for his operation to happen at M.D. Anderson.  To give Ray the best chance at surviving this  we want to pitch in and help him obtain the best care possible.Since he has given so much to the Anaconda community and the broader open source community - we want to give others the opportunity to help him as well.  In recognition of Ray’s vast contributions to our community  and in the hopes of helping him beat cancer  please join us in contributing towards his treatment.  Contributions here will be matched 1:1 up to $50 000 by Anaconda  Inc.  Ray has an immediate need for funds leading to surgery in the beginning of December  and will have an ongoing need for continuing treatment afterwards."

The sound of his grandma singing to him  the feeling of the sun on his face  eating sweet ripe bananas  listening to his mama reading him stories  and going for daily walks in the fresh air with his daddy. Soon  a terrible disease will cause him to lose the ability to eat by mouth  to smile and to laugh  to see  to hear  and to move his little body.Our precious boy has been diagnosed with a rare terminal brain disease called Krabbe disease  a type of leukodystrophy. Krabbe is an inherited genetic disease. Children with this disease can’t create enough of a substance called galactosylceramidase  which is needed to make myelin. Myelin is the material your body uses to surround and protect nerve fibers. Without this protection  cells in the brain will die  and the nerves in the brain and other parts of the body will not work properly. There is currently no cure for Krabbe disease. Babies with this condition have a life expectancy of 13 months.This news has been unbearable and impossible to fully comprehend. That is why I now ask for your help on behalf of my sister (Lana) and brother-in-law (Dragan).Because there is no cure for Krabbe  children with the infantile onset receive only palliative care and supportive therapy. To help keep Nikola comfortable  there are therapies and special equipment to ease his pain. Most of this is not covered by health insurance and is extremely costly. Additionally  there is only one physician in the U.S. that specializes in this rare disease. Dr. Maria Escolar (Director  Program for the Study of Neurodevelopment in Rare Disorders) is located in Pittsburg  PA. Anytime Nikola must be seen by her  Nikola’s parents have to travel from Virginia to Pennsylvania at their own cost (flights  hotel  car rental  etc.).Our goal with this campaign is to help Nikola’s family obtain necessary medical equipment to ease complications and comorbidities associated with Krabbe disease. Our other mission is to bring awareness about this terrible disease. There are only 4 states in the country that test for Krabbe on the newborn screen at birth. If treated at birth  Krabbe victims can have a significantly better outcome and live a longer life. Any additional funds we raise from this campaign will be donated to Hunter’s Hope. Hunter’s Hope Foundation addresses the acute need for information and research with respect to Krabbe Disease and related Leukodystrophies. This organization is pushing for legislation for testing as it could have saved Nikola’s life and the lives of many other babies with Krabbe Leukodystrophy.

Bryan suffers from terminal cancer  and his only hope of survival is a stem cell transplant. Bryan is not the type of guy to ask for financial help. He is “true grit” so this is very painful for him on multiple levels. They say our family are the friends we choose. Bryan is our family in so many ways. Not only is he an amazing father and grandfather  He is giving  caring  and possesses the rare character that prompted one friend to comment: “ if you were stuck in the desert at 3:00 am   Bryan is the guy you would call knowing that you could count on him to come and save you”.  He always has put himself out there for his friends  his kids  grandkids and his community. Now  he needs to count on us!Bryan was diagnosed with AML Granulocytic Sarcoma (Leukemia) in 2008. He underwent bowel surgery removing a tumor  along with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has suffered numerous side effects from those treatments. Presently he has blood cancer  “myelodysplastic syndrome” and  is in treatment at the Intermountain Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplant program. This is his only chance of survival beyond only a few years. Since April 2018 his health has declined. Because of his cancer and associated immune deficiency  he was hospitalized with Pneumonia in June  and again in September for a bowel obstruction at the site of his tumor. Since then he has been through several rounds of chemo  radiation and just completed a Bone marrow transplant on Tuesday November 13th with a life saving stem cell infusion from his (donor) son Winston. Thank God for Winston.Unfortunately just prior to his bone marrow transplant  Bryan learned from his doctors that  he also has a heart condition that may improve upon recovery.To compound an already difficult situation  and according to Bryan’s doctor in a letter dated January 26th 2018: “ It is anticipated that Mr. Morris will need an allogeneic stem cell transplant to cure him from the disease. Mr Morris will be required to remain within 30 minutes of LDS Hospital for approximately a year following the transplant for treatment  follow-up appointments and monitoring of his condition. He will need a full time caregiver and we recommend he not return to work due to the risk of infections and the immunocompromised state he will be in at that time” Bryan is 61 years of age  legal retirement age  without any prospect of having a living wage. While he continues to suffer from recovering from cancer  he has no disability insurance  but is applying for SSDI  and will hear back within the year. It still won’t be enough to  to meet his monthly living expenses. The burdens of his battles with cancer over the last decade and his divorce have left him with no financial resources to pay his medical expenses or even survive. He has no savings  he can’t spend much time around his grandkids because of his poor immune system  and his dog just died; the icing on his tragically melting cake. Bryan needs a minimum of $3800 (living expenses + health insurance premiums + out of pocket medical) per month to sustain him for the next year. This monthly amount only covers his minimum financial needs and health Insurance premiums  and DOES NOT include additional treatment: certain equipment needed for disability  possible lengthy hospital stays  medications  travel expenses (he will not be able to drive for some time) and more. Depending on how fast Bryan’s health progresses after the transplant  additional bills could add up fast.His last day of work was October 31st  2018  and for the most part has been in LDS hospital since that time. His “Cobra” Insurance that will  pay for the transplant is $1200 per month  and his insurance does not pay for all of the treatments he needs until he can meet an annual out-of-pocket cost of $4 000.Sacrificing even a little to help Bryan can provide him the much needed love  compassion  and emotional support along with the assistance  in showing him that you care.Just click the highlighted box with the words “Donate now” and 100% of your donation will be linked directly to a “Special Needs Trust” in the name of the Bryan Dinwoodey Morris Supplemental Trust with Zions Bank.

The family is very grateful for all of your financial support and prayers.  The current donated funds  and future donations will be used as needed for expenses. Tim and Jean Hoefling are well-loved residents of Louisville  CO. They are faithful Christians who served many years as missionaries and have been active members in their church community. Tim has always been a hardworking family man who has hardly known a day of ill health. Recently  he began to feel low on energy and unable to recover from what he thought was the flu. However  a few days ago he was admitted to the hospital because it was discovered that he has suffered two undiagnosed heart attacks  has a blood clot near his heart  and a systemic infection that cannot be identified. As of 3/25/19 he was air lifted to Anschutz where they have determined the best course of action is a heart transplant. The Hoeflings only have a health insurance co-op plan. The doctors will not move forward with the transplant until they are sure the money will be available to pay for it. They are looking at about $800 000. This  of course  does not include all the other medical bills and their regular monthly expenses while Tim is unable to work. This need is extremely time sensitive since the medical team is working to keep him alive until the money can be secured. Please consider giving if you can. No donation is too small and no amount of prayer is too much. UPDATE: While the situation remains urgent  and the heart transplant is currently not an option  there have been many answers to prayer. Tim's blood pressure and heart rate have stabilized and he is able to have short visits with friends and family. Many  many thanks to everyone who has been praying. Your prayers are being heard!"
"Medical","March 17, 2019","Sean Pittman Brain Cancer Battle Funds","$56,020","$50,000","521","1","536","1.9k","NEWMARKET","MD","The First Dark Clouds…Sean and Sara Pittman got married November  2012.  The couple had met at Mizuno Sporting goods in the Atlanta  GA area where they both worked. A daughter  Kylie  was born February  2014. It was a happy  normal life.When Kylie was 6 months old  after a long July 4th weekend  Sean started showing alarming symptoms. He started hearing unusual sounds and would stare blankly ahead during these episodes. Sara took him to the emergency room and waited in the parking lot in the car with little Kylie. It was the beginning of a difficult and frightening journey for them both.A CT scan and MRI showed a tumor in the left temporal lobe of his brain  the speech center. And something sounded abnormal with his heart. More medical testing was ordered. A malformed aortic heart valve (never diagnosed before) had created a life threatening emergency  a very large aneurysm in his aorta. In a day and a half  Sean was diagnosed as needing open heart surgery and surgery for a brain tumor.  The two medical crises were unrelated. Sean looked healthy. He was an ex professional baseball player for God's sake.  Why is this happening? That was July  2014.Surgery #1His open heart surgery was performed in Atlanta two months later in September. The medical bills and anxiety had barely paused when it was time for…Surgery #2Two months of recovery passed. Next up for Sean was brain surgery  an awake craniotomy  which was also done in Atlanta in November. The medical team there wanted to opt for immediate chemotherapy and radiation following surgery. The two sought a second opinion  heading to Baltimore  MD and met with the top neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins  Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa. Dr. Q  as he’s affectionately known  felt almost no tumor had been removed and pledged he could remove nearly all of it. At that time  it was believed the tumor was benign. Only a few months later it was time for…Surgery #3 (brain surgery #2)Dr. Q operated on Sean in March  2015 in Baltimore. He said he was able to remove nearly all the tumor. However  this type of tumor  an anaplastic astrocytoma  has tentacles and infiltrates the brain where it can’t be removed. Testing on the tumor showed it to be grade 3 or malignant. It was more than a tumor now. It was definitely cancer.At this time  it was decided to monitor Sean with regular MRI imaging of his brain  to watch and wait.  This period  about a year and a half  offered a respite from surgery but not from the anxiety of the medical bills and fear of what may lie ahead. Another baby was born  Kaleb  and Sara was laid off from her 13 year corporate job. Sara has tried to help contribute financially during this time with teaching preschool  dog sitting and selling essential oils. Full time work has simply not been feasible because of the cost of day care and the travel and time associated with his surgeries. Financial stresses mounted. And the tumor returned.Surgery #4 (brain surgery #3)Dr. Q had moved his medical team to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  Florida. Sean and Sara followed him there. Surgery was done in December  2017. This time there would be no watching and waiting. It was time to attack the tumor  so radiation and chemotherapy ensued. Sean was monitored with more frequent MRIs  driving the 6 hours between Atlanta and Jacksonville every two months or less. He would sleep in his car in the Mayo Clinic parking lot to save money.The most recent MRI (3/7/19) showed a return of cancer. This time it was in another part of the brain  the hippocampus  where memory is stored. The medical team at Mayo and Dr. Q are opting for a 4th brain surgery. It’s urgent  because the tumor is growing.Surgery #5 (brain surgery #4)Scheduled for March 29  2019. Dr. Q hopes to remove the entire tumor this time. The tumor will be genetically tested to determine what post operative treatment will combat it the best. The expectation is Sean will undergo a medical trial at National Institutes of Health in Bethesda MD--more travel expenses. A new chemotherapy drug is the other possibility. This war against brain cancer has no end  just a new battle to be won each time it invades again.The Crushing Cruelty of CancerThroughout the last 4.5 years  Sean and Sara have tried to remain optimistic  tried to just carry on like the dark clouds aren’t there. So far  Sean has been able to work. Sadly  even though they have health insurance  the high deductibles  the continuing cost of all the care  and the travel necessary to get the best of medical care have depleted all their life savings  including 401K funds. I am Sara’s mom and write this because I see the unbearable stress of unrelenting  difficult health news coupled with never ending anxiety over bills.Last April  Sara unexpectedly got pregnant just before Sean’s chemotherapy was to begin. It felt like a positive miracle to them. Sadly  the baby died in the first few months of pregnancy. Of course  there were more bills  including charges for the D &C necessary for Sara to return to good health. Life can be so hard. And yet  Sara and Sean are so grateful for the good health and happy kids they are raising through these most stressful days.Except for close friends and family  Sean and Sara have chosen to keep this journey  this fight for his life private. It’s time to ask those who know them and perhaps a few that don’t for financial help. The worry about his family’s finances and his family’s future  not to mention his own future  creates a difficult environment in which to concentrate on healing and hoping for Sean.

The road to recovery will likely be long and involve lots of care and rehabilitation  but Shyun is fighting hard  and we are all optimistic about his successful recovery.What Shyun NeedsSince coming to UCLA  Shyun has more or less supported himself  working multiple jobs to pay tuition and make ends meet. Shyun’s UCLA tuition includes health insurance that covers majority of his medical costs  but his continued coverage is dependent on his enrollment at UCLA.This is where this GoFundMe campaign comes in. Our goal is to keep Shyun enrolled at UCLA and to help pay for medical and living expenses not covered by insurance on his long road to recovery. To do so  Shyun's father  Jooho  will be establishing a trust in Shyun's name where all funds will be kept as he recovers. BackgroundShyun came to the US from Korea at the age of 7  and has continued to impact everyone he has met since. Each of us knows Shyun to be a caring friend  talented student  devoted athlete  adventurous traveler  proud son  and loving boyfriend.

As she pulled over to the side of the road  the pain intensified so much she thought she was having a heart attack. After being picked up by paramedics and rushed to the nearest hospital she finally found out her left lung collapsed. She had been in so much pain refusing all pain opioids. Once Drs put two and two together she had an infection in her lung they drained it and was going to resume all activities at home however old blood started piling out of the lung giving cause to further concern. With permission  my sister Ashley allowed them to perform a CT Scan on her left chest wall and were stunned at what they found. A large tumor sprouting from the rib and latched onto the lung. It’s easily every fist new moms worst nightmare.   Action had to be taken and they induced her into labor 6 weeks early giving birth to a beautiful baby boy named Mateo. He is truly her light and sunshine. We call him her miracle baby. After Mateo had to spend a few weeks in the NICU it was now Ashley’s turn to start the fight for her life.   She grew this rare and very large tumor unnoticed for so long  her team of Drs wanted to fight it aggressively. She had to spend one whole week as an inpatient receiving harsh chemicals and drugs upon many of the nasty side effects. This occurred every other week instead of being home bonding with the baby. In November 2016  they performed an extensive 15 hour surgery to remove her partial left lung and reconstructed her spine with lots of hardware. After 14 rounds of painfully long chemotherapy sessions away from her child  they deemed her cancer free. No longer were the days that she was told she couldn’t hold her son  no longer were the days being stuck inside because blood counts were so low. It was the best news she received. And she celebrated! By traveling  spending time with family but most importantly making a come back at work which was always the goal.   Sadly this was was all very short lived. In January 2018 she got the news the cancer had returned this time time in a different place. Back to the hospital she went  back on chemo. Trying radiation this time to come at it from a different angle. It is is now March 2019. Ashley is still in the hospital fighting for her life everyday. She most recently caught the flu and has been bedridden and throughout these many months of treatment as a single mom struggling to find childcare for Mateo; the one thing that keeps her pushing. As you can imagine hospital bills are through the roof. And we most recently learned that Ashley’s job terminated her without notice  literally having nothing to fall back on. Luckily she has great private health Insurance but the cost of living with a toddler adds up and our mother who has been pushing her self to work half time to be able to make it back in time by the evenings to help with bedtime routine. Our mother is an angel. With that being said  going forward with any donations would greatly and truly be appreciated. Ashley is the last person to ask for a handout which is why I can’t see her struggle anymore. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart  her brother Michael Gutierrez https://youtu.be/LSlTUvjjsMQ My Second Diagnosis  https://youtu.be/yt_t0xCvvOA Listening to OUR BODY"

He was placed in a medically induced coma and put on a respirator in an effort to stabilize his condition. He was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease. After not responding to treatment  his bodily functions became compromised and required dialysis. With teams of doctors on his case  he was transferred to two more hospitals as experts feverishly worked to diagnose his condition. He spent time at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Buffalo General Hospital. Howard’s body had trouble coming out of the coma  and was unable to open his eyes for 60 days. Presently  after multiple severe infections  & invasive procedures  he has been diagnosed with AML.  Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell)  red blood cells  or platelets.  This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It starts in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of certain bones  where new blood cells are made)  but most often it quickly moves into the blood  as well.

She went through five months and eight rounds of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  and a unilateral mastectomy. This August  after she had completed this treatment and during her reconstructive surgery  doctors found cancer in the lymph nodes along her sternum. The hospital told her there was less than a 2% chance of testing positive for cancer after receiving radiation and chemotherapy and having clear PET and CT scans. Molly thought she would finally be getting her life back  but instead  she has to start treatment all over again. Along with the emotional toll  she and her husband are facing impossible medical debt from her last round of treatment and anticipated costs for the next round. To get through this they need our help! Throughout her treatment this past year  Molly worked full-time amidst her fatigue  nausea  and pain in order to try and stay afloat financially. She even applied to and received a grant toward her medical expenses. She has health insurance as well as dental insurance. However  because of how expensive her treatment is -- she will be over $60K in debt after this next round of treatment from medical costs alone. She and her husband have negotiated rates down and set up payment plans where they can  but they are still not going to be able to make it through the next round of treatment without us. Her friends and family are making this go fund me for her to show our support. Any size donation is super appreciated  and for those who are not in a place to donate  we would love your help spreading the word about the fundraiser and/or any emotional support. Feel free to send a note of encouragement to her! She would love it. Love  Team Molly A Note from Molly: My name is Molly Palmison  I am 30 years old and have been living with breast cancer since July 2017. I am an Environmental Specialist living in San Antonio  TX with my beloved husband and our menagerie of pets.How this GoFundMe Will Help MeI don’t like asking for help. After my initial diagnosis I had a number of people encourage me to create a crowdfunding site to help pay for my treatment. It hurt my pride and I decided that Matthew and I could get through this on our own. Many of my initial procedures  including fertility preservation  my mastectomy  and radiation required payment in advance. I applied for multiple grants  but was denied by all but one. In the end  we put a lot of my treatments on credit cards and enrolled in hospital payment plans when available. All of my doctors seemed so optimistic at the beginning. I never thought that my condition would progress and I would need more care. Even with insurance  the bills just keep coming and it’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m drowning. I feel helpless enough living with a disease that could potentially kill me  but it’s terrifying to know that even if I live I’ll spend the rest of my life paying for a condition that was completely beyond my control.Having the weight of this financial burden off of my shoulders will give me the freedom to move on with my life. I plan to use any financial support I receive to help cover my current debt and pay for my upcoming procedures in 2019. Any unused funds will be donated to the iRise Above Foundation and Team Maggie For A Cure. HistoryBreast cancer has been a part of my life for as far back as I can remember. My mother was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 40 when I was 5 years old. Over the next decade my mother went in and out of remission before the disease finally took her life when she was 53. A part of me has always known that I would end up getting cancer; that it was a matter of when  not if. Even with that knowledge I was still shocked to be diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma at the age of 29  less than six weeks after getting married.How I Found ItI found the lump in my left breast while sitting at work one day. The underwire in my bra kept poking me so I went to the bathroom to readjust  and that’s when I found it. A hard little ball the size of a BB along my cleavage. I knew something was wrong but tried to stay positive and hope that it was just a benign cyst. I was lucky enough that my OB/GYN  was able to see me the following day. She didn’t have any appointments available for weeks  but knowing my family history she told me to come in anyway and she would find time to see me. She said that I had found a lump  along with another one that I hadn’t noticed before. From there  I underwent a mammogram  ultrasound  and biopsy before getting my official diagnosis. I have cancer. It took about two weeks from when I found the lump to receiving this life changing news. It was at the Baptist Breast Center where I met my Nurse Navigator and personal guardian angel  Andrea Kassem. She called me within an hour of my diagnosis and immediately started setting me up with a treatment plan. I am so thankful for her help. I don’t know where I would have even started looking for the appropriate doctors if she hadn’t been there to guide me.MastectomyThe first step of my journey was to undergo a unilateral mastectomy of my left breast to remove the visible cancer as quickly as possible to prevent further growth. During the surgery  the axillary nodes were tested for cancer and came back positive. In total  twenty-seven lymph nodes were removed from my left arm  armpit  and the left side of my chest to prevent the cancer from spreading. Unfortunately  this has left me with minor lymphedema as well as complete numbness in my upper arm and part of my torso. Based on the size of the malignant masses and the intrusion in my lymph nodes  I was diagnosed as Stage 3 and learned that I would need both chemotherapy and radiation. I spent the next six weeks healing from surgery and going through a whirlwind of tests and the process of fertility preservation before starting a regimen of dose dense chemo.Fertility PreservationChemotherapy  hormone therapy  and radiation can cause infertility and I was not ready to give up on the chance of someday being a mother. Fertility preservation starts out with a process similar to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) but instead of the eggs being fertilized and the embryos implanted back into the body  my embryos are in storage at a cryobank in Austin. I went through two weeks of giving myself hormone injections in the stomach and going for ultrasounds every other day. The physical toll was difficult  but it was nothing compared to the emotional ordeal of facing the reality that I may never conceive naturally or be able to carry a child at all. In addition to these struggles  my husband Matthew and I had to figure out to pay for the procedures. The state of Texas does not require insurance providers to cover fertility preservation  giving young women with fertility threatening diseases the choice of never having children  scraping the money together  or forgoing possibly life-saving treatment in favor of having a family. In total  the collection procedure and storage costs around $18 000  not including the cryobank storage fees. Matthew and I were lucky to receive a $1 500 grant from the Team Maggie for a Cure foundation as well as free medication from Livestrong  but we still had to pay the bulk of costs out of pocket. The main obstacle in paying for fertility preservation as a cancer patient is that you don’t have time to wait and save up. I had about six weeks between my mastectomy and starting chemotherapy so I had no choice but to wedge fertility preservation into the time I spent healing from surgery.After a rollercoaster of hormonal ups and downs  we were blessed with nine healthy embryos! We were told that six of them were “Grade-A.” I don’t know how I feel about our embryos being graded like chicken eggs  but good for us! Assuming we don’t decide to make our own baseball team  any unused embryos will be donated to stem cell research. ChemotherapyHaving seen my mother go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and all of its lovely side effects  I thought I knew what to expect. I was in no way prepared for the constant pain  nausea  neuropathy  and fatigue that I faced during that five month period. I had four rounds of dose-dense Adriamycin (A.K.A The Red Devil) and cyclophosphamide followed by four rounds of dose-dense Taxol and Cytoxan. I lost all of my hair after my second session of chemotherapy and started experiencing extreme bone pain and fatigue due to my white blood cell count rapidly dropping. As my physical state deteriorated it became a constant struggle just to get out of bed and face the day. I finished chemo almost a year ago and I’m still building my strength back. I go to physical therapy to combat the neuropathy I developed in my hands and feet during chemo and I feel like I’ve aged a decade. The steroids I was prescribed to deal with the side effects of Taxol were less than kind to my physique. Although I’m not out of the woods just yet  I can feel myself improving a little more each day. I’m regaining my energy  my confidence  and my drive to experience life to the fullest. RadiationAfter finishing chemotherapy  I went through five weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation was pretty easy after going through chemo. I did experience some fatigue and my skin is permanently discolored  but compared to what I had been through  it felt like I was finally getting back to feeling normal. Even with insurance  I will say that radiation wasn’t cheap. I finished treatment eight months ago and I’m still paying it off. The AftermathI had to wait a minimum of six months after radiation before having reconstructive surgery. It was a strange period of time for me. I was getting over the side effects of chemo and my body was still off-balance due to my previous mastectomy  but I no longer had constant appointments. My daily life was returning to normal but I was far from the same. One of the worst after-effects of chemotherapy is the effect that it has on teeth. My enamel was seriously damaged and my teeth had begun to erode around metal fillings that I had from when I was a child. I ended up getting two crowns and an urgent root canal for an abscessed tooth. It was really  really gross. I maxed out my dental insurance and ended up paying $1 200 out of pocket. I have two or three teeth on the other side of my mouth that also need work but I’m waiting for my dental insurance to rollover in January. I had quite a few cavities when I was a child  but up until recently I hadn’t had any dental issues for over a decade. This whole ordeal was a very unexpected and unwelcome surprise.ReconstructionA little over one year after having a left-side mastectomy  I underwent a prophylactic mastectomy of my right breast and full Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction  which uses skin and fat tissue from my abdomen to create new breasts. I spent several days in the hospital recovering and was unable to drive for about a month. I also developed deep vein thrombosis when a blood clot formed in the calf of my left leg. It hurt but luckily it wasn’t in a dangerous area so I just have to take blood thinners for a few months.In addition to breast reconstruction  I also had lymph node transfer surgery to replace the lymph nodes that had previously been removed from my arm and armpit. The goal of this procedure is to repair the lymphatic system and minimize the risk of lymphedema. It has been three months since surgery and I’m still healing  but overall it’s nice to have a body that’s halfway symmetrical. I will be having a follow-up surgery sometime next year to fix any imperfections resulting from the initial reconstructive surgery.It’s BackDuring the reconstructive surgery  two of the lymph nodes along my sternum were removed. Due to my previous diagnosis  they were sent for laboratory analysis and one came back positive for cancer. I was told by my surgical oncologist. He performed my original mastectomy as well as the prophylactic mastectomy I had before reconstruction. I went to his office on my lunch break for what I thought would be a fifteen post-op checkup. When he broke the news to me I felt like my reality was crumbling  crashing in on itself. My doctor hugged me while I cried and assured me that everything would be alright. I believe him. Prior to surgery I had undergone a PET scan and a CT scan  both of which showed no evidence of disease. I was completely blindsided by my new diagnosis. I thought I was done. I just want it to be over. My new diagnosis also came with a little over $8 000 in bills for the lymph node biopsy and tests that were not able to be approved with my insurance company prior to the procedure. I’ve been told that I had less than a 2% chance of still testing positive for breast cancer after going through chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It’s disappointing to say the least (more like earth shattering)  but at least I can be proactive instead of having it fester inside of me. I have faced this obstacle before and I can do it again. Because the cancer cells were found in my lymph nodes  I am still considered to have Stage 3 breast cancer. It has not metastasized and with proper treatment and self-care I may still overcome this obstacle. I will not let this slow me down. I have a life to live and i refuse to let this hold me back.Round TwoSince receiving this news I am back to my hectic schedule of appointments  scans  tests  and physical therapy along with working a full-time job. Life is crazy but it’s good to stay busy. I am now on hormone therapy that induces early menopause and will be starting radiation again next week. This time I will be having 26 rounds of localized radiation in the area where the cancer was found during my reconstruction surgery. Because this area of my chest is directly over my heart there is a chance that it could affect my cardiovascular system  but hopefully that won’t be the case. I am hoping to be done with radiation before the New Year. After radiation it is likely that I will be going on some kind of oral chemotherapy for a few years.I’m not as scared this time. I know what to expect and I know what I need to do in order to deal with radiation side effects. Oddly enough  the part I’m dreading most is having to use the lotion that I’m prescribed to keep my skin healthy during treatment. The smell of it immediately reminds me of being sick. In addition to further medical treatment  I am working toward making lifestyle changes to improve my health and help my body to heal itself as much as possible. I am transitioning to a plant based diet  exercising more  connecting more with others  and taking care of myself as much as possible. I am making my health a priority and I am determined to do whatever it takes to keep thriving."

Devastated  Greg was kept in the ER overnight then transferred to the oncology department where he was monitored for rest of the week while waiting for his brain biopsy.  The evening of November 1st  Greg had a successful biopsy procedure and the tissue was sent away for testing.  Greg recovered in ICU until he was released the following evening with seizure medication  etc. Greg was home and starting to feel like himself again until November 6th when he had his 2nd and 3rd seizure in his sleep.  Paramedics helped him out of his 3rd seizure  and Greg woke up in the ER yet again.  The week proceeding  Greg began having multiple focal seizure and confusion spells a day.  The seizures slowly went away as his medication became therapeutic.  Finally  on November 21st  the long awaited biopsy results were in; Malignant Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II - IDH mutation).  Now it’s go time.  On top of everything  Greg could be facing losing his job due to his time away which would mean losing his health insurance.  He’s attempting to go back to work to keep his health insurance  but can only do so much with the memory loss and headaches he’s experiencing.  Christy is working and taking care of Greg with the help of family and friends.  Because Greg and Christy recently moved to the Sacramento area  they haven’t been at their jobs long enough to qualify for FMLA.  Any support in anyway that you would be able to offer the Kellers while they’re going through this would be incredibly appreciated.  All donations will go towards Greg’s mounting medical care."

Some say: COBRA? I couldn’t afford THAT.) COBRA means you have insurance  but there’s a large payment due each month  compared to an employer-sponsored plan. Barry and Morry have friends and family who love them  and are working to provide the support they need as they figure out What Happens Next. The first thing we’d like to do is to make sure that their rent  COBRA and co-pays/prescriptions are covered for the next three months. That’s why we started this GoFundMe. In addition  we’re working to find out more about other means of support  and ways for them to be able to focus on getting Barry healthy again. We hope you’ll consider helping Barry and Morry keep the rent and insurance paid. Since their chosen family includes many artists and other working people who live from paycheck to paycheck  we understand if it’s not possible now. Good wishes  prayers  cards  jokes and pictures of cute animals are also gratefully accepted. We are committed to supporting our friend through this part of his journey  and look forward to updating you with good news. With much love  Team BarryKathleen Warnock  Donna Bungo  Dawn Jackson  Teresa Campbell  Karia Campbell  Michael Zegarski"

I am having another MRI next month to see if it has continued to grow. Fingers crossed that it has not. This cancer is a very long journey  but your prayers  kind words  and support have uplifted and inspired me beyond what I can put into words. Thank you from the depth of my heart... Kelly ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To everyone who has read my story  sent prayers and love  and donated to this life saving fund  I thank you from the depths of my being. My body is severely compromised by this painful cancer  but my heart has grown in gratitude and thanksgiving for all who have cared and shared in some beautiful form. Many of you I don’t even know in person  but your kindness and generosity have expanded me beyond what I could have imagined. Thank you all for being an integral  soul-moving part of my journey and giving me the experience of how profoundly I am not alone. I am humbled.Medically my battle continues. In spite of the heavy-duty drugs I am taking  my cancer appears to be further metastasizing. My cancer markers are up  and the intense pain I had before diagnosis is back. It’s a protracted journey  but I am strong. With the help of God  my medical team  and everyone who has touched my life  I absolutely trust that I will find a way to kick cancer’s butt.Thank you for sharing my story. Thank you for your continued support in any way that is right for you. Thank you for you.Blessings always… Kelly~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A friend and donor to Kelly’s GoFundMe campaign shared this post with her Friends and we’d like to share it with you!\"I am asking for a friend who is fighting a valiant fight against breast cancer and a myriad of related challenges. If you've been blessed with a little extra or are willing to give up a latte/cocktail/splurge  perhaps you will consider helping Kelly with her expenses. Think of it as a deposit in your bank of karma...and thank you. \" MY URGENT BATTLE WITH RELENTLESS INVASIVE BREAST CANCERMy name is Kelly VanEck I wish I didn’t need help right now  but I do  and my need is imminent. On May 24  2018 I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. My cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. It is relentless. Complications have resulted in my having five non-reconstructive surgeries in four months plus extensive and very expensive testing  radiation  and alternate treatments which my doctors have ordered.There is no bottom line answer for the kind of invasive breast cancer that I have. I will be in continuous treatment for at least 5 years  and complications from that treatment have already affected my body  resulting in additional surgeries. Lousy insurance  which has put me in a position to have to fight to get approval for things like diagnostic CT scans and infusions that can save my life  makes everything even more devastating. I have been turned down for essential procedures at the admitting desk of a lab or hospital because I did not have the cash. That’s almost as scary as the cancer.  Unfortunately  my husband and I find ourselves caught in the black hole between making too much money to qualify for Medicaid or any of the foundations that give assistance to cancer patients  and not making enough money to afford good insurance. The only way I could qualify would be if I quit my job which would make financial and emotional pressures worse.I must have the infusions  MRIs  and daily medication in order to live  but I am dealing with horrible insurance which will soon require another massive deductible to pay the parts it does pay. I do not have it. The uncovered expenses are overwhelming.My family and I have exhausted every financial resource we have  and yet my need for life saving treatment is far from over. Without the funds for those treatments and better health insurance I will not survive.My mom had cancer twice  so I was meticulous about staying current with medical exams. I started having pain on the left side of my chest about 2 years ago. The doctors couldn’t find any reason for it even though the pain continued and started to escalate. And then along came Hank  my rescue cat. Hank had been abused so the first many months that he lived with us were all about helping him feel safe. He became more secure  confident  and actually cuddly. He began to come up on the bed at night and snuggle with me. Shortly thereafter he started to do something odd. He would gently paw at my left breast and then simply lay his head on it and fall asleep. He never tried to sleep on any other part of my body  yet he repeated this action nightly. It took a while  before I finally had an epiphany! I had heard  but never seen  that animals can detect cancer. Suddenly I realized that I had spent months trying to talk myself out of something that I knew deep inside of me  but was too afraid to face. I went back into the medical community and said something is wrong. Please help me find what it is. They finally found it but the cancer had already metastasized. And that’s how Hank  this beautiful little gift from God  who had been cruelly used and abused in his early years  and somehow managed to live  made sure that I would have a chance to survive this rogue cancer.What’s NextMy cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. So I’m on the five year plan. My first surgery for this illness was June 8  2018. My fifth surgery was four months later on October 9  2018. I will be having infusions every month for the next 5 years along with accompanying MRIs  lab work  and other medications. Hopefully  research will create greater breakthroughs during this time.Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and being willing to share it. Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts. And  if it works for you  I thank you for your donations. All of them will go toward medical expenses. I promise you I will spend the rest of my life paying your kindness and generosity forward. I am forever grateful.This is where I was physically and energetically  this is where I have faith I will be again. #iamHOPE"
"Medical","January 12, 2019","Move Mountains For Danielle Mumm","$31,901","$150,000","220","3","219","1.3k","SEATTLE","WA","On December 26th  2018  Danielle “Danny” Mumm  a perfectly healthy 19-year-old athlete  suffered a sudden cardiac arrest in the mountains near Seattle.Danny Mumm  one of five siblings  has been an elite and passionate soccer player most of her young life. Her freshman year of college  she played soccer for Montana State Billings (MSUB) and transferred to Grand Canyon University (GCU) this year.  The very picture of health  she had never displayed any signs of a congenital weakness in her heart. On the day after Christmas  all that changed. While tubing with her family at Snoqualmie Pass  suddenly she didn't feel well and passed out in the snow. She stopped breathing and had no pulse.Miraculously  after critical minutes passed  there was a nurse that happened to be at the mountain tubing as well  who began performing CPR until ski patrol  and subsequent medics finally arrived. Once the medics arrived  they immediately \"shocked\" her with a defibrillator  but it was clear that her life was touch-and-go. She had to be shocked again on the way and once she arrived in Emergency.  After 24 hours in ICU at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue  despite everything the doctors could do  her heart and overall condition continued to worsen.  The doctors at Overlake consulted with the University of Washington Medical Center  and decided they needed to move her to UWMC and place her on a life-saving ECMO machine; a medical marvel that did the work of Danielle's heart and lungs so she could fight for her life and let her heart and major organs recover. And praise be to God  it worked! After 4 days on the ECMO machine  Danny’s cardiac and pulmonary functions gradually restored  and her life was miraculously spared. The word “miracle” is often used lightly.  But in this case  it is the only word to describe what happened.Just as incredibly  Danny shows no sign of cognitive damage. \"She is the same sweet  loving and precious Danny \" says her father  John. And although she has a long  very difficult road ahead of her  she will survive against all odds  by the Grace of our Heavenly Father.The challenges ahead on this long road to recovery will be enormous. Because Danny was without effective cardiac function for an extended period  and had to be placed on so many vascular constricting drugs to stay alive  the lack of circulation to her extremities caused considerable tissue and nerve damage.  The resulting ‘compartment syndrome in both lower legs and her left arm have required fasciotomy surgeries  the results of which will take time to fully determine. We are all praying for full circulation to return to her feet and further miraculous recovery. Danny will soon begin intensive inpatient physical therapy as she works towards a full recovery.Danny is a fighter  and despite all she’s been through  her spirits are high  her eyes shine and she continues to amaze and inspire the doctors and other health care providers with her recovery and attitude. She remains a light in the room.Her family has surrounded her with loving care. Her room is decorated with pictures  inspirational verses and well wishes from family and friends.  Tens of thousands  literally around the world have been praying for Danny. Her courage in the face of enormous trials and complications have touched so many hearts. So many have asked what they can do and how they can help.  For those that would like to make any kind of financial contributions towards the enormous medical and long term rehabilitation expenses  this GoFundMe page provides that opportunity.  The Mumm family would like to thanks everyone for their thoughts  prayers and any kind of help you would like to provide. While the Mumm family has health insurance  the costs are enormous – and the intensive life-saving care and rehabilitation comes with a big price tag.Please share this with everyone you know. Together  we can move mountains for Danny!“Truly I tell you  if anyone says to a mountain  ‘Go throw yourself into the sea ’ and does not doubt in their heart  but believes… it will be done for them.”                                                      -  Jesus Christ  Mark 11:23"

That night  their 13-year-old son  Sean Luca started complaining of a headache  and began acting in a very agitated and confused manner. He was hyperactive  and fixated on tiny details for extended periods of time. Having no idea what was going on  over the next few days  he met with neurologists  psychiatrists  and psychologists  and had a CT scan of the brain  an MRI  MRA  multiple EEGs  and lots and lots of blood work.On December 15th  Sean Luca had to be admitted to the hospital because his headaches were still so severe  and he spent 5 nights as an inpatient until his headache finally broke. He was released from hospital on medication and was generally ok for almost two weeks. Then the headaches came back.  This pattern of multi-day headaches followed by periods of breakthrough continued for a few months. At the time  he was given a diagnosis of atypical confusional migraines onset by puberty. He missed several months of school.  But Dave and Domenica knew something still wasn’t right.  He exhibited an array of symptoms which varied from day-to-day  and sometimes from minute-to-minute. These included obsessive-compulsive behavior  verbal and physical tics  anxiety attacks  irritability  mood swings  reclusive behavior  temper tantrums  immature behavior  difficulty with attention and concentration  hyperactivity  oppositional behavior  and becoming suddenly overwhelmed with different situations  completely out of the blue. Over time  his headaches began to wane in frequency  but these other symptoms were becoming more common.  The treatments he was getting didn’t seem to be working.At the beginning of June  2018--seven months after his symptoms began and after countless tests and doctor’s visits--he finally got a diagnosis: Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (“PANS”). This is still a relatively new diagnosis  and there are few experts in the country. If you would like to learn more about PANS  please watch “Brain on Fire” on Netflix.  A team in St. Petersburg  FL started to treat Sean Luca with an extended course of antibiotics and they saw some initial improvement. As a part of the treatment  he was admitted to Miami Children’s Hospital for a two-day treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”). After that treatment Sean Luca reported that he was finally feeling well.  He felt so well that he was able to go back to school in August and had an amazing first week.  He handled the back-to-school rigors with ease and resumed the activities he once loved.  Dave and Domenica thought the nightmare they had been living was over. But  just 10 short days after his symptoms disappeared  they were back.  And they haven’t gone away since.   In late August  Sean was seen by the preeminent expert on PANS  who is located in New York.   Writing about Sean Luca  that doctor recently wrote  “symptoms continue to progress and are severely affecting his life quality. This bright young boy is being affected by a condition that can be treated. In fact  without proper treatment  symptoms will continue to progress and eventually become permanent and irreversible.” The specialist ultimately recommended ongoing IVIG treatment for at least three months.  Sean Luca is currently in the process of receiving that treatment.Now that Sean Luca is doing a little better  he is more aware of his situation. And  that awareness is frankly a setback.  He is stressed about missing school.  You see  he hasn’t actually been to school since August 20th  and was recently enrolled in the Hospital Homebound program so that he can catch up on school work once he feels better.  He may or may not be able to complete eighth grade.  Every calendar update on his phone when he misses a voice lesson  an audition  or even “test prep” upsets him by reminding him what he’s missing. He cries himself to sleep most nights asking  “why me?” or “when will this go away?”  Those questions are painful for a parent to hear and gut wrenching to try to answer when you don’t have an answer.  When people ask how he’s doing  it is difficult for Dave and Domenica to answer. On the one hand  he’s doing so much better. Unfortunately  he doesn’t feel better. He still exhibits most of his PANS symptoms  and still struggles with elements of everyday functioning.  There are brief periods where Dave and Domenica see glimpses of the old Sean Luca:  a kind  funny  and empathetic kid who loves to sing and to serve his community.  Unfortunately  those times are short lived.   Doctors can’t really say when he might expect to see a return to his old self.  Their stock answer has been that “every patient is different.” They are encouraged at the forward momentum that he has experienced even though it is slow.  Sean Luca’s medical bills have amounted to more than $750 000 since this nightmare began.  And  despite the fact that IVIG is the only treatment that has worked for him  the family’s health insurance company refused to approve the treatment for him.Dave and Domenica  along with his doctors  filed a grievance against the insurance company. After a very protracted fight  the State of California  where the insurance company is based  eventually ruled in their favor.  Even taking into account the favorable ruling regarding the insurance  they will be out-of-pocket by more than $150 000 since Sean Luca’s symptoms began last year.Many of you know Dave and Domenica.  If you do  you know that they are some of the most kind  generous people there are.  What they have gone through in the past year is something that no one should have to endure.  This has been devastating to them both financially and emotionally.  Their strength has been extraordinary  but they could really use some help to overcome the financial and mental burden this has caused.  So  I ask you:  Please  if you can spare a few dollars during this season of giving  please do so.  No amount is too small but anything you can contribute would be so meaningful to Dave and Domenica.  Let’s make a difference in this beautiful family’s life."

However  on the night of January 6th  Tahia became violently ill  after which she fell into a coma on January 7th and was admitted to the ICU and put on life support. The doctors diagnosed her with brain encephalopathy  being unable to pinpoint a single specific cause for the severe reaction and subsequent internal brain injury.After consulting with the doctors  family members  and consultants from other hospitals in Bangladesh  a decision had been made that in order for Tahia to receive the best immediate care to save her life and treat her condition  she had to be taken to Bumrungrad Hospital in Thailand.

Despite everything  Tahia continues to show a tremendous amount of strength and perseverance towards her recovery with her parents and family members by her side. Currently  she is still being treated at Bumrungrad  as her parents are making plans to transfer her back to the states once she is in a stable condition to make the journey back.

He was unable to breathe on his own  his symptoms worsened  and within 24 hours he was moved to the ICU. He was placed in a medically induced coma and put on a respirator in an effort to stabilize his condition. He was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease. After not responding to treatment  his bodily functions became compromised and required dialysis. With teams of doctors on his case  he was transferred to two more hospitals as experts feverishly worked to diagnose his condition. He spent time at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Buffalo General Hospital. Howard’s body had trouble coming out of the coma  and was unable to open his eyes for 60 days. Presently  after multiple severe infections  & invasive procedures  he has been diagnosed with AML.  Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell)  red blood cells  or platelets.  This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It starts in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of certain bones  where new blood cells are made)  but most often it quickly moves into the blood  as well.

In order to determine the severity of his cancer and receive a treatment plan  he’s had to travel back to his hometown in France. As most of you may know timing is everything when it comes to cancer.Initially  Guillaume was scheduled to have his tumor removed through surgery. However  after arriving in France and seeking further medical evaluation  it was discovered that his cancer is stage 4. The 5mm tumor that was to be removed in his colon has tripled in size to 15mm and spread to his liver within just a few weeks.The new goal is to shrink the tumor as much as possible through treatment so that it can be removed without any further spreading. In order to do this  he needs to return to the United States to obtain treatment at UPenn’s oncology center.Sadly  Guillaume’s current health insurance policy offers only minimal coverage. His fight will be costly in more ways that one. Guillaume is unable to work as he’s had to relocate to France and his 2019 monthly insurance fees and deductible will be astronomical. But we can help. Any donation towards Guillaume’s treatment is truly appreciated.Please feel free to reach out to Francisca Soto  TK Kelly  Anthony Prano  David Darami  Christiana Barile  or Katie Shelburn with any questions or to find out additional ways you can help.

She went through five months and eight rounds of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  and a unilateral mastectomy. This August  after she had completed this treatment and during her reconstructive surgery  doctors found cancer in the lymph nodes along her sternum. The hospital told her there was less than a 2% chance of testing positive for cancer after receiving radiation and chemotherapy and having clear PET and CT scans. Molly thought she would finally be getting her life back  but instead  she has to start treatment all over again. Along with the emotional toll  she and her husband are facing impossible medical debt from her last round of treatment and anticipated costs for the next round. To get through this they need our help! Throughout her treatment this past year  Molly worked full-time amidst her fatigue  nausea  and pain in order to try and stay afloat financially. She even applied to and received a grant toward her medical expenses. She has health insurance as well as dental insurance. However  because of how expensive her treatment is -- she will be over $60K in debt after this next round of treatment from medical costs alone. She and her husband have negotiated rates down and set up payment plans where they can  but they are still not going to be able to make it through the next round of treatment without us. Her friends and family are making this go fund me for her to show our support. Any size donation is super appreciated  and for those who are not in a place to donate  we would love your help spreading the word about the fundraiser and/or any emotional support. Feel free to send a note of encouragement to her! She would love it. Love  Team Molly A Note from Molly: My name is Molly Palmison  I am 30 years old and have been living with breast cancer since July 2017. I am an Environmental Specialist living in San Antonio  TX with my beloved husband and our menagerie of pets.How this GoFundMe Will Help MeI don’t like asking for help. After my initial diagnosis I had a number of people encourage me to create a crowdfunding site to help pay for my treatment. It hurt my pride and I decided that Matthew and I could get through this on our own. Many of my initial procedures  including fertility preservation  my mastectomy  and radiation required payment in advance. I applied for multiple grants  but was denied by all but one. In the end  we put a lot of my treatments on credit cards and enrolled in hospital payment plans when available. All of my doctors seemed so optimistic at the beginning. I never thought that my condition would progress and I would need more care. Even with insurance  the bills just keep coming and it’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m drowning. I feel helpless enough living with a disease that could potentially kill me  but it’s terrifying to know that even if I live I’ll spend the rest of my life paying for a condition that was completely beyond my control.Having the weight of this financial burden off of my shoulders will give me the freedom to move on with my life. I plan to use any financial support I receive to help cover my current debt and pay for my upcoming procedures in 2019. Any unused funds will be donated to the iRise Above Foundation and Team Maggie For A Cure. HistoryBreast cancer has been a part of my life for as far back as I can remember. My mother was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 40 when I was 5 years old. Over the next decade my mother went in and out of remission before the disease finally took her life when she was 53. A part of me has always known that I would end up getting cancer; that it was a matter of when  not if. Even with that knowledge I was still shocked to be diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma at the age of 29  less than six weeks after getting married.How I Found ItI found the lump in my left breast while sitting at work one day. The underwire in my bra kept poking me so I went to the bathroom to readjust  and that’s when I found it. A hard little ball the size of a BB along my cleavage. I knew something was wrong but tried to stay positive and hope that it was just a benign cyst. I was lucky enough that my OB/GYN  was able to see me the following day. She didn’t have any appointments available for weeks  but knowing my family history she told me to come in anyway and she would find time to see me. She said that I had found a lump  along with another one that I hadn’t noticed before. From there  I underwent a mammogram  ultrasound  and biopsy before getting my official diagnosis. I have cancer. It took about two weeks from when I found the lump to receiving this life changing news. It was at the Baptist Breast Center where I met my Nurse Navigator and personal guardian angel  Andrea Kassem. She called me within an hour of my diagnosis and immediately started setting me up with a treatment plan. I am so thankful for her help. I don’t know where I would have even started looking for the appropriate doctors if she hadn’t been there to guide me.MastectomyThe first step of my journey was to undergo a unilateral mastectomy of my left breast to remove the visible cancer as quickly as possible to prevent further growth. During the surgery  the axillary nodes were tested for cancer and came back positive. In total  twenty-seven lymph nodes were removed from my left arm  armpit  and the left side of my chest to prevent the cancer from spreading. Unfortunately  this has left me with minor lymphedema as well as complete numbness in my upper arm and part of my torso. Based on the size of the malignant masses and the intrusion in my lymph nodes  I was diagnosed as Stage 3 and learned that I would need both chemotherapy and radiation. I spent the next six weeks healing from surgery and going through a whirlwind of tests and the process of fertility preservation before starting a regimen of dose dense chemo.Fertility PreservationChemotherapy  hormone therapy  and radiation can cause infertility and I was not ready to give up on the chance of someday being a mother. Fertility preservation starts out with a process similar to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) but instead of the eggs being fertilized and the embryos implanted back into the body  my embryos are in storage at a cryobank in Austin. I went through two weeks of giving myself hormone injections in the stomach and going for ultrasounds every other day. The physical toll was difficult  but it was nothing compared to the emotional ordeal of facing the reality that I may never conceive naturally or be able to carry a child at all. In addition to these struggles  my husband Matthew and I had to figure out to pay for the procedures. The state of Texas does not require insurance providers to cover fertility preservation  giving young women with fertility threatening diseases the choice of never having children  scraping the money together  or forgoing possibly life-saving treatment in favor of having a family. In total  the collection procedure and storage costs around $18 000  not including the cryobank storage fees. Matthew and I were lucky to receive a $1 500 grant from the Team Maggie for a Cure foundation as well as free medication from Livestrong  but we still had to pay the bulk of costs out of pocket. The main obstacle in paying for fertility preservation as a cancer patient is that you don’t have time to wait and save up. I had about six weeks between my mastectomy and starting chemotherapy so I had no choice but to wedge fertility preservation into the time I spent healing from surgery.After a rollercoaster of hormonal ups and downs  we were blessed with nine healthy embryos! We were told that six of them were “Grade-A.” I don’t know how I feel about our embryos being graded like chicken eggs  but good for us! Assuming we don’t decide to make our own baseball team  any unused embryos will be donated to stem cell research. ChemotherapyHaving seen my mother go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and all of its lovely side effects  I thought I knew what to expect. I was in no way prepared for the constant pain  nausea  neuropathy  and fatigue that I faced during that five month period. I had four rounds of dose-dense Adriamycin (A.K.A The Red Devil) and cyclophosphamide followed by four rounds of dose-dense Taxol and Cytoxan. I lost all of my hair after my second session of chemotherapy and started experiencing extreme bone pain and fatigue due to my white blood cell count rapidly dropping. As my physical state deteriorated it became a constant struggle just to get out of bed and face the day. I finished chemo almost a year ago and I’m still building my strength back. I go to physical therapy to combat the neuropathy I developed in my hands and feet during chemo and I feel like I’ve aged a decade. The steroids I was prescribed to deal with the side effects of Taxol were less than kind to my physique. Although I’m not out of the woods just yet  I can feel myself improving a little more each day. I’m regaining my energy  my confidence  and my drive to experience life to the fullest. RadiationAfter finishing chemotherapy  I went through five weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation was pretty easy after going through chemo. I did experience some fatigue and my skin is permanently discolored  but compared to what I had been through  it felt like I was finally getting back to feeling normal. Even with insurance  I will say that radiation wasn’t cheap. I finished treatment eight months ago and I’m still paying it off. The AftermathI had to wait a minimum of six months after radiation before having reconstructive surgery. It was a strange period of time for me. I was getting over the side effects of chemo and my body was still off-balance due to my previous mastectomy  but I no longer had constant appointments. My daily life was returning to normal but I was far from the same. One of the worst after-effects of chemotherapy is the effect that it has on teeth. My enamel was seriously damaged and my teeth had begun to erode around metal fillings that I had from when I was a child. I ended up getting two crowns and an urgent root canal for an abscessed tooth. It was really  really gross. I maxed out my dental insurance and ended up paying $1 200 out of pocket. I have two or three teeth on the other side of my mouth that also need work but I’m waiting for my dental insurance to rollover in January. I had quite a few cavities when I was a child  but up until recently I hadn’t had any dental issues for over a decade. This whole ordeal was a very unexpected and unwelcome surprise.ReconstructionA little over one year after having a left-side mastectomy  I underwent a prophylactic mastectomy of my right breast and full Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction  which uses skin and fat tissue from my abdomen to create new breasts. I spent several days in the hospital recovering and was unable to drive for about a month. I also developed deep vein thrombosis when a blood clot formed in the calf of my left leg. It hurt but luckily it wasn’t in a dangerous area so I just have to take blood thinners for a few months.In addition to breast reconstruction  I also had lymph node transfer surgery to replace the lymph nodes that had previously been removed from my arm and armpit. The goal of this procedure is to repair the lymphatic system and minimize the risk of lymphedema. It has been three months since surgery and I’m still healing  but overall it’s nice to have a body that’s halfway symmetrical. I will be having a follow-up surgery sometime next year to fix any imperfections resulting from the initial reconstructive surgery.It’s BackDuring the reconstructive surgery  two of the lymph nodes along my sternum were removed. Due to my previous diagnosis  they were sent for laboratory analysis and one came back positive for cancer. I was told by my surgical oncologist. He performed my original mastectomy as well as the prophylactic mastectomy I had before reconstruction. I went to his office on my lunch break for what I thought would be a fifteen post-op checkup. When he broke the news to me I felt like my reality was crumbling  crashing in on itself. My doctor hugged me while I cried and assured me that everything would be alright. I believe him. Prior to surgery I had undergone a PET scan and a CT scan  both of which showed no evidence of disease. I was completely blindsided by my new diagnosis. I thought I was done. I just want it to be over. My new diagnosis also came with a little over $8 000 in bills for the lymph node biopsy and tests that were not able to be approved with my insurance company prior to the procedure. I’ve been told that I had less than a 2% chance of still testing positive for breast cancer after going through chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It’s disappointing to say the least (more like earth shattering)  but at least I can be proactive instead of having it fester inside of me. I have faced this obstacle before and I can do it again. Because the cancer cells were found in my lymph nodes  I am still considered to have Stage 3 breast cancer. It has not metastasized and with proper treatment and self-care I may still overcome this obstacle. I will not let this slow me down. I have a life to live and i refuse to let this hold me back.Round TwoSince receiving this news I am back to my hectic schedule of appointments  scans  tests  and physical therapy along with working a full-time job. Life is crazy but it’s good to stay busy. I am now on hormone therapy that induces early menopause and will be starting radiation again next week. This time I will be having 26 rounds of localized radiation in the area where the cancer was found during my reconstruction surgery. Because this area of my chest is directly over my heart there is a chance that it could affect my cardiovascular system  but hopefully that won’t be the case. I am hoping to be done with radiation before the New Year. After radiation it is likely that I will be going on some kind of oral chemotherapy for a few years.I’m not as scared this time. I know what to expect and I know what I need to do in order to deal with radiation side effects. Oddly enough  the part I’m dreading most is having to use the lotion that I’m prescribed to keep my skin healthy during treatment. The smell of it immediately reminds me of being sick. In addition to further medical treatment  I am working toward making lifestyle changes to improve my health and help my body to heal itself as much as possible. I am transitioning to a plant based diet  exercising more  connecting more with others  and taking care of myself as much as possible. I am making my health a priority and I am determined to do whatever it takes to keep thriving."

Greg is a candidate for brain surgery to remove the tumor  then radiation and chemotherapy to follow.  He was referred to a neurosurgeon at UCSF that’s supposed to be the best of the best for this diagnosis.  He was simultaneously referred for another MRI to see how the cancer has progressed.  There are still many unanswered questions and consultations with specialists waiting to be scheduled. Everything began when Greg had a seizure out of the blue on October 27th.  His wife  Christy was able to call 911 and Greg was taken by ambulance to Sutter hospital within minutes.  Greg was coherent at the hospital but confused.  A CT scan was taken which showed a dark area in the right frontal lobe of his brain.  This called for an MRI.  After anxiously waiting for hours in the ER  the results came back confirming a mass in his brain. Devastated  Greg was kept in the ER overnight then transferred to the oncology department where he was monitored for rest of the week while waiting for his brain biopsy.  The evening of November 1st  Greg had a successful biopsy procedure and the tissue was sent away for testing.  Greg recovered in ICU until he was released the following evening with seizure medication  etc. Greg was home and starting to feel like himself again until November 6th when he had his 2nd and 3rd seizure in his sleep.  Paramedics helped him out of his 3rd seizure  and Greg woke up in the ER yet again.  The week proceeding  Greg began having multiple focal seizure and confusion spells a day.  The seizures slowly went away as his medication became therapeutic.  Finally  on November 21st  the long awaited biopsy results were in; Malignant Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II - IDH mutation).  Now it’s go time.  On top of everything  Greg could be facing losing his job due to his time away which would mean losing his health insurance.  He’s attempting to go back to work to keep his health insurance  but can only do so much with the memory loss and headaches he’s experiencing.  Christy is working and taking care of Greg with the help of family and friends.  Because Greg and Christy recently moved to the Sacramento area  they haven’t been at their jobs long enough to qualify for FMLA.  Any support in anyway that you would be able to offer the Kellers while they’re going through this would be incredibly appreciated.  All donations will go towards Greg’s mounting medical care."

On May 24  2018 I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. My cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. It is relentless. Complications have resulted in my having five non-reconstructive surgeries in four months plus extensive and very expensive testing  radiation  and alternate treatments which my doctors have ordered.There is no bottom line answer for the kind of invasive breast cancer that I have. I will be in continuous treatment for at least 5 years  and complications from that treatment have already affected my body  resulting in additional surgeries. Lousy insurance  which has put me in a position to have to fight to get approval for things like diagnostic CT scans and infusions that can save my life  makes everything even more devastating. I have been turned down for essential procedures at the admitting desk of a lab or hospital because I did not have the cash. That’s almost as scary as the cancer.  Unfortunately  my husband and I find ourselves caught in the black hole between making too much money to qualify for Medicaid or any of the foundations that give assistance to cancer patients  and not making enough money to afford good insurance. The only way I could qualify would be if I quit my job which would make financial and emotional pressures worse.I must have the infusions  MRIs  and daily medication in order to live  but I am dealing with horrible insurance which will soon require another massive deductible to pay the parts it does pay. I do not have it. The uncovered expenses are overwhelming.My family and I have exhausted every financial resource we have  and yet my need for life saving treatment is far from over. Without the funds for those treatments and better health insurance I will not survive.My mom had cancer twice  so I was meticulous about staying current with medical exams. I started having pain on the left side of my chest about 2 years ago. The doctors couldn’t find any reason for it even though the pain continued and started to escalate. And then along came Hank  my rescue cat. Hank had been abused so the first many months that he lived with us were all about helping him feel safe. He became more secure  confident  and actually cuddly. He began to come up on the bed at night and snuggle with me. Shortly thereafter he started to do something odd. He would gently paw at my left breast and then simply lay his head on it and fall asleep. He never tried to sleep on any other part of my body  yet he repeated this action nightly. It took a while  before I finally had an epiphany! I had heard  but never seen  that animals can detect cancer. Suddenly I realized that I had spent months trying to talk myself out of something that I knew deep inside of me  but was too afraid to face. I went back into the medical community and said something is wrong. Please help me find what it is. They finally found it but the cancer had already metastasized. And that’s how Hank  this beautiful little gift from God  who had been cruelly used and abused in his early years  and somehow managed to live  made sure that I would have a chance to survive this rogue cancer.What’s NextMy cancer does not respond to traditional chemo. So I’m on the five year plan. My first surgery for this illness was June 8  2018. My fifth surgery was four months later on October 9  2018. I will be having infusions every month for the next 5 years along with accompanying MRIs  lab work  and other medications. Hopefully  research will create greater breakthroughs during this time.Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and being willing to share it. Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts. And  if it works for you  I thank you for your donations. All of them will go toward medical expenses. I promise you I will spend the rest of my life paying your kindness and generosity forward. I am forever grateful.This is where I was physically and energetically  this is where I have faith I will be again. #iamHOPE"

Her freshman year of college  she played soccer for Montana State Billings (MSUB) and transferred to Grand Canyon University (GCU) this year.  The very picture of health  she had never displayed any signs of a congenital weakness in her heart. On the day after Christmas  all that changed. While tubing with her family at Snoqualmie Pass  suddenly she didn't feel well and passed out in the snow. She stopped breathing and had no pulse.Miraculously  after critical minutes passed  there was a nurse that happened to be at the mountain tubing as well  who began performing CPR until ski patrol  and subsequent medics finally arrived. Once the medics arrived  they immediately \"shocked\" her with a defibrillator  but it was clear that her life was touch-and-go. She had to be shocked again on the way and once she arrived in Emergency.  After 24 hours in ICU at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue  despite everything the doctors could do  her heart and overall condition continued to worsen.  The doctors at Overlake consulted with the University of Washington Medical Center  and decided they needed to move her to UWMC and place her on a life-saving ECMO machine; a medical marvel that did the work of Danielle's heart and lungs so she could fight for her life and let her heart and major organs recover. And praise be to God  it worked! After 4 days on the ECMO machine  Danny’s cardiac and pulmonary functions gradually restored  and her life was miraculously spared. The word “miracle” is often used lightly.  But in this case  it is the only word to describe what happened.Just as incredibly  Danny shows no sign of cognitive damage. \"She is the same sweet  loving and precious Danny \" says her father  John. And although she has a long  very difficult road ahead of her  she will survive against all odds  by the Grace of our Heavenly Father.The challenges ahead on this long road to recovery will be enormous. Because Danny was without effective cardiac function for an extended period  and had to be placed on so many vascular constricting drugs to stay alive  the lack of circulation to her extremities caused considerable tissue and nerve damage.  The resulting ‘compartment syndrome in both lower legs and her left arm have required fasciotomy surgeries  the results of which will take time to fully determine. We are all praying for full circulation to return to her feet and further miraculous recovery. Danny will soon begin intensive inpatient physical therapy as she works towards a full recovery.Danny is a fighter  and despite all she’s been through  her spirits are high  her eyes shine and she continues to amaze and inspire the doctors and other health care providers with her recovery and attitude. She remains a light in the room.Her family has surrounded her with loving care. Her room is decorated with pictures  inspirational verses and well wishes from family and friends.  Tens of thousands  literally around the world have been praying for Danny. Her courage in the face of enormous trials and complications have touched so many hearts. So many have asked what they can do and how they can help.  For those that would like to make any kind of financial contributions towards the enormous medical and long term rehabilitation expenses  this GoFundMe page provides that opportunity.  The Mumm family would like to thanks everyone for their thoughts  prayers and any kind of help you would like to provide. While the Mumm family has health insurance  the costs are enormous – and the intensive life-saving care and rehabilitation comes with a big price tag.Please share this with everyone you know. Together  we can move mountains for Danny!“Truly I tell you  if anyone says to a mountain  ‘Go throw yourself into the sea ’ and does not doubt in their heart  but believes… it will be done for them.”                                                      -  Jesus Christ  Mark 11:23"

That night  their 13-year-old son  Sean Luca started complaining of a headache  and began acting in a very agitated and confused manner. He was hyperactive  and fixated on tiny details for extended periods of time. Having no idea what was going on  over the next few days  he met with neurologists  psychiatrists  and psychologists  and had a CT scan of the brain  an MRI  MRA  multiple EEGs  and lots and lots of blood work.On December 15th  Sean Luca had to be admitted to the hospital because his headaches were still so severe  and he spent 5 nights as an inpatient until his headache finally broke. He was released from hospital on medication and was generally ok for almost two weeks. Then the headaches came back.  This pattern of multi-day headaches followed by periods of breakthrough continued for a few months. At the time  he was given a diagnosis of atypical confusional migraines onset by puberty. He missed several months of school.  But Dave and Domenica knew something still wasn’t right.  He exhibited an array of symptoms which varied from day-to-day  and sometimes from minute-to-minute. These included obsessive-compulsive behavior  verbal and physical tics  anxiety attacks  irritability  mood swings  reclusive behavior  temper tantrums  immature behavior  difficulty with attention and concentration  hyperactivity  oppositional behavior  and becoming suddenly overwhelmed with different situations  completely out of the blue. Over time  his headaches began to wane in frequency  but these other symptoms were becoming more common.  The treatments he was getting didn’t seem to be working.At the beginning of June  2018--seven months after his symptoms began and after countless tests and doctor’s visits--he finally got a diagnosis: Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (“PANS”). This is still a relatively new diagnosis  and there are few experts in the country. If you would like to learn more about PANS  please watch “Brain on Fire” on Netflix.  A team in St. Petersburg  FL started to treat Sean Luca with an extended course of antibiotics and they saw some initial improvement. As a part of the treatment  he was admitted to Miami Children’s Hospital for a two-day treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”). After that treatment Sean Luca reported that he was finally feeling well.  He felt so well that he was able to go back to school in August and had an amazing first week.  He handled the back-to-school rigors with ease and resumed the activities he once loved.  Dave and Domenica thought the nightmare they had been living was over. But  just 10 short days after his symptoms disappeared  they were back.  And they haven’t gone away since.   In late August  Sean was seen by the preeminent expert on PANS  who is located in New York.   Writing about Sean Luca  that doctor recently wrote  “symptoms continue to progress and are severely affecting his life quality. This bright young boy is being affected by a condition that can be treated. In fact  without proper treatment  symptoms will continue to progress and eventually become permanent and irreversible.” The specialist ultimately recommended ongoing IVIG treatment for at least three months.  Sean Luca is currently in the process of receiving that treatment.Now that Sean Luca is doing a little better  he is more aware of his situation. And  that awareness is frankly a setback.  He is stressed about missing school.  You see  he hasn’t actually been to school since August 20th  and was recently enrolled in the Hospital Homebound program so that he can catch up on school work once he feels better.  He may or may not be able to complete eighth grade.  Every calendar update on his phone when he misses a voice lesson  an audition  or even “test prep” upsets him by reminding him what he’s missing. He cries himself to sleep most nights asking  “why me?” or “when will this go away?”  Those questions are painful for a parent to hear and gut wrenching to try to answer when you don’t have an answer.  When people ask how he’s doing  it is difficult for Dave and Domenica to answer. On the one hand  he’s doing so much better. Unfortunately  he doesn’t feel better. He still exhibits most of his PANS symptoms  and still struggles with elements of everyday functioning.  There are brief periods where Dave and Domenica see glimpses of the old Sean Luca:  a kind  funny  and empathetic kid who loves to sing and to serve his community.  Unfortunately  those times are short lived.   Doctors can’t really say when he might expect to see a return to his old self.  Their stock answer has been that “every patient is different.” They are encouraged at the forward momentum that he has experienced even though it is slow.  Sean Luca’s medical bills have amounted to more than $750 000 since this nightmare began.  And  despite the fact that IVIG is the only treatment that has worked for him  the family’s health insurance company refused to approve the treatment for him.Dave and Domenica  along with his doctors  filed a grievance against the insurance company. After a very protracted fight  the State of California  where the insurance company is based  eventually ruled in their favor.  Even taking into account the favorable ruling regarding the insurance  they will be out-of-pocket by more than $150 000 since Sean Luca’s symptoms began last year.Many of you know Dave and Domenica.  If you do  you know that they are some of the most kind  generous people there are.  What they have gone through in the past year is something that no one should have to endure.  This has been devastating to them both financially and emotionally.  Their strength has been extraordinary  but they could really use some help to overcome the financial and mental burden this has caused.  So  I ask you:  Please  if you can spare a few dollars during this season of giving  please do so.  No amount is too small but anything you can contribute would be so meaningful to Dave and Domenica.  Let’s make a difference in this beautiful family’s life."

Although  Greg had proposed to Jacque in Ireland a few months earlier and an Autumn 2018 wedding was planned  they moved up the date to January 2018 so that Greg could be covered under Jacque's insurance. This also allowed Jacque's Dad  who was very ill  to attend his daughter's wedding.Jacque  in addition to supporting Greg  spent a lot of time trying to help her Mom and Dad during his final months in Spring 2018. Her Dad died April 2018  leaving a huge hole  and the grieving has been very heavy.Greg's treatment started at UCSF almost immediately in Jan 2018 but the cancer is very aggressive and  despite immunotherapy  the melanoma spread to his spine  lungs  and brain and is now Stage IV Melanoma. He happens to be one of the 50% of melanoma patients with a melanoma BRAF mutation and so  because immunotherapy was not working and the side effects were very difficult to handle  he was switched to BRAF-targeting medications. Greg had to stop working due to the side effects of the medications and spread of the cancer and Jacque and Greg could no longer afford rent on their apartment. They moved in with Jacque's mom  Renate  and continue to live with her now. Renate works as a Nurse Practitioner.Since diagnosis  Greg has had two Gamma Knife procedures on his brain which have helped to shrink and/or disappear most of the 26 brain cancer lesions  which is wonderful. He and Jacque love their radiation oncologist at UCSF  Dr. Raleigh. Greg  also had radiation on his spine and the cancer is now gone from this region as far as we know. The BRAF medications may be shrinking some of the cancers in other parts of his body  too  including areas on his chest wall  gallbladder  and bladder. We are hopeful that his treatment will ultimately be successful.Unfortunately  we just received word a few minutes ago that Greg has leptomeningeal disease  which is a rare spread of the cancer to his cerebrospinal fluid  the fluid covering his brain and his spinal cord.  This is causing severe nausea  vomiting and headache and he was treated in the ER yesterday for these symptoms. The radiation oncologist just recommended whole brain radiation which may happen as early as next week and carries some significant permanent cognitive side effects. Jacque is going to try to get Greg into a leptomeningeal specialist at MDAnderson in Texas. With this new news  Jacque is informing her employer this AM that she will be taking Family Medical Leave.Although insurance and prior authorizations and a million phone calls are a pain  health insurance has so far covered the majority of Greg's health care costs. It is not clear if this will be the case for MDAnderson.Will you please reach out to Jacque and Greg? Jacque  especially  would love to hear your voice  or better  a text message or FB message  and receive a virtual hug. Will you please pray for them? They are suffering greatly. Will you please support them financially if you can? The flights and AirBnB costs in SanDiego when they fly down to UCSD for doctor's appointments  especially  are very expensive. We are also hoping for a very special trip to Ireland in June so that Greg can spend time with his family there  if he is able to tolerate the travel.Thank you  in advance  for considering support and thank you especially for your prayers."

She's a doting mother and adoring grandmother. I know because she's my sister's mother-in-law and nana to my niece  Lily  and nephew  Ben  and her newest granddaughter  Hannah. She makes those around her feel better about themselves. A former nurse  caring for others is in her blood.  She toasts her late husband of 44 years  John  with a glass of Malbec at dinner. Her laugh lights up a room.  She's cool. Her friends and family call her Patti.But her life took a tragic turn in an instant on Nov. 28 while she was on her daily morning walk with her dog  Dash. Patti slipped on a patch of ice while crossing the road and fell backward  fracturing her T4 vertebra in the middle of her spinal column. She didn’t know it yet  but she had lost the use of her legs forever.Mercifully  a passerby came to her aid. Patti was taken to a local hospital near her home in Coldwater  Ontario  and later that day was airlifted to Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto  where she underwent emergency surgery. Doctors implanted a steel rod to stabilize her spinal column  but they couldn’t repair the nerves that were severed when her vertebra shattered.Spinal cord injuries are classified A to E  with A being the most severe. Patti's injury has been classified a B. She has no motor function and limited sensory function below the mid-chest. Doctors have since informed her that she is paraplegic.True to form  Patti is in good spirits. But a long road to recovery and rehabilitation lies ahead  as do myriad expenses to ensure she can move on with her life  spreading joy and love and her cool vibe to her friends and family.  Doctors plan by mid-month to relocate Patti to the Lyndhurst Centre at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute  where she will spend anywhere from six weeks to six months adjusting to her new reality. Insurance  through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan  will cover her medical expenses  but not all of the costs after her physical rehabilitation – the wheelchair she'll need  renovations to her home  retrofitting her vehicle  in-home assistance or long-term care. The Dana and Christopher Reeve Foundation estimate the first-year cost of paraplegia to be $518 000   with yearly expenses of roughly $69 000 thereafter. Please pray for Patti and consider pulling together for a woman who has meant so much to so many.THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SET UP TO ENSURE THAT PATTI HAS EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO ALL FUNDS RAISED."

As parents  we would all fight to do anything within our power to protect our children!  When we have been able to try natural alternatives  Alexa has responded well  but none of those things that would help her ( vitamin IV therapy  homeopathic treatments  acupuncture  nutritionist to name a few) are covered by insurance.  We have to pay out of pocket for these alternatives and it is very expensive  so we cannot do all that we would like to do.   There is a naturopathic doctor in our local area who has been doing some innovative treatments and we know this would benefit our daughter  but the first visit with detailed lab work is $1500.   Alexa deserves to lead the life of a 24 year old- having fun  going out with friends  having a steady job that she enjoys  the things many of us take for granted.  These alternative treatments can help her to achieve that and not being able to provide all of that is heartbreaking.We need to remove this financial stress from Alexa and our family  so we are asking for help.   Our hope is that we can  cover our current and some of our upcoming medical costs and also to give Alexa the chance to receive the other types of natural therapies she needs so there won't be a need for such frequent hospital stays.  Even with the help of her doctor  Alexa  is fighting both lung and digestive symptoms right now and I feel like we are just frozen without sufficient resources to explore other alternative treatments. We desperately want to do all we can to support her health and raising this money would provide enormous relief and hopefully a better future for my sweet girl."

In February 2019  Tamra was diagnosed with a very rare form of stage 3 cancer—called angiosarcoma of the heart. Stage 3. Rare. Angiosarcoma of the heart.Those words have pierced every single one of us. If you’re reading this  we have all had the same thoughts running through our heads:But  Tamra has an entire life ahead of her…But  Tamra is the mother to two young children who need her…But  they’re an Air Force family stationed on the other side of the world… What would you do?Up until February  the Grelck Family had been living an exciting overseas adventure thanks to the United States Air Force  where Matt is a Senior Master Sergeant currently serving as the Deputy Fire Chief at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. Tamra is a dedicated military wife and stay-at-home mother to Oliver (5) and Emerson (2). But behind the scenes  Tamra hasn’t felt good for months.  In the fall  Tamra was diagnosed with pericarditis. She has been in and out of many European hospitals  but no matter how many times the doctors drained the fluid around her heart  it returned time and time again.  An MRI taken in February indicated there was a mass on Tamra’s heart. Something was very wrong—and Tamra was in a hospital on the other side of the world.Tamra and Matt made one of the biggest decisions of their lives. After receiving approval from her doctors—and with little notice—they bought last minute airplane tickets  packed a few bags for the family  and boarded a plane holding Oliver and Emerson in their arms  destined for Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto  California. 5 649 miles away.A new chance at life—and a new life. Now in California  Tamra was rushed from the plane directly to some of the most renowned doctors in the world at Stanford University. But  the news was dire: she was diagnosed with a very rare form of stage 3 cancer called angiosarcoma  of the heart. Tamra’s medical team performed emergency heart surgery. They found the two masses that had been identified on a PET scan  but also 10 additional tumors when they opened her heart. During the surgery  surgeons physically disconnected her heart from her body to operate  keeping her alive on an artificial heart and lung machine. Her doctors had to reconstruct part of her heart. Dr. Joseph Woo and his team have literally given Tamra a chance to survive with this surgery. Of the 4 000 known cases ever of this form of cancer… well  the Google results aren’t easy to look at. But Dr. Woo’s techniques have removed all visible signs of this incredibly aggressive form of cancer and the next step in this process is tough.There is no break for Tamra to recover from open heart  heart out of body  break your ribs to access your heart surgery—she is on a race against time. The doctors have ordered 5 rounds of two types of chemotherapy over the next several months. Chemotherapy where each round consists of five  10-hour days in a row of treatment that leaves the body weak and unable to care for young children. They are cautiously hopeful that with this aggressive treatment  Tamra can beat the odds.But  while Tamra fights the battle of her life…life also goes on. Except now  in California. Expensive  Silicon Valley  California. The Grelck Family will remain near Stanford for months while Tamra undergoes an extremely aggressive chemotherapy regimen. While they are incredibly fortunate to be under the best medical care possible  they are still living away from their home and are still obligated to pay rent for their home with all utilities  a still parked-at-the-airport car  and belongings in Germany—with significant living expenses accruing in Palo Alto. Matt and Tamra are depleting their savings and retirement at a rapid clip  even with a very generous health insurance plan.Help Tamra kick this rare cancer!If you know Tamra  you know she is determined to fight this cancer. After all  she has an entire life ahead of her! She has two young children who need a mother! And she has an Air Force adventure in Germany awaiting her return!If you’re worried about Tamra and want to help in some meaningful way  consider making a gift to help support the Grelck family’s living expenses in the Bay Area. Tamra needs to focus on regaining her strength. Instead  she is focusing on:·        A monthly rent that  although the cheapest they could find  is still very expensive for a modest house near Stanford Hospital·        Groceries and healthy meal prep delivery for herself and the kids  both now and when Matt has to return to service in Germany later this spring·        Transportation around the Bay Area for the family·        Childcare in the Bay AreaThe Grelcks are a single-income military family. Any relief of out-of-pocket expenses will help Tamra focus solely on the fight of her life and meaningful time with her family. Thank you in advance for your love and care."

With the help of friends and family we have decided to reach out for your support and donations to help my mom remain strong  positive  and courageous as she takes on the coming challenges of fighting pancreatic cancer. The last two weeks have been life changing and we want people to know our story.Two weeks ago today  my mom woke up with jaundice  her skin and the whites of her eyes were turning yellow and so of course we went straight to the hospital. This came after weeks of not feeling well but up until this point it was easy to blame stomach aches on changes in diet and back pain on sleeping funny. A few days prior  my mom did see her regular physician to have some blood work and an ultrasound done  but we had not received the results of those tests yet. We had discussed possibilities based on our own research and what other people had been telling us  maybe gallstones? Or H Pylori? In the emergency room we never expected to be told that she had pancreatic cancer. The hospital admitted my mom and told us that she would need a biopsy done and a biliary stent put in to allow the bile to pass through normally again. The tumor had begun pushing into the surrounding area and created a bile blockage and this is why she was turning yellow with jaundice. We learned that this is usually how people find out they have pancreatic cancer  no other early detections or symptoms occur in most cases. My mom spent that Friday and the rest of the weekend at Torrance Memorial and finally on Tuesday morning she had her procedure done.  Everything went as planned for that procedure and she was able to come home with me and my brother later that night. She has been recovering from the procedure with some pain but she is a fighter  if you know my mom  you know she is tough when she needs to be! Heres the part that makes this extremely difficult to even talk about. My mom currently does not have insurance. You all know health insurance is a big problem for many of us right now. Even with better access to healthcare and for some  more affordable plans  the fact is that many of us struggle to pay for healthcare. For some of us  the changes to healthcare in recent years has made the prices of our healthcare go up just enough to make it unaffordable. My mom is someone who experienced this cost increase. My mom does now have insurance on the way and it will be effective in December.  The Oncologist told us my mom needs to get started with chemo treatments  as soon as possible. At this point the tumor is inoperable and needs to shrink before there is any chance of removing it. This is because the tumor is surrounding two arteries and trying to remove it now would not be successful. We are asking for your help. We need to raise money to help us pay for medical bills and so that my mom can start getting chemo treatments as soon as possible. My mom will not be working or getting her normal income during this time. Donations will also help bills and other expenses so that my mom can get through this difficult time without any added stress. Together  with friends  family  church  we can meet our goal! My mom has loved working at First Lutheran Church and School in Torrance for over 20 years providing morning  after school and summer daycare programs (known as FLASH or First Lutheran After School Hours) for grades kindergarten to 8th grade. She started working at FLS when I was in 6th grade and my brother was in 8th grade.  She has seen generations of kids grow up from kindergarten to graduating from 8th grade. She has lent her creativity and organizational skills to insuring the kids have a fun and safe place to go before and after school and all throughout the summer. She spreads the message of PEACE & LOVE to everyone and continues to be my strength as we take each day one at a time. Im reaching out to all our friends  family  neighbors  FLS families  alumni  faculty  and anyone else that my mom has inspired to live with PEACE & LOVE. Please bookmark this page and check back for our updates about my mom  Shelly Karasony.

"Medical","April 9, 2019","Gemma and Cody Toxic Mold Recovery Fund","$27,346","$75,000","141","7","141","145","LOSANGELES","CA","LOSING EVERYTHINGBack in July 2017  we moved to a new apartment and both started to become rapidly and increasingly ill. A mold testing company confirmed the presence of toxic mold in the apartment  and several lab tests from our doctor confirmed it was making us extremely sick.  One of the major blood test lab values that shows inflammation from mold exposure has a healthy normal range that should be under 2 000; Cody’s was nearly 20 000 and Gemma’s was nearly 10 000. In December of 2017  as a result of mold exposure  we were both diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) which is a complex illness considered to be an acquired brain injury. CIRS creates profound immune system dysregulation and damages multiple organ systems. Our doctor told us we needed to move immediately and get rid of almost everything we own. Because air-borne mold toxins attach to anything porous (clothes  electronics  books  photos  furniture  linens etc.)  if we brought all of our belongings with us  they would continue to expose our body to mold and make us sick. Our apartment building was not cooperative and we had to get a lawyer to help us get out of our lease. So at the beginning of 2018  we took our beloved cat  a few belongings that we could clean the mold from  and moved-- beginning our long and complicated recovery process. For a few months  it felt like we were camping in limbo with no furniture and none of our familiar things around us. Sleeping on the floor was really a grand adventure!Unfortunately for us  while toxic mold exposure is widely recognized as a health hazard  the associated illness is not recognized by health insurance and so almost all of our medical expenses have been out of pocket. Additionally  our renter’s insurance was unable to cover any of our losses due to lack of cooperation and acknowledgment of a problem by our landlord. We researched legal recourse about getting sick from mold and found that the options were extremely discouraging and unlikely to end in our favor. Before we became sick we were fortunate to be debt-free and now we have over $50k of medically related debt. Cody has been unable to work since the end of July 2017 and has had to repeatedly turn down work that he wants to do  because he is still too ill. Gemma has only been able to work around two days a week in her own practice for most of this time and still needs a lot of time to rest and recover.THE WORST OF IT..Cody lost 30+ lbs and went from working out five times a week to barely being able to walk for five minutes. He became bedridden the majority of the time with debilitating fatigue  numbness throughout his arms and legs  very low blood pressure  constant dizziness and sudden joint pain. For a long time he was unable to drive and has been unable to work at all since the end of 7/2017. Before getting sick he had a successful and rewarding career in software engineering/product management that he is hoping to be able to resume soon. Gemma started experiencing severe respiratory problems  severe food allergies causing her throat to close up  (even having to give up her beloved teas at a certain point)  debilitating nausea  edema  dizziness  extreme fatigue  painful rashes and muscle/joint pain. She also developed a painful tumor in her abdomen that luckily turned out to be benign. Before getting sick she was growing her psychotherapy practice while completing kids yoga teacher training. She has had to significantly scale back on her hours and put plans for further therapy training and certifications on hold. We both also developed systemic electrolyte imbalances  circulation issues  migraines  thyroid problems  staph infections in our sinuses  other co-infections throughout our bodies (because the mold mycotoxins weaken the body) and developed sensitivity to chemicals and artificial fragrance. In short  our immune systems became completely overloaded and sensitive to things that wouldn’t affect people with a healthy immune system. Because mold is a known neurotoxin  we both started to notice brain impairments stemming from neuro-inflammation  starting with severe brain fog and developing into issues with short-term memory and word recall. WHY US?Through many lab tests and working with a functional medicine doctor  Cody and I learned that we both have a specific genetic type in the HLA gene complex  that makes us susceptible to mold-related illnesses and other autoimmune illnesses. In people who don’t have this genetic profile  in being exposed to toxic mold your body would recognize the mold as an invader  mount an appropriate immune response and clear the toxins out of your body. You likely would not develop any symptoms or problems. Unfortunately  our bodies are not able to see and identify mold properly  so the immune system can’t respond appropriately and the mold never gets cleared out of the body. The toxic byproducts of mold continue to accumulate in the body  causing rampant inflammation and organ damage. In people like us who have become sick from toxic mold  the rates of autoimmune diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are significantly higher  so we are trying to be as proactive as possible in healing the damage that has been done and doing it quickly.WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR HELPThis illness has been a huge setback for us in terms of getting married and starting a family  which is ultimately our driving goal. Gemma has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember and is hoping that despite this illness  she will still be able to. The good news is that we have been in the recovery process from this illness for the last year and are slowly  but surely getting better. While it has been incredibly challenging and unbelievably scary at times  it has made our relationship stronger and better than ever. We have been true partners in this and will be forever grateful to have had each other throughout this process. Chronic illness has been a true test and has offered us a very new and different perspective on what is really important and meaningful in life. The bad news is that getting our health back has been much slower  complicated and more difficult than we imagined. We have exhausted many of the treatment protocols for CIRS and some of our lab markers are sadly still too high to progress to the next stages of treatment. Ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have a lot of success in reducing toxic burden  regulating immune functioning and lowering inflammation  so we are hoping that they will be a pivotal next step for us. We have tried both treatments and so far have found them helpful and encouraging. But the full courses of both treatments are lengthy and costly and we need some help in finishing this part of our treatment. After almost two years of being very ill  we feel that they are the best chance we have at getting our health and our lives back. We are looking to these recommended treatments to hopefully begin to truly get better and resume living a full life again. We would be so grateful for any help that you are able to offer. Thank you!WHAT YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO TOWARDS:$25k for needed diagnostics and treatmentsThese treatments are supposed to be incredibly effective and healing  but not covered by insurance as they are considered “off-label”.• MRI with neuroquant analysis to assess for brain damage and guide next steps in rehabilitation. • Ozone hematography therapy: 15-20 ozone treatments; $450 per treatment   $13 500 -$18 000 for both of us.Ozone is a treatment that involves removing blood  adding ozone to it and then recirculating the ozonated blood back in the body. Ozone is both detoxifying and healing at the same time  helping to remove toxins and pathogens  while helping the immune system regulate itself.• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: 40 HBOT treatments; $100 per treatment  $8 000 for both of usHyperbaric is a treatment that involves breathing in pure oxygen in a pressurized environment that allows oxygen to saturate cells in the body in a more profound way. Like ozone therapy  it helps heal infections and inflammation and is particularly effective for brain injuries.$50k for current medical debt:We have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on prescribed medications  supplements  doctors  diagnostics  lab tests  treatments  mold testing etc.  We also had to completely refurnish our new apartment  buy new clothes  computers  electronics  etc.Thank you for taking the time to read our story and offer any help if you are moved to do so. Any amount will help and please feel free to share with others if you’d like."

"Medical","November 16, 2018","Miracle for Meg","$26,055","$100,000","388","5","382","415","SAVANNAH","GA","!!Please check our UPDATES (the tab right of 'Story') for important information!!Follow along on her journey:Meghan's Photography Work Meghan's Personal Instagram Our sweet friend Meghan is in immediate need of surgeries and medical treatment in order to aid multiple complications arising from a degenerative disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (known as EDS.) Though we are providing her with care and support  cooking meals for her  carrying her up and down stairs  laughing and crying with her  her condition has gotten to a point where we are unable to give her the serious medical care she requires.Though we would not shy away from the challenge if we knew how! That is the contagious spirit we've absorbed from our friendships with Meghan. You see  Meghan has an oversized heart (figuratively; the best kind!) and we know that she will not let her condition put limitations on the opportunities in her life. But she needs our help. Aside from her physical condition  pain has touched many areas of her life  and although it is not our place to share those things publicly  we can tell you that she is grateful for her life and uses that pain to learn about herself and help others.Somehow  she is beaming with innocence and courage.With your kindness  we are raising money for upcoming costs related to complicated  major surgeries  that will change her life. Just like she has changed ours. We'll give you more details below.This is Meghan's story:A few months ago Meghan was bounding in the waves along the coast (floating helps relieve weight from her muscles and bones ) taking her Australian dogs on a roadtrip in the North Carolina hills and creating beautiful photographs as a professional photographer. Now  she struggles to walk to the bathroom. Sometimes she will even get down and crawl on the floor. As her friends  it is heartbreaking to watch what seems like never-ending waves of taking over her life.So  What's The Deal?Without going into too much detail  Meghan is suffering from a diverse array of chronic pain and degenerative symptoms due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. EDS is a disorder that causes hypermobility in joints and affects the connective-tissue in those that have it. Connective-tissue is the skin that wraps around our organs  muscles  nerves  veins and so on. Recently  connective-tissue was classified as an organ  which gives us so much hope for the future of EDS research and quality of life for those with EDS (hang in there guys.)Due to EDS  Meghan's joints bend in ways that ours do not  and it can be very dangerous. Large  dark bruises appear on her body overnight. We're pretty sure she's not a street fighter!Among the many symptoms that come with EDS  she experiences constant pain from the moment of waking up  all the way until the end of the night. Sometimes the days don't end for Meghan  and she cannot fall asleep for multiple days because of excruciating pain. But  what kind of pain?EDS is her overall condition  but it is common to have a bundle of disorders with EDS.Meghan also has Tethered-Cord (TC) which is when the spinal cord fails to detach from the bone structure of the spine. This likely happened in the womb  and causes many mobility issues and nerve issues  such as complete numbness in the legs (Meghan often can't feel her legs even when walking or driving ) intense and uncontrollable muscle spasms that happen at any moment and a variety of shooting pains throughout the nerves in her lower body. Just to name a few. There is also not much dura around her brain  which is basically jelly that cushions the brain against vibrations. Most people don't have to worry about it  but when driving Meghan we try to take side roads that have the least amount of potholes and cracks  because her brain jams into her spine on a slight bump and causes immobilizing pain. Just imagine your brain in a vice. Then there is the craniocervical instability. It means the vertebrae in her neck that support her head are highly unstable  and they actually pinch her brain stem. She cannot turn her head much at all  and she especially cannot tilt her head back like when you want to feel the rain on your face  or look at the clouds.And also POTS. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome if you want the full name. In simple terms  it is a syndrome which interferes with the rate of bloodflow as well as the heart rate. Sounds pretty straight forward  but it causes Meghan's body to have difficulty regulating her temperature  feeling extreme heat and cold in a place that is room temperature. It also causes gastrointestinal complications  foggy brain  fatigue  anxiety  headaches and migraines  intense chest pain and insomnia  to name a few. Her body is attacking itself in what seems like an endless cycle of pain. It is fighting itself and shutting down.Here's What's NextMeghan has been pushed off of her health insurance and is not eligible for disability. Currently  her family and friends are providing basic care and needs around the clock  but she urgently needs surgery. Like  yesterday.Earlier this week (mid-December) her primary EDS specialist in Baltimore  Dr. Clair Francomano  decided that the most important need for Meghan is to undergo a surgery for Tethered-Cord and detach her spinal cord from her spine. This surgery will be performed by Dr. Petra Klinge also in Baltimore  but we need to get Meghan there as soon as possible for a consultation.We are unsure how we will accomplish this financially  but nothing is impossible and we love our friend to the end of the earth. Following the surgery for Tethered-Cord  Meghan will rest and recover before having a Spinal Fusion surgery peformed by Dr. Frasier Henderson in Baltimore. This surgery will fuse her C1 and C2 vertebrae  stabilizing her neck and relieving pressure from her brain. It is a common experience by those who have undergone this surgery that their normal pain level goes from an 8-9/10 down to a 2-4/10. One day while we were watching her dogs Waverly and Dakota run in the park  Meghan told me that she dreamt of being able to run in and out of the trees with her dogs for just one minute. With this surgery  that would be a real possibility.What Meghan Needs From YouIf you are reading this  donate $1. There will be friends  family and strangers who will donate much more  but most people will not be able to. If a thousand people see this and donate $1  that $1 000 will cover roundtrip travel to her first surgery  two consultations or just a lot of milkshakes from Five Guys  which Meghan loves.It is not easy to understand what Meghan is going through by reading scientific reviews of her symptoms  or even reading this GoFundMe campaign. But when you see it with your eyes  it is right there; she is a wonderful person  and she is in so much pain. Let's succeed in raising the funds Meghan needs to enjoy some of the most basic things  like looking at the clouds. All donations made to this GoFundMe campain will go towards:- Major surgery for Tethered-Cord with Dr. Petra Klinge- Major surgery for Spinal Fusion with Dr. Frasier Henderson- Flights  hotels  Air BnBs  Ubers and expenses related to travel for surgeries- Service dog training through Compass Key Organization for Waverly  her energetic and loyal Australian Blue Heeler- CT scans needed - Living expenses during recovery- Health insurance premiums- In-home caregiver when needed- Mobility aids - Medical bills associated with consultations  surgery  bracing  orthotics  hospital fees etc."

This was a complete shock. Not only is he a non smoker and an avid free diver and fisherman but otherwise a very healthy person who showed no symptoms that something was wrong. This particular cancer although most common in Non-Smokers  is still very rare to find in someone of Manny's age range.Despite this heavy diagnosis Manny is considerably one of the luckiest people I know. . You can say that someone or something has always had their eye on him  helping him get out of situations you would only see in movies... The \"Force\" is strong in him. Thus far  this situation has been no different. He was able to obtain health insurance right before the cancer diagnosis  he tested positive for a Gene mutation that is very responsive to a particular treatment he is currently on  but most importantly and above all he is surrounded by people who love him that will do anything they can to help ease any additional stress possible during this difficult time. At this point Manny's only job is to heal. This is the reason for this go fund me. The money donated will help pay off his current medical debt which is north of $10 000 as well as help sustain his monthly expenses during his treatment. Although his insurance company very reluctantly approved of the $14 000 per month medication Manny is currently taking  it is possible that they can deny coverage in the future. The thought of that kind of financial stress is daunting. He is currently on his 10th day of treatment and besides following his doctors orders  he has also started following a restricted diet  maintaining his daily presence at the gym and going fishing as often as possible to maintain low stress levels. The funds collected throughout this campaign will ensure that his focus can remain on healing and not on the strain that finances can cause. Manny has been so incredibly strong during this and has been great at maintaining his friends and family as optimistic and positive as he has been. Assuring us that this will just be another crazy life story to add under his belt.Thank you all in advance for your donations  support  & prayers."

By the time Kelsey was in 5th grade  the cancer had progressed to stage 4  and metastasized to other parts of her body with the prognosis that she had only 2 years to live. However  due to Laurie’s incredibly active and healthy lifestyle as a marathon runner and avid nutrition enthusiast  she persevered for 6 years instead of 2! Sadly  when Kelsey was 16 years old  her mother died from metastatic breast cancer after a long  12 year battle. Kelsey’s mother fought the cancer with valiant determination and will. Growing up  Kelsey participated in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure every year  and ran by her mother’s side. Kelsey attended countless chemotherapy and radiation treatments  surgeries  etc. with her mother. Fighting cancer became a daily event  and a regular part of life for Kelsey and her family. Kelsey’s mom was always clear - be determined  be confident  and do everything you can to stay healthy.  She coaches at FitHaus (OurHaus CrossFit) and embodies the example of health and wellness we hope to share with everyone that walks through the doors.Kelsey (and her two younger brothers) have been tracked since a very young age due to the genetic component that is so commonly associated when breast cancer is diagnosed and terminal at such a young age in the mother. After several rounds of testing over the years and many recommendations from both Kelsey and Laurie’s previous primary and oncology doctors  Kelsey needs to undergo a double mastectomy as she is in the top 20% of high risk for breast cancer. Even though she does not test positive for the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes  there are many other genes associated with breast cancer  and with all variables included  doctors are highly suspect there is a genetic component at hand and are recommending surgery as a preventative measure as soon as she can since Kelsey is within 5 years of the age her mother was diagnosed. Kelsey’s mother and great grandmother both died of aggressive forms of breast cancer at young ages and due to the pathology of the type of cancer Laurie had  doctors and Kelsey and her family do not want to take any risks. Your help would be SO appreciated:Unfortunately health insurance only covers double mastectomy surgeries if the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes test positive. Since this is not the case for her  Kelsey and Heidi will have to take on the costs out of pocket despite the medical necessity of completing this surgery. With this in mind  our FitHaus family would like to support their family in any way we can  one being financially.  That is why we have set up this Go Fund Me page ... to help Kelsey and her family pay for the medical costs for her surgery and give back a little to all that Kelsey offers us on a daily basis.Kelsey is scheduled to have surgery March 20  2019 and will be off from coaching at FitHaus for about a week before returning.  There will be other ways to help out Kelsey and her family  but if you're able to contribute financially  that would be so appreciated by all."

Her symptoms began to get worse within hours  which required fluids to alleviate her elevated heart rate and IV antibiotics at the infusion center. The second day at the infusion center  she was transferred by ambulance to IHC. Eventually she was transferred to the ICU at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City where she was finally diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.Not many people (and doctors) are aware of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) which delayed the initial diagnosis and made her case very serious  very fast.  SJS is a potentially deadly autoimmune disease that usually results from a drug reaction.  It can be caused by taking something as simple as ibuprofen.  In Allison's case  it's currently being investigated what caused the reaction. At the time of her transfer  she was receiving 3 different IV antibiotics. Another form of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Both forms of the disease can be deadly  extremely painful and distressing.  TEN manifests itself by causing the skin tissue over more than 30 percent of your body  as well as inside your mouth and throat  to begin to blister  die and detach.  This was the case with Allison  her skin rashes (or lesions) blistered and peeled and severely affected her ability to swallow and breath as the lesions attacked her mouth and went down her throat which was not only very painful but life threatening as well. It is comparable to having 3rd degree burns all over your body and inside your mouth and throat  which is why many people afflicted with SJS are often treated in Burn Units. SJS/TEN caused the top layer of Allison's skin and her mucous membranes  such as those covering her lips and eyes to peel off in waves.  Treatment was assessed at the University of Utah hospital and Allison remained in ICU for several days as her symptoms worsened.  Treatment included standard therapies used for major burns and the most severe were the lesions on her eyes.  Allison was given 20 minutes warning that they were going to perform emergency surgery to save her eyesight. It would require her to be blind for nearly two weeks  and even then there was no way to predict the outcome of the surgery.  Her eyes were sewn completely shut for nearly two weeks  she could not see anything but darkness. Allison had to be treated with high doses of steroids which were known to cause delirium and psychosis. She required 24/7 care which often was her devoted husband  Kevin  friends Misty and Jen.  Allison’s pain management was not under control  and continuously made her ill. She would wake up in the middle of the night in the midst of delusions unable to see and she did not know where she was or what was happening to her.  Symptoms persisted and worsened for up to two weeks before the skin and mucous membranes began to start to regress. Even though the lesions have begun to heal  it takes months to recover from SJS.  The surgery she had on her eyes was a success  however  she does have some residual issues seeing clearly which we hope will improve with time. Allison will be required to be followed for several years  and may require additional surgeries.  One of the most unfortunate consequences from this traumatic experience is the fact that Allison has now been diagnosed with PTSD due to the weeks of blindness  uncontrollable pain  and psychosis brought on by the IV steroids. The purpose of this Go Fund Me page is two-fold.  One  to increase the awareness of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and how it can affect anyone at any time  and two  to help the family with the enormous hospital and doctor bills they have incurred.  While Allison did have health insurance  most of the hospital expenses were considered \"out of network\" with substantial out of pocket costs. It is unclear at this time if the insurance will pay for any of the costs related to the \"experimental\" eye surgery.  We do not have a final amount of these costs yet - only an estimate  but any amount you can donate will be extremely appreciated by Allison and her family.Allison was separated from her 5 daughters for nearly one month and they are extremely happy to have her home.  She still requires nursing care and regular doctor visits and it will be many months before the peeling blisters all over her face and body will fade. There will also need to be ongoing evaluations to make sure her internal organs are not affected   Allison wishes to express her heartfelt appreciation to everyone who cared for her family in any way at all  from taking the girls overnight and to school and bringing in meals for the family.  The entire family is grateful in ways they simply cannot express in words.Sincerely Lisa West (aka: Grammie)"

To control this iron overload  Jessica has been on a chelation infusion 24/7 for the past year.  This chelation did not help reduce her iron overload.Her doctors are now concerned that she may be transitioning to aplastic anemia.Jessica is admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center where she is undergoing second round of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  As expected with chemotherapy  she is having a rough time with her symptoms and has developed heart failure and pneumonia.For the next many months  Jessica will be unable to work due to exposure to other individuals and having a weakened immune system.Her Mother is a  Special Education Teacher for the Deaf and Handicapped and is on family leave to take care of Jessica.  Her Father is a disabled war Veteran  who is unable to work. The family income has been greatly reduced.We are asking your help with Jessica and her family.  In addition to the limited family income  there are unpaid medical bills and it is also necessary to perform home modifications to ensure her safety over the next year while her new immune system develops.  In January 2019  she will not have health insurance due to her age.Thank you in advance for your assistance ... it is really appreciated.Peggy YorkovichUpdate: November 12  2018Jessica was taken for an TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) this morning.  They are concerned that she may have a heart valve defect that may need to be corrected.  A TEE allows a better/internal view of the heart's structure.  The doctors were unable to perform the procedure because she is in respiratory distress. Update: November 13  2018Finally some good news.  Sort of.  Jessica feels a little better today and the TEE was able to be performed.   The heart mitral valve defect was discovered.  One of the 2 valves was completely deformed and most of the work was done by the other part of the valve.The cardiologist feels that this can be controlled by medication for the time being.  Further evaluation and any treatment can be performed after she is discharged from the hospital.Update: November 15  2018Very unhappy little girl today.  She was expecting to come home today  but her blood counts are down  she has respiratory distress again  and nosebleeds. Another chest x-ray is going to be performed.Update: November 17  2018She's home!  Very happy to sleep in her own bed and see her puppy.   We definitely have a lot to be thankful this Thanksgiving.  Now the long road to recovery begins ...Thank you everyone for your help during these difficult times.  Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Medical","April 9, 2019","Gemma and Cody Toxic Mold Recovery Fund","$27,346","$75,000","141","7","141","145","LOSANGELES","CA","LOSING EVERYTHINGBack in July 2017  we moved to a new apartment and both started to become rapidly and increasingly ill. A mold testing company confirmed the presence of toxic mold in the apartment  and several lab tests from our doctor confirmed it was making us extremely sick.  One of the major blood test lab values that shows inflammation from mold exposure has a healthy normal range that should be under 2 000; Cody’s was nearly 20 000 and Gemma’s was nearly 10 000. In December of 2017  as a result of mold exposure  we were both diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) which is a complex illness considered to be an acquired brain injury. CIRS creates profound immune system dysregulation and damages multiple organ systems. Our doctor told us we needed to move immediately and get rid of almost everything we own. Because air-borne mold toxins attach to anything porous (clothes  electronics  books  photos  furniture  linens etc.)  if we brought all of our belongings with us  they would continue to expose our body to mold and make us sick. Our apartment building was not cooperative and we had to get a lawyer to help us get out of our lease. So at the beginning of 2018  we took our beloved cat  a few belongings that we could clean the mold from  and moved-- beginning our long and complicated recovery process. For a few months  it felt like we were camping in limbo with no furniture and none of our familiar things around us. Sleeping on the floor was really a grand adventure!Unfortunately for us  while toxic mold exposure is widely recognized as a health hazard  the associated illness is not recognized by health insurance and so almost all of our medical expenses have been out of pocket. Additionally  our renter’s insurance was unable to cover any of our losses due to lack of cooperation and acknowledgment of a problem by our landlord. We researched legal recourse about getting sick from mold and found that the options were extremely discouraging and unlikely to end in our favor. Before we became sick we were fortunate to be debt-free and now we have over $50k of medically related debt. Cody has been unable to work since the end of July 2017 and has had to repeatedly turn down work that he wants to do  because he is still too ill. Gemma has only been able to work around two days a week in her own practice for most of this time and still needs a lot of time to rest and recover.THE WORST OF IT..Cody lost 30+ lbs and went from working out five times a week to barely being able to walk for five minutes. He became bedridden the majority of the time with debilitating fatigue  numbness throughout his arms and legs  very low blood pressure  constant dizziness and sudden joint pain. For a long time he was unable to drive and has been unable to work at all since the end of 7/2017. Before getting sick he had a successful and rewarding career in software engineering/product management that he is hoping to be able to resume soon. Gemma started experiencing severe respiratory problems  severe food allergies causing her throat to close up  (even having to give up her beloved teas at a certain point)  debilitating nausea  edema  dizziness  extreme fatigue  painful rashes and muscle/joint pain. She also developed a painful tumor in her abdomen that luckily turned out to be benign. Before getting sick she was growing her psychotherapy practice while completing kids yoga teacher training. She has had to significantly scale back on her hours and put plans for further therapy training and certifications on hold. We both also developed systemic electrolyte imbalances  circulation issues  migraines  thyroid problems  staph infections in our sinuses  other co-infections throughout our bodies (because the mold mycotoxins weaken the body) and developed sensitivity to chemicals and artificial fragrance. In short  our immune systems became completely overloaded and sensitive to things that wouldn’t affect people with a healthy immune system. Because mold is a known neurotoxin  we both started to notice brain impairments stemming from neuro-inflammation  starting with severe brain fog and developing into issues with short-term memory and word recall. WHY US?Through many lab tests and working with a functional medicine doctor  Cody and I learned that we both have a specific genetic type in the HLA gene complex  that makes us susceptible to mold-related illnesses and other autoimmune illnesses. In people who don’t have this genetic profile  in being exposed to toxic mold your body would recognize the mold as an invader  mount an appropriate immune response and clear the toxins out of your body. You likely would not develop any symptoms or problems. Unfortunately  our bodies are not able to see and identify mold properly  so the immune system can’t respond appropriately and the mold never gets cleared out of the body. The toxic byproducts of mold continue to accumulate in the body  causing rampant inflammation and organ damage. In people like us who have become sick from toxic mold  the rates of autoimmune diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are significantly higher  so we are trying to be as proactive as possible in healing the damage that has been done and doing it quickly.WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR HELPThis illness has been a huge setback for us in terms of getting married and starting a family  which is ultimately our driving goal. Gemma has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember and is hoping that despite this illness  she will still be able to. The good news is that we have been in the recovery process from this illness for the last year and are slowly  but surely getting better. While it has been incredibly challenging and unbelievably scary at times  it has made our relationship stronger and better than ever. We have been true partners in this and will be forever grateful to have had each other throughout this process. Chronic illness has been a true test and has offered us a very new and different perspective on what is really important and meaningful in life. The bad news is that getting our health back has been much slower  complicated and more difficult than we imagined. We have exhausted many of the treatment protocols for CIRS and some of our lab markers are sadly still too high to progress to the next stages of treatment. Ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have a lot of success in reducing toxic burden  regulating immune functioning and lowering inflammation  so we are hoping that they will be a pivotal next step for us. We have tried both treatments and so far have found them helpful and encouraging. But the full courses of both treatments are lengthy and costly and we need some help in finishing this part of our treatment. After almost two years of being very ill  we feel that they are the best chance we have at getting our health and our lives back. We are looking to these recommended treatments to hopefully begin to truly get better and resume living a full life again. We would be so grateful for any help that you are able to offer. Thank you!WHAT YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO TOWARDS:$25k for needed diagnostics and treatmentsThese treatments are supposed to be incredibly effective and healing  but not covered by insurance as they are considered “off-label”.• MRI with neuroquant analysis to assess for brain damage and guide next steps in rehabilitation. • Ozone hematography therapy: 15-20 ozone treatments; $450 per treatment   $13 500 -$18 000 for both of us.Ozone is a treatment that involves removing blood  adding ozone to it and then recirculating the ozonated blood back in the body. Ozone is both detoxifying and healing at the same time  helping to remove toxins and pathogens  while helping the immune system regulate itself.• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: 40 HBOT treatments; $100 per treatment  $8 000 for both of usHyperbaric is a treatment that involves breathing in pure oxygen in a pressurized environment that allows oxygen to saturate cells in the body in a more profound way. Like ozone therapy  it helps heal infections and inflammation and is particularly effective for brain injuries.$50k for current medical debt:We have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on prescribed medications  supplements  doctors  diagnostics  lab tests  treatments  mold testing etc.  We also had to completely refurnish our new apartment  buy new clothes  computers  electronics  etc.Thank you for taking the time to read our story and offer any help if you are moved to do so. Any amount will help and please feel free to share with others if you’d like."

"Medical","November 16, 2018","Miracle for Meg","$26,055","$100,000","388","5","382","415","SAVANNAH","GA","!!Please check our UPDATES (the tab right of 'Story') for important information!!Follow along on her journey:Meghan's Photography Work Meghan's Personal Instagram Our sweet friend Meghan is in immediate need of surgeries and medical treatment in order to aid multiple complications arising from a degenerative disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (known as EDS.) Though we are providing her with care and support  cooking meals for her  carrying her up and down stairs  laughing and crying with her  her condition has gotten to a point where we are unable to give her the serious medical care she requires.Though we would not shy away from the challenge if we knew how! That is the contagious spirit we've absorbed from our friendships with Meghan. You see  Meghan has an oversized heart (figuratively; the best kind!) and we know that she will not let her condition put limitations on the opportunities in her life. But she needs our help. Aside from her physical condition  pain has touched many areas of her life  and although it is not our place to share those things publicly  we can tell you that she is grateful for her life and uses that pain to learn about herself and help others.Somehow  she is beaming with innocence and courage.With your kindness  we are raising money for upcoming costs related to complicated  major surgeries  that will change her life. Just like she has changed ours. We'll give you more details below.This is Meghan's story:A few months ago Meghan was bounding in the waves along the coast (floating helps relieve weight from her muscles and bones ) taking her Australian dogs on a roadtrip in the North Carolina hills and creating beautiful photographs as a professional photographer. Now  she struggles to walk to the bathroom. Sometimes she will even get down and crawl on the floor. As her friends  it is heartbreaking to watch what seems like never-ending waves of taking over her life.So  What's The Deal?Without going into too much detail  Meghan is suffering from a diverse array of chronic pain and degenerative symptoms due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. EDS is a disorder that causes hypermobility in joints and affects the connective-tissue in those that have it. Connective-tissue is the skin that wraps around our organs  muscles  nerves  veins and so on. Recently  connective-tissue was classified as an organ  which gives us so much hope for the future of EDS research and quality of life for those with EDS (hang in there guys.)Due to EDS  Meghan's joints bend in ways that ours do not  and it can be very dangerous. Large  dark bruises appear on her body overnight. We're pretty sure she's not a street fighter!Among the many symptoms that come with EDS  she experiences constant pain from the moment of waking up  all the way until the end of the night. Sometimes the days don't end for Meghan  and she cannot fall asleep for multiple days because of excruciating pain. But  what kind of pain?EDS is her overall condition  but it is common to have a bundle of disorders with EDS.Meghan also has Tethered-Cord (TC) which is when the spinal cord fails to detach from the bone structure of the spine. This likely happened in the womb  and causes many mobility issues and nerve issues  such as complete numbness in the legs (Meghan often can't feel her legs even when walking or driving ) intense and uncontrollable muscle spasms that happen at any moment and a variety of shooting pains throughout the nerves in her lower body. Just to name a few. There is also not much dura around her brain  which is basically jelly that cushions the brain against vibrations. Most people don't have to worry about it  but when driving Meghan we try to take side roads that have the least amount of potholes and cracks  because her brain jams into her spine on a slight bump and causes immobilizing pain. Just imagine your brain in a vice. Then there is the craniocervical instability. It means the vertebrae in her neck that support her head are highly unstable  and they actually pinch her brain stem. She cannot turn her head much at all  and she especially cannot tilt her head back like when you want to feel the rain on your face  or look at the clouds.And also POTS. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome if you want the full name. In simple terms  it is a syndrome which interferes with the rate of bloodflow as well as the heart rate. Sounds pretty straight forward  but it causes Meghan's body to have difficulty regulating her temperature  feeling extreme heat and cold in a place that is room temperature. It also causes gastrointestinal complications  foggy brain  fatigue  anxiety  headaches and migraines  intense chest pain and insomnia  to name a few. Her body is attacking itself in what seems like an endless cycle of pain. It is fighting itself and shutting down.Here's What's NextMeghan has been pushed off of her health insurance and is not eligible for disability. Currently  her family and friends are providing basic care and needs around the clock  but she urgently needs surgery. Like  yesterday.Earlier this week (mid-December) her primary EDS specialist in Baltimore  Dr. Clair Francomano  decided that the most important need for Meghan is to undergo a surgery for Tethered-Cord and detach her spinal cord from her spine. This surgery will be performed by Dr. Petra Klinge also in Baltimore  but we need to get Meghan there as soon as possible for a consultation.We are unsure how we will accomplish this financially  but nothing is impossible and we love our friend to the end of the earth. Following the surgery for Tethered-Cord  Meghan will rest and recover before having a Spinal Fusion surgery peformed by Dr. Frasier Henderson in Baltimore. This surgery will fuse her C1 and C2 vertebrae  stabilizing her neck and relieving pressure from her brain. It is a common experience by those who have undergone this surgery that their normal pain level goes from an 8-9/10 down to a 2-4/10. One day while we were watching her dogs Waverly and Dakota run in the park  Meghan told me that she dreamt of being able to run in and out of the trees with her dogs for just one minute. With this surgery  that would be a real possibility.What Meghan Needs From YouIf you are reading this  donate $1. There will be friends  family and strangers who will donate much more  but most people will not be able to. If a thousand people see this and donate $1  that $1 000 will cover roundtrip travel to her first surgery  two consultations or just a lot of milkshakes from Five Guys  which Meghan loves.It is not easy to understand what Meghan is going through by reading scientific reviews of her symptoms  or even reading this GoFundMe campaign. But when you see it with your eyes  it is right there; she is a wonderful person  and she is in so much pain. Let's succeed in raising the funds Meghan needs to enjoy some of the most basic things  like looking at the clouds. All donations made to this GoFundMe campain will go towards:- Major surgery for Tethered-Cord with Dr. Petra Klinge- Major surgery for Spinal Fusion with Dr. Frasier Henderson- Flights  hotels  Air BnBs  Ubers and expenses related to travel for surgeries- Service dog training through Compass Key Organization for Waverly  her energetic and loyal Australian Blue Heeler- CT scans needed - Living expenses during recovery- Health insurance premiums- In-home caregiver when needed- Mobility aids - Medical bills associated with consultations  surgery  bracing  orthotics  hospital fees etc."

This was a complete shock. Not only is he a non smoker and an avid free diver and fisherman but otherwise a very healthy person who showed no symptoms that something was wrong. This particular cancer although most common in Non-Smokers  is still very rare to find in someone of Manny's age range.Despite this heavy diagnosis Manny is considerably one of the luckiest people I know. . You can say that someone or something has always had their eye on him  helping him get out of situations you would only see in movies... The \"Force\" is strong in him. Thus far  this situation has been no different. He was able to obtain health insurance right before the cancer diagnosis  he tested positive for a Gene mutation that is very responsive to a particular treatment he is currently on  but most importantly and above all he is surrounded by people who love him that will do anything they can to help ease any additional stress possible during this difficult time. At this point Manny's only job is to heal. This is the reason for this go fund me. The money donated will help pay off his current medical debt which is north of $10 000 as well as help sustain his monthly expenses during his treatment. Although his insurance company very reluctantly approved of the $14 000 per month medication Manny is currently taking  it is possible that they can deny coverage in the future. The thought of that kind of financial stress is daunting. He is currently on his 10th day of treatment and besides following his doctors orders  he has also started following a restricted diet  maintaining his daily presence at the gym and going fishing as often as possible to maintain low stress levels. The funds collected throughout this campaign will ensure that his focus can remain on healing and not on the strain that finances can cause. Manny has been so incredibly strong during this and has been great at maintaining his friends and family as optimistic and positive as he has been. Assuring us that this will just be another crazy life story to add under his belt.Thank you all in advance for your donations  support  & prayers."

By the time Kelsey was in 5th grade  the cancer had progressed to stage 4  and metastasized to other parts of her body with the prognosis that she had only 2 years to live. However  due to Laurie’s incredibly active and healthy lifestyle as a marathon runner and avid nutrition enthusiast  she persevered for 6 years instead of 2! Sadly  when Kelsey was 16 years old  her mother died from metastatic breast cancer after a long  12 year battle. Kelsey’s mother fought the cancer with valiant determination and will. Growing up  Kelsey participated in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure every year  and ran by her mother’s side. Kelsey attended countless chemotherapy and radiation treatments  surgeries  etc. with her mother. Fighting cancer became a daily event  and a regular part of life for Kelsey and her family. Kelsey’s mom was always clear - be determined  be confident  and do everything you can to stay healthy.  She coaches at FitHaus (OurHaus CrossFit) and embodies the example of health and wellness we hope to share with everyone that walks through the doors.Kelsey (and her two younger brothers) have been tracked since a very young age due to the genetic component that is so commonly associated when breast cancer is diagnosed and terminal at such a young age in the mother. After several rounds of testing over the years and many recommendations from both Kelsey and Laurie’s previous primary and oncology doctors  Kelsey needs to undergo a double mastectomy as she is in the top 20% of high risk for breast cancer. Even though she does not test positive for the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes  there are many other genes associated with breast cancer  and with all variables included  doctors are highly suspect there is a genetic component at hand and are recommending surgery as a preventative measure as soon as she can since Kelsey is within 5 years of the age her mother was diagnosed. Kelsey’s mother and great grandmother both died of aggressive forms of breast cancer at young ages and due to the pathology of the type of cancer Laurie had  doctors and Kelsey and her family do not want to take any risks. Your help would be SO appreciated:Unfortunately health insurance only covers double mastectomy surgeries if the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes test positive. Since this is not the case for her  Kelsey and Heidi will have to take on the costs out of pocket despite the medical necessity of completing this surgery. With this in mind  our FitHaus family would like to support their family in any way we can  one being financially.  That is why we have set up this Go Fund Me page ... to help Kelsey and her family pay for the medical costs for her surgery and give back a little to all that Kelsey offers us on a daily basis.Kelsey is scheduled to have surgery March 20  2019 and will be off from coaching at FitHaus for about a week before returning.  There will be other ways to help out Kelsey and her family  but if you're able to contribute financially  that would be so appreciated by all."

Hospital bills are increasing rapidly and soon rehabilitation costs will pile on as well.  In addition  a week prior to Andrea’s hospitalization  she started a new job  thus resulting in the termination of her family’s health insurance on February 28th.  Andrea’s husband  Tom  must now take on the cost of a much higher COBRA Health Plan premium for their family  in addition to losing Andrea’s monthly income and the growing medical expenses. Friends and family have been asking what they can do to help  so we have set up this fundraising page to help support Andrea  Tom and their two beautiful daughters  Ashley and Sarah.  We are extremely grateful for your generosity and sincerely appreciate any amount that you are able to donate. Please keep the prayers coming!"

Her symptoms began to get worse within hours  which required fluids to alleviate her elevated heart rate and IV antibiotics at the infusion center. The second day at the infusion center  she was transferred by ambulance to IHC. Eventually she was transferred to the ICU at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City where she was finally diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.Not many people (and doctors) are aware of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) which delayed the initial diagnosis and made her case very serious  very fast.  SJS is a potentially deadly autoimmune disease that usually results from a drug reaction.  It can be caused by taking something as simple as ibuprofen.  In Allison's case  it's currently being investigated what caused the reaction. At the time of her transfer  she was receiving 3 different IV antibiotics. Another form of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Both forms of the disease can be deadly  extremely painful and distressing.  TEN manifests itself by causing the skin tissue over more than 30 percent of your body  as well as inside your mouth and throat  to begin to blister  die and detach.  This was the case with Allison  her skin rashes (or lesions) blistered and peeled and severely affected her ability to swallow and breath as the lesions attacked her mouth and went down her throat which was not only very painful but life threatening as well. It is comparable to having 3rd degree burns all over your body and inside your mouth and throat  which is why many people afflicted with SJS are often treated in Burn Units. SJS/TEN caused the top layer of Allison's skin and her mucous membranes  such as those covering her lips and eyes to peel off in waves.  Treatment was assessed at the University of Utah hospital and Allison remained in ICU for several days as her symptoms worsened.  Treatment included standard therapies used for major burns and the most severe were the lesions on her eyes.  Allison was given 20 minutes warning that they were going to perform emergency surgery to save her eyesight. It would require her to be blind for nearly two weeks  and even then there was no way to predict the outcome of the surgery.  Her eyes were sewn completely shut for nearly two weeks  she could not see anything but darkness. Allison had to be treated with high doses of steroids which were known to cause delirium and psychosis. She required 24/7 care which often was her devoted husband  Kevin  friends Misty and Jen.  Allison’s pain management was not under control  and continuously made her ill. She would wake up in the middle of the night in the midst of delusions unable to see and she did not know where she was or what was happening to her.  Symptoms persisted and worsened for up to two weeks before the skin and mucous membranes began to start to regress. Even though the lesions have begun to heal  it takes months to recover from SJS.  The surgery she had on her eyes was a success  however  she does have some residual issues seeing clearly which we hope will improve with time. Allison will be required to be followed for several years  and may require additional surgeries.  One of the most unfortunate consequences from this traumatic experience is the fact that Allison has now been diagnosed with PTSD due to the weeks of blindness  uncontrollable pain  and psychosis brought on by the IV steroids. The purpose of this Go Fund Me page is two-fold.  One  to increase the awareness of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and how it can affect anyone at any time  and two  to help the family with the enormous hospital and doctor bills they have incurred.  While Allison did have health insurance  most of the hospital expenses were considered \"out of network\" with substantial out of pocket costs. It is unclear at this time if the insurance will pay for any of the costs related to the \"experimental\" eye surgery.  We do not have a final amount of these costs yet - only an estimate  but any amount you can donate will be extremely appreciated by Allison and her family.Allison was separated from her 5 daughters for nearly one month and they are extremely happy to have her home.  She still requires nursing care and regular doctor visits and it will be many months before the peeling blisters all over her face and body will fade. There will also need to be ongoing evaluations to make sure her internal organs are not affected   Allison wishes to express her heartfelt appreciation to everyone who cared for her family in any way at all  from taking the girls overnight and to school and bringing in meals for the family.  The entire family is grateful in ways they simply cannot express in words.Sincerely Lisa West (aka: Grammie)"

To control this iron overload  Jessica has been on a chelation infusion 24/7 for the past year.  This chelation did not help reduce her iron overload.Her doctors are now concerned that she may be transitioning to aplastic anemia.Jessica is admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center where she is undergoing second round of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  As expected with chemotherapy  she is having a rough time with her symptoms and has developed heart failure and pneumonia.For the next many months  Jessica will be unable to work due to exposure to other individuals and having a weakened immune system.Her Mother is a  Special Education Teacher for the Deaf and Handicapped and is on family leave to take care of Jessica.  Her Father is a disabled war Veteran  who is unable to work. The family income has been greatly reduced.We are asking your help with Jessica and her family.  In addition to the limited family income  there are unpaid medical bills and it is also necessary to perform home modifications to ensure her safety over the next year while her new immune system develops.  In January 2019  she will not have health insurance due to her age.Thank you in advance for your assistance ... it is really appreciated.Peggy YorkovichUpdate: November 12  2018Jessica was taken for an TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) this morning.  They are concerned that she may have a heart valve defect that may need to be corrected.  A TEE allows a better/internal view of the heart's structure.  The doctors were unable to perform the procedure because she is in respiratory distress. Update: November 13  2018Finally some good news.  Sort of.  Jessica feels a little better today and the TEE was able to be performed.   The heart mitral valve defect was discovered.  One of the 2 valves was completely deformed and most of the work was done by the other part of the valve.The cardiologist feels that this can be controlled by medication for the time being.  Further evaluation and any treatment can be performed after she is discharged from the hospital.Update: November 15  2018Very unhappy little girl today.  She was expecting to come home today  but her blood counts are down  she has respiratory distress again  and nosebleeds. Another chest x-ray is going to be performed.Update: November 17  2018She's home!  Very happy to sleep in her own bed and see her puppy.   We definitely have a lot to be thankful this Thanksgiving.  Now the long road to recovery begins ...Thank you everyone for your help during these difficult times.  Happy Thanksgiving!"

Hannah has lined up a great team to help her through her journey at St. Charles Cancer Center in Bend.  Her current treatment plan includes 16 rounds of chemo over the next 5 months  followed by a double mastectomy and then radiation.Hannah’s aggressive treatment plan will pull her away from the things she loves most - riding her mountain bike  building our off-grid house  teaching mountain bike skills  cooking and traveling.  Hannah has climbed a lot of mountains in her lifetime but this will be the toughest uphill climb she’s faced yet.In addition to the unwavering support of Hannah’s parents and extended family  she has seen an overwhelming outpouring of support from her community of mountain bikers  friends  colleagues and even digital strangers who have followed her through her numerous inspiring journeys.  As you likely know  Hannah is fiercely independent and with that  a bit hesitant to acknowledge when she needs a helping hand.  But right now  she really does need our help.  Your support here will allow us to reduce the financial burden of this diagnosis and give Hannah a safe space to heal.  We are just 2 weeks into this journey and the expenses have already started to mount.  While Hannah has health insurance  living 2 hours from the cancer center will require added travel and accommodation expenses.   Additionally  Hannah will likely to be unable to work for some time.Any funds raised here will help to cover a long list of expenses including:Insurance deductible / co-insurance  fuel costs to/from St. Charles Cancer Center  accommodations 1-3 nights per week in Bend for the next 9 months  non-covered medical expenses  nourishing meals  plus anything else she may need to be comfortable during her battle.Through all this  Hannah has remained incredibly hopeful and good spirited.   We will continue to post progress updates here so you can follow along on her journey and cheer her to the cancer-free finish line.From the bottom of my heart  thank you for loving and supporting Hannah.-RichardFor those who have inquired  Hannah can receive mail at the following address:Hannah Levine6510 S 6th St #135Klamath Falls  OR97603Hannah will also continue to share her journey on instagram @hannahandvannah"

A wife  mother  daughter  sister  aunt  and friend. She is full of love and generosity. She has a sense of humor and one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know. She is mindful  optimistic  and is not someone who easily asks for help. This go fund me is not something we ever thought we would write for my sister-in-law Joanne  but she has just received her fourth cancer diagnosis in eight years. She and her family need our help now more than ever. Below is her story. Please consider donating. Any amount helps and comes at a time when she and her family need it most. First DiagnosisEight years ago  in February 2011 I got a call from my future father-in-law. Joanne  my sister-in-law to be  was just diagnosed with a brain tumor and would need surgery. I will never forget exactly where I was when I took that call. She had Hemangiopericytoma. And although we knew this was a rare and aggressive cancer  we had no idea what the extent of it would be.Joanne underwent surgery in March 2011 followed by six weeks of radiation in North Carolina where she lives with her husband Craig and her son Cole. Joanne’s brother Steve and I had a wedding planned where we live in Chicago that following August. After a life-changing surgery  the doctors did not seem worried  and Joanne recovered from what we hoped was a one-time setback. She was a bridesmaid  Cole  nine at the time  our ring bearer. We were grateful for her recovery and thought our biggest issue was how the stylist would fix her hair to cover the scar and where her head was shaved for the surgery.The Madonna Morse Family at our wedding  (August 2011)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (August 2011)Joanne gives son Cole (age 9) a kiss (August 2011)Except for a yearly brain scan  we allowed the incident to slip further into the past as we celebrated the present with Joanne. We watched Cole play basketball  graduate from eighth grade and go on to high school  took family trips to the beach in Cape May  NJ with Steve’s parents and both of his sisters  came together for Christmases  and eventually had two baby girls who Aunt Joanne showered with love and affection.Aunt Alisa with Cole (age 10) in Cape May (Summer 2012)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (Christmas 2015)Madonna Morse Family Christmas (2015)Second DiagnosisFor six years we believed Joanne to be cancer free. Then in August of 2017  just after Joanne visited us in Chicago  Joanne got another diagnosis that would have far greater consequences than the first. The hemangiopericytoma had metastasized to her liver. Scattered throughout the country  Christmas is the time the Madonna-Morse family usually comes together. For the first time in 11 years (since 2006  the year after Steve and I first met) we did not spend Christmas together as Joanne’s surgery was scheduled for the day after Christmas.Removing the entire left lobe of her liver would prove to be much more difficult and painful than her brain surgery six years prior  especially as the liver worked to regenerate itself after surgery. Recovery was long and tough. With Joanne unable to work  her husband Craig became their only source of income and health insurance. Though Craig wanted to be by Joanne’s side every moment  he could not afford to take off enough work for Joanne’s entire recovery. He chose to take time off for the surgery. Their father  Steve Sr. had also been diagnosed with cancer  multiple myeloma  and had been sick. With his parents unable to travel  Steve  Alisa and I  saved our vacation to be with Joanne in January after the surgery. Steve and I took our whole circus with – two very lively daughters that served as a much-needed distraction  and our stay was followed by time with Joanne’s sister Alisa.Uncle Steve cooks with Cole  (January 2018)Zada sits with her Aunt Joanne after the surgery - we had to keep reminding her not to jump on her aunt! (January 2018)We were all so grateful for the way Joanne’s family  friends  and community stepped up to help her  her husband Craig  and their now teenage son Cole at this time of great need. Although the recovery was hard and long  Joanne’s optimism persisted. That summer in 2017  we gathered in New Jersey to celebrate the happy news of the newest addition to our family. Alisa and her husband Brian’s newborn son  Lincoln  a rainbow baby who we had all been waiting a very long time to meet. Joanne holds baby Lincoln for the first time. (July 2018)Third DiagnosisJoanne had been through a lot. More in the last several years than some people go through in a lifetime. To celebrate  Steve’s parents wanted us to spend Christmas together as a family in Key West. We were looking forward to a much-needed beach vacation that brought us all together again and to celebrate what we hoped would be a cancer-free Joanne. The opposite happened. Several days before leaving for the trip  Joanne went to the doctor for some hip pain. Knowing her medical record  the doctor ordered a CT scan. With suitcases already packed  we got the news that her cancer had metastasized again — this time in her hip. There was danger in fracturing the hip bone  and if the hip fractured the cancer would no longer be contained  so the doctors ordered Joanne to keep the weight off her hip. We asked her what she wanted to do. Should we cancel the trip? Should we go out to North Carolina and stay with her instead? Absolutely not. She was determined to follow through with our beach Christmas. Although we were so grateful to be together  with Joanne confined to a wheelchair  we also had the ominous and visible reminder of what lay ahead for Joanne. My daughter Zada  now five  only knew that Aunt Joanne had an owie. With restricted movement  Joanne  usually the super aunt who is kind enough to babysit so that my husband and I can get a minute to ourselves  was unable to enjoy her nieces and newborn nephew in the way she so desperately wanted to  but was at least able to delight in seeing Cole with his baby cousins.To say it was heartbreaking would be an understatement. But Joanne is a fighter. She took no time to feel sorry for herself and had no time to wallow. She had an MRI scheduled the week we got back as well as an appointment with an oncologist who specializes in rare cancers. After seeing the results of the MRI scan  the Charlotte surgeon’s office called. Based on the results  they put her surgery on the schedule even before she had a chance to meet him first.__________________________________________________________________Facebook Post from Joanne 1.9.19\"It has been an extremely busy week for us. On Wednesday we met with an oncology orthopedic surgeon here in Charlotte at the Levine Cancer Institute. And today we went to Duke to meet with another surgeon (same kind) and a doctor that specializes in rare cancers and sarcomas. All 3 doctors were incredible!We have made the decision to have surgery here in Charlotte as it is closer to home and we have learned the doctor is probably the top in the state who does this and has been doing it for 25 years. So surgery is TOMORROW!We are extremely exhausted but so grateful for the opportunities to have met these wonderful specialists.Please keep us all in your prayersThere is still a lot of healing that needs to be done for all 3 of us.I thank you for all the wonderful texts  messages  calls  cards  food  love  and support we have received. It takes a village in times like these  and we are grateful for ours...especially because this has been 3 times.Love to you all! Will update sometime after surgery. ❤️❤️\"__________________________________________________________________A partial hip replacement and Joanne was on the road to recovery once again.This time her cousin Kathy flew to North Carolina from New Jersey to help out.

Why you do a FB UPDATE of course!Surgery went well...YAY! I was nauseous all day but that finally has subsided. I am in pain but grateful that it pales in comparison to last year.The doctor was able to remove the cancerous section of the bone and put a new ball and rod in. Now we wait for next steps.I’ll most likely be here for another night or two.Thank you again for being an incredible support system.Now to attempt to get a little thing called sleep before my next poke and prod session!\"__________________________________________________________________But  she has been a victim of identity theft: __________________________________________________________________ Facebook Post from Joanne 1.27.19\"I’ve been the victim of Identity Theft...But not in your typical fashion.Today I looked in the mirror and once again didn’t recognize the woman looking back at me. She was tired...haggard looking...unsure of who she is or who she’s supposed to be.This is the side of dealing with a major illness that can creep up on you. A side that is not talked about when preparing for your next round of excavating cancer from your body. The priority is of course to rid you of your cells that have gone rogue. And that’s a perfect starting point as you don’t want more cells to misbehave and have the tumor get bigger or even cause trouble in another area of your body.But what about after? I’m so incredibly grateful to be alive. I’m healing physically bit by bit each day. I’m left with more physical scars that will eventually fade...but what about the mental and emotional ones of staring your mortality down once again?That’s not as easy to heal. I’m not the same person. And some days - like today - I’m not sure who I am anymore.When you have been on survival mode for so long - you can lose sight of yourself along the way.So just as in real identity theft I am strapped in for a long haul...it will be messy...frustrating...probably will seem as it will go on forever.But I know that I’m strong and eventually will prevail. It will take some time...some tears...lots of support from family  friends  and the professionals...and most of all it will take showing myself some grace and understanding.I will regain my identity! It just may be a different - more improved - version of myself!\"__________________________________________________________________Joanne barely had the chance to regain her identity when she received her fourth and most devastating diagnosis.__________________________________________________________________Fourth DiagnosisFB Post from Joanne 2.23.2019\"Well it is time to rise again!!!I have come full circle. The cancerous tumor that was in my brain 8 years ago is now back. Busy week ahead... brain surgeon appointment ... oncology appointment at Levine Cancer Institute ... and more.Please keep us in your prayers. We sure need them! \"_______________________________________________________________________________________Dealing with the tumor in her hip put Joanne a few months behind for her annual brain scan. When she went for her brain scan after her hip surgery  we learned that her cancer has come full circle and metastasized to her brain. In the 14 years  my husband and I have been together  I can count the number of times I have seen him cry. He cried when we got married when our daughters were born when my father died  and now with this horrible news about his sister. Although Joanne has been through every emotion you can imagine  instead of dwelling on anger and the why as in “why is this happening to me?” she is focused on the what. “OK – this is my new reality  and what am I going to do about it.” I have heard her say that she is lucky  that many people have had worse to deal with. But right now  at this moment  for our family  it feels like we’ve been climbing a mountain  a mountain that continues to grow despite our tireless efforts to reach the top. And now we need your help:CT scans  MRI appointments  trips to surgeons and specialists have taken up Joanne's days and weeks. Cancer and survival have become her full-time job. This new tumor is the size of a lime under her brain behind her left eye and has already messed with the bone structure of the skull  and after seeing several specialists and having her scans reviewed by a team of surgeons  it has been determined that surgery at this point is too risky. They are recommending radiation to stop the growth of the tumor. This is not a permanent solution. Radiation will not eliminate this tumor  or even shrink it. It will only keep it from growing. The numbness on the left side of Joanne's face that is caused by the tumor will remain  but with radiation  we hope to save her eyesight. Despite having health insurance  their family already has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Beyond the radiation she will receive for this tumor  it is inevitable that she will continue with oncology appointments  visits to specialists  follow up treatments  and regular scans to detect the cancer early if it metastisizes again. Surgery may be necessary in the future and with  radiation  chemo  and the uncertainty of what future treatment she’ll need  the bills continue to pile up  and this newest diagnosis will come with tens of thousands of dollars more. As we search for alternative treatments and clinical trials  Joanne will have to travel to see specialists we hope can offer new and more successful treatment options. We are asking for your help to get her the treatment she needs. We are asking because all we can do is support her and her family by alleviating some of the financial burdens of costly doctor’s appointments and medical treatments so their family may focus on the monumental endeavor of survival.When her son Cole asks what he can do because he feels like he is not doing enough for his mom  she tells him the best thing he can do for her is to focus on being a teenager. Keep his grades up  stick with extracurriculars  and live his best high school experience. Let’s help Cole live his best high school experience and do all we can to ensure his mom is there for his high school graduation  his college graduation and beyond. Thank you so much for donating. We have endless appreciation for your generosity under these most difficult of circumstances. #CancerCantKeepJoDown"

Katharine started to feel a little under the weather about a month ago. She shrugged it off  kept helping out with her family and non-profits. Under the weather became flu-like with some back pain. A close friend finally dragged her to the doctor. Sadly  it was not the flu.In the course of a month  Inflammatory Breast Cancer had moved rapidly from her breast to her lymph nodes to her liver and spine.  IBC is a very fast moving and aggressive cancer -a terrible foe. Katharine spent most of the last week in the ICU at Newton-Wellesley fighting for her life. She's through the first round of chemo  and her liver and kidneys are now fighting to clear her blood stream of the chemo and dead tumor cells. She'll be in the hospital until they catch up  and will face weeks of chemo ahead. IBC is generally pretty responsive to chemo  but Katharine has a huge fight ahead of her.We're hoping that you'll help pick up the fight with her. As many of you know  Katharine has worked for a variety of non-profits  trading the fulfillment of the work for the safety of a corporate job. Her work helping others doesn't come with those little insurance perks  like disability insurance  that are so incredibly helpful at a time like this.So this is our Crusade for Katharine. We're raising money to help pay the bills.

"Medical","January 22, 2019","Help Breanne Beat Cancer","$20,787","$100,000","231","2","234","684","ATLANTA","GA","I woke up in the middle of the night lying in a pool of blood. That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am  as blood poured out of my body in sheets  a terrifying reality struck: I was alone  1200 miles from home  unemployed  without health insurance  and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home  near my family to face this crisis. So  I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later  I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once  I stopped to catch my breath  arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30  my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival  I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. \"I don’t belong here  I thought.\" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests  nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food  and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion ” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning  doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure  my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said  “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat  perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know ” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later  they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs  but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum  resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging  on December 18th  they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer  especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like  or what it feels like  or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase  but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place  unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration  and any amount remaining following an injection  is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore  according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called  The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies   “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival  BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy  some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight  which may or may not go away  hair loss  loss of appetite  nausea  unusual tiredness or fatigue  dizziness  “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation  brain fog  and cognitive impairment —which can last for years  changes in vision  sores in mouth or throat  diarrhea  vomiting  impaired immune system function  rash  hives  itching  difficulty breathing/swallowing  nosebleeds  coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!)  pink  red  or dark brown urine  unusual bleeding or bruising  and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer  so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old  but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs  therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression  loss of identity  and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug  doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs  which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo  approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning  even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test  Caris test). So  I asked my oncologist  who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately  if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take  but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy  visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil  the drug my doctor has prescribed for me  and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy  each 12 to 16-weeks long  I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects  high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation  my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries  five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea  rectal bleeding  bladder and vaginal irritation  redness and itching to the treated area  brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis)  sexual side effects  and incontinence—or more commonly  the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So  in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery  I get to wear an adult diaper  just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes  too?If you’re still reading at this point  perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is  yes  there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is  the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates  the father of modern medicine said  “first  do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus  I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books  Chris Beat Cancer   by Chris Wark  and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life   by David Servan-Schreiber  MD  PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside  one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed  but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But  since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food  whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice  and in less than a month  I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural  holistic  or alternative medicines in the United States  and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland  Greece  and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A  IV-vitamin C  IV-mistletoe  IV-curcumin  far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells  hyperbolic oxygen chamber  Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment  acupuncture  mind-body therapy  and many  many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer  healthier alternative to healing cancer  they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life  I’ve been called stupid  and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend  then I do not have their support. At times  I’ve never felt more alone. So  I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers  I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now  I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money  especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue  no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents  I now have insurance  but due to the circumstances of my health crisis  I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me  that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that  no matter what  I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive  least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you  I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar. Donate a word of advice or recommendation to a doctor. Forward my story to friends or someone you know that may be able to help. Share with me your stories of success and failure when you were battling your own illnesses. Say a prayer for my healing. I can’t promise I will ever be able to pay back the money I hope to raise  but I can promise to pay it forward. I can promise to be an advocate for health and nutrition; I can promise to keep you informed every step of the way; and I can promise to help the next person in line who finds themselves in my situation—terrified and fighting for her life with a glimmer of hope that toxic medicine isn’t the way to survival.

He was very excited to be graduating magna cum laude in May and was looking forward to getting a great job in the aviation industry.On Friday  1/11  Matt was riding his motorcycle home from work as a teaching assistant at ERAU when a car cut him off  sending him flying more than 80 feet from the point of impact! He suffered two broken legs  a broken hand  a skull fracture and broke his back in two places.The other driver  a woman who was out of jail on bond for drug charges  was cited for the accident. Unfortunately she had no liability coverage and her insurance will pay only $10 000 of Matt’s medical costs. ... which is barely a drop in the bucket of what likely already exceeds $100 000. Matt’s student health insurance will pay some of the bills but there are loads of expenses that Matt’s family has already incurred with no end in sight.Matt is an amazing young man with a great future. Just as he has surmounted all kinds of difficulties —including his dad’s sudden death — in the past  he is determined to recover fully and return to ERAU in either the summer or the fall to finish his degree. But he needs help to meet the ever-rising expenses caused to him by no fault of his own.Those will include the cost of skilled nursing for a month or so to help him recuperate from his injuries enough to go into intensive inpatient rehabilitation and then the support he needs to transition home (probably in a wheelchair).His mom and brother have been in Florida since the day of the accident and are doing everything they can to help him as he heals from these awful injuries. We want to help them by raising $25 000 to meet some of Matt’s many related expenses including copays and deductibles.Lots of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help. The answer is yes: please donate here to  Matt Deckman's Recovery Fund. Then  you can \"like\" and \"share\" with your family and friends and ask them to lend a hand.

She and her family need our help now more than ever. Below is her story. Please consider donating. Any amount helps and comes at a time when she and her family need it most. First DiagnosisEight years ago  in February 2011 I got a call from my future father-in-law. Joanne  my sister-in-law to be  was just diagnosed with a brain tumor and would need surgery. I will never forget exactly where I was when I took that call. She had Hemangiopericytoma. And although we knew this was a rare and aggressive cancer  we had no idea what the extent of it would be.Joanne underwent surgery in March 2011 followed by six weeks of radiation in North Carolina where she lives with her husband Craig and her son Cole. Joanne’s brother Steve and I had a wedding planned where we live in Chicago that following August. After a life-changing surgery  the doctors did not seem worried  and Joanne recovered from what we hoped was a one-time setback. She was a bridesmaid  Cole  nine at the time  our ring bearer. We were grateful for her recovery and thought our biggest issue was how the stylist would fix her hair to cover the scar and where her head was shaved for the surgery.The Madonna Morse Family at our wedding  (August 2011)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (August 2011)Joanne gives son Cole (age 9) a kiss (August 2011)Except for a yearly brain scan  we allowed the incident to slip further into the past as we celebrated the present with Joanne. We watched Cole play basketball  graduate from eighth grade and go on to high school  took family trips to the beach in Cape May  NJ with Steve’s parents and both of his sisters  came together for Christmases  and eventually had two baby girls who Aunt Joanne showered with love and affection.Aunt Alisa with Cole (age 10) in Cape May (Summer 2012)Joanne with brother Steve and sister Alisa (Christmas 2015)Madonna Morse Family Christmas (2015)Second DiagnosisFor six years we believed Joanne to be cancer free. Then in August of 2017  just after Joanne visited us in Chicago  Joanne got another diagnosis that would have far greater consequences than the first. The hemangiopericytoma had metastasized to her liver. Scattered throughout the country  Christmas is the time the Madonna-Morse family usually comes together. For the first time in 11 years (since 2006  the year after Steve and I first met) we did not spend Christmas together as Joanne’s surgery was scheduled for the day after Christmas.Removing the entire left lobe of her liver would prove to be much more difficult and painful than her brain surgery six years prior  especially as the liver worked to regenerate itself after surgery. Recovery was long and tough. With Joanne unable to work  her husband Craig became their only source of income and health insurance. Though Craig wanted to be by Joanne’s side every moment  he could not afford to take off enough work for Joanne’s entire recovery. He chose to take time off for the surgery. Their father  Steve Sr. had also been diagnosed with cancer  multiple myeloma  and had been sick. With his parents unable to travel  Steve  Alisa and I  saved our vacation to be with Joanne in January after the surgery. Steve and I took our whole circus with – two very lively daughters that served as a much-needed distraction  and our stay was followed by time with Joanne’s sister Alisa.Uncle Steve cooks with Cole  (January 2018)Zada sits with her Aunt Joanne after the surgery - we had to keep reminding her not to jump on her aunt! (January 2018)We were all so grateful for the way Joanne’s family  friends  and community stepped up to help her  her husband Craig  and their now teenage son Cole at this time of great need. Although the recovery was hard and long  Joanne’s optimism persisted. That summer in 2017  we gathered in New Jersey to celebrate the happy news of the newest addition to our family. Alisa and her husband Brian’s newborn son  Lincoln  a rainbow baby who we had all been waiting a very long time to meet. Joanne holds baby Lincoln for the first time. (July 2018)Third DiagnosisJoanne had been through a lot. More in the last several years than some people go through in a lifetime. To celebrate  Steve’s parents wanted us to spend Christmas together as a family in Key West. We were looking forward to a much-needed beach vacation that brought us all together again and to celebrate what we hoped would be a cancer-free Joanne. The opposite happened. Several days before leaving for the trip  Joanne went to the doctor for some hip pain. Knowing her medical record  the doctor ordered a CT scan. With suitcases already packed  we got the news that her cancer had metastasized again — this time in her hip. There was danger in fracturing the hip bone  and if the hip fractured the cancer would no longer be contained  so the doctors ordered Joanne to keep the weight off her hip. We asked her what she wanted to do. Should we cancel the trip? Should we go out to North Carolina and stay with her instead? Absolutely not. She was determined to follow through with our beach Christmas. Although we were so grateful to be together  with Joanne confined to a wheelchair  we also had the ominous and visible reminder of what lay ahead for Joanne. My daughter Zada  now five  only knew that Aunt Joanne had an owie. With restricted movement  Joanne  usually the super aunt who is kind enough to babysit so that my husband and I can get a minute to ourselves  was unable to enjoy her nieces and newborn nephew in the way she so desperately wanted to  but was at least able to delight in seeing Cole with his baby cousins.To say it was heartbreaking would be an understatement. But Joanne is a fighter. She took no time to feel sorry for herself and had no time to wallow. She had an MRI scheduled the week we got back as well as an appointment with an oncologist who specializes in rare cancers. After seeing the results of the MRI scan  the Charlotte surgeon’s office called. Based on the results  they put her surgery on the schedule even before she had a chance to meet him first.__________________________________________________________________Facebook Post from Joanne 1.9.19\"It has been an extremely busy week for us. On Wednesday we met with an oncology orthopedic surgeon here in Charlotte at the Levine Cancer Institute. And today we went to Duke to meet with another surgeon (same kind) and a doctor that specializes in rare cancers and sarcomas. All 3 doctors were incredible!We have made the decision to have surgery here in Charlotte as it is closer to home and we have learned the doctor is probably the top in the state who does this and has been doing it for 25 years. So surgery is TOMORROW!We are extremely exhausted but so grateful for the opportunities to have met these wonderful specialists.Please keep us all in your prayersThere is still a lot of healing that needs to be done for all 3 of us.I thank you for all the wonderful texts  messages  calls  cards  food  love  and support we have received. It takes a village in times like these  and we are grateful for ours...especially because this has been 3 times.Love to you all! Will update sometime after surgery. ❤️❤️\"__________________________________________________________________A partial hip replacement and Joanne was on the road to recovery once again.This time her cousin Kathy flew to North Carolina from New Jersey to help out.

She was tired...haggard looking...unsure of who she is or who she’s supposed to be.This is the side of dealing with a major illness that can creep up on you. A side that is not talked about when preparing for your next round of excavating cancer from your body. The priority is of course to rid you of your cells that have gone rogue. And that’s a perfect starting point as you don’t want more cells to misbehave and have the tumor get bigger or even cause trouble in another area of your body.But what about after? I’m so incredibly grateful to be alive. I’m healing physically bit by bit each day. I’m left with more physical scars that will eventually fade...but what about the mental and emotional ones of staring your mortality down once again?That’s not as easy to heal. I’m not the same person. And some days - like today - I’m not sure who I am anymore.When you have been on survival mode for so long - you can lose sight of yourself along the way.So just as in real identity theft I am strapped in for a long haul...it will be messy...frustrating...probably will seem as it will go on forever.But I know that I’m strong and eventually will prevail. It will take some time...some tears...lots of support from family  friends  and the professionals...and most of all it will take showing myself some grace and understanding.I will regain my identity!

The cancerous tumor that was in my brain 8 years ago is now back. Busy week ahead... brain surgeon appointment ... oncology appointment at Levine Cancer Institute ... and more.Please keep us in your prayers. We sure need them! \"_______________________________________________________________________________________Dealing with the tumor in her hip put Joanne a few months behind for her annual brain scan. When she went for her brain scan after her hip surgery  we learned that her cancer has come full circle and metastasized to her brain. In the 14 years  my husband and I have been together  I can count the number of times I have seen him cry. He cried when we got married when our daughters were born when my father died  and now with this horrible news about his sister. Although Joanne has been through every emotion you can imagine  instead of dwelling on anger and the why as in “why is this happening to me?” she is focused on the what. “OK – this is my new reality  and what am I going to do about it.” I have heard her say that she is lucky  that many people have had worse to deal with. But right now  at this moment  for our family  it feels like we’ve been climbing a mountain  a mountain that continues to grow despite our tireless efforts to reach the top. And now we need your help:CT scans  MRI appointments  trips to surgeons and specialists have taken up Joanne's days and weeks. Cancer and survival have become her full-time job. This new tumor is the size of a lime under her brain behind her left eye and has already messed with the bone structure of the skull  and after seeing several specialists and having her scans reviewed by a team of surgeons  it has been determined that surgery at this point is too risky. They are recommending radiation to stop the growth of the tumor. This is not a permanent solution. Radiation will not eliminate this tumor  or even shrink it. It will only keep it from growing. The numbness on the left side of Joanne's face that is caused by the tumor will remain  but with radiation  we hope to save her eyesight. Despite having health insurance  their family already has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Beyond the radiation she will receive for this tumor  it is inevitable that she will continue with oncology appointments  visits to specialists  follow up treatments  and regular scans to detect the cancer early if it metastisizes again. Surgery may be necessary in the future and with  radiation  chemo  and the uncertainty of what future treatment she’ll need  the bills continue to pile up  and this newest diagnosis will come with tens of thousands of dollars more. As we search for alternative treatments and clinical trials  Joanne will have to travel to see specialists we hope can offer new and more successful treatment options. We are asking for your help to get her the treatment she needs. We are asking because all we can do is support her and her family by alleviating some of the financial burdens of costly doctor’s appointments and medical treatments so their family may focus on the monumental endeavor of survival.When her son Cole asks what he can do because he feels like he is not doing enough for his mom  she tells him the best thing he can do for her is to focus on being a teenager. Keep his grades up  stick with extracurriculars  and live his best high school experience. Let’s help Cole live his best high school experience and do all we can to ensure his mom is there for his high school graduation  his college graduation and beyond. Thank you so much for donating. We have endless appreciation for your generosity under these most difficult of circumstances. #CancerCantKeepJoDown"

Katharine started to feel a little under the weather about a month ago. She shrugged it off  kept helping out with her family and non-profits. Under the weather became flu-like with some back pain. A close friend finally dragged her to the doctor. Sadly  it was not the flu.In the course of a month  Inflammatory Breast Cancer had moved rapidly from her breast to her lymph nodes to her liver and spine.  IBC is a very fast moving and aggressive cancer -a terrible foe. Katharine spent most of the last week in the ICU at Newton-Wellesley fighting for her life. She's through the first round of chemo  and her liver and kidneys are now fighting to clear her blood stream of the chemo and dead tumor cells. She'll be in the hospital until they catch up  and will face weeks of chemo ahead. IBC is generally pretty responsive to chemo  but Katharine has a huge fight ahead of her.We're hoping that you'll help pick up the fight with her. As many of you know  Katharine has worked for a variety of non-profits  trading the fulfillment of the work for the safety of a corporate job. Her work helping others doesn't come with those little insurance perks  like disability insurance  that are so incredibly helpful at a time like this.So this is our Crusade for Katharine. We're raising money to help pay the bills. Katharine has health insurance  but there will be deductibles  co-pays  rent  power  food  transportation etc.  and unfortunately being there for others doesn't pay a lot. I hope you'll be there for Katharine.*Note:* This campaign is run by Isabel Roberts  Katharine's daughter. All donations will be withdrawn by Isabel solely to to pay Katharine's rent  bills and medical expenses during this time."

"Medical","January 22, 2019","Help Breanne Beat Cancer","$20,787","$100,000","231","2","234","684","ATLANTA","GA","I woke up in the middle of the night lying in a pool of blood. That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am  as blood poured out of my body in sheets  a terrifying reality struck: I was alone  1200 miles from home  unemployed  without health insurance  and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home  near my family to face this crisis. So  I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later  I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once  I stopped to catch my breath  arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30  my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival  I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. \"I don’t belong here  I thought.\" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests  nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food  and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion ” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning  doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure  my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said  “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat  perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know ” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later  they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs  but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum  resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging  on December 18th  they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer  especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like  or what it feels like  or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy  five weeks of radiation  then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase  but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place  unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration  and any amount remaining following an injection  is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore  according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called  The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies   “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival  BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy  some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight  which may or may not go away  hair loss  loss of appetite  nausea  unusual tiredness or fatigue  dizziness  “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation  brain fog  and cognitive impairment —which can last for years  changes in vision  sores in mouth or throat  diarrhea  vomiting  impaired immune system function  rash  hives  itching  difficulty breathing/swallowing  nosebleeds  coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!)  pink  red  or dark brown urine  unusual bleeding or bruising  and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer  so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old  but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs  therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression  loss of identity  and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug  doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs  which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo  approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning  even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test  Caris test). So  I asked my oncologist  who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately  if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take  but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy  visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil  the drug my doctor has prescribed for me  and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy  each 12 to 16-weeks long  I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects  high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation  my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries  five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea  rectal bleeding  bladder and vaginal irritation  redness and itching to the treated area  brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis)  sexual side effects  and incontinence—or more commonly  the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So  in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery  I get to wear an adult diaper  just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes  too?If you’re still reading at this point  perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is  yes  there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is  the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates  the father of modern medicine said  “first  do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus  I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books  Chris Beat Cancer   by Chris Wark  and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life   by David Servan-Schreiber  MD  PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside  one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed  but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But  since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food  whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice  and in less than a month  I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural  holistic  or alternative medicines in the United States  and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland  Greece  and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A  IV-vitamin C  IV-mistletoe  IV-curcumin  far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells  hyperbolic oxygen chamber  Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment  acupuncture  mind-body therapy  and many  many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer  healthier alternative to healing cancer  they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life  I’ve been called stupid  and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend  then I do not have their support. At times  I’ve never felt more alone. So  I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers  I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer  A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now  I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money  especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue  no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents  I now have insurance  but due to the circumstances of my health crisis  I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me  that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that  no matter what  I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive  least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you  I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar. Donate a word of advice or recommendation to a doctor. Forward my story to friends or someone you know that may be able to help. Share with me your stories of success and failure when you were battling your own illnesses. Say a prayer for my healing. I can’t promise I will ever be able to pay back the money I hope to raise  but I can promise to pay it forward. I can promise to be an advocate for health and nutrition; I can promise to keep you informed every step of the way; and I can promise to help the next person in line who finds themselves in my situation—terrified and fighting for her life with a glimmer of hope that toxic medicine isn’t the way to survival.

As you might know  Matt began his last semester at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach FL two weeks ago. He was very excited to be graduating magna cum laude in May and was looking forward to getting a great job in the aviation industry.On Friday  1/11  Matt was riding his motorcycle home from work as a teaching assistant at ERAU when a car cut him off  sending him flying more than 80 feet from the point of impact! He suffered two broken legs  a broken hand  a skull fracture and broke his back in two places.The other driver  a woman who was out of jail on bond for drug charges  was cited for the accident. Unfortunately she had no liability coverage and her insurance will pay only $10 000 of Matt’s medical costs. ... which is barely a drop in the bucket of what likely already exceeds $100 000. Matt’s student health insurance will pay some of the bills but there are loads of expenses that Matt’s family has already incurred with no end in sight.Matt is an amazing young man with a great future. Just as he has surmounted all kinds of difficulties —including his dad’s sudden death — in the past  he is determined to recover fully and return to ERAU in either the summer or the fall to finish his degree. But he needs help to meet the ever-rising expenses caused to him by no fault of his own.Those will include the cost of skilled nursing for a month or so to help him recuperate from his injuries enough to go into intensive inpatient rehabilitation and then the support he needs to transition home (probably in a wheelchair).His mom and brother have been in Florida since the day of the accident and are doing everything they can to help him as he heals from these awful injuries. We want to help them by raising $25 000 to meet some of Matt’s many related expenses including copays and deductibles.Lots of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help. The answer is yes: please donate here to  Matt Deckman's Recovery Fund. Then  you can \"like\" and \"share\" with your family and friends and ask them to lend a hand.

"Medical","March 6, 2019","Help Amanda fight Triple Negative Breast Cancer","$19,345","$16,500","175","1","174","830","JORDAN","MN","Just before Thanksgiving of this past year  our sister  Amanda Burton  shared the shocking news that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. After further testing  she was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: Stage IIIC Breast Cancer. PET scans showed that it had spread to her lymph nodes. Amanda has been diagnosed with a fairly rare and aggressive form  called Triple Negative. It was difficult to wrap our heads around her diagnosis  as Amanda is only 37  and has two young children (Jefferson - 6 years old  Lennon - 2 years old). Amanda is currently receiving her care through Minnesota Oncology and the Piper Breast Center in Minneapolis. Her particular subtype of breast cancer  Triple Negative  limits her treatment options. A diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer means that the three most common types of receptors known to fuel most breast cancer growth–estrogen  progesterone  and the HER-2/neu gene– are not present in the cancer. Since the tumor cells lack the necessary receptors  common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen  progesterone  and HER-2 are ineffective. Using chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer is still an effective option. In fact  triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in the earlier stages than many other forms of cancer. Amanda began chemotherapy at the end of November 2018 and should be wrapping up in April. After discovering some damage to her veins from the chemo infusion process  Amanda had surgery to insert a portacath (a device providing a direct line for infusions to a larger vein)  to ease the process and prevent additional damage. Her chemotherapy treatment consists of two phases and 16 total treatments. Post chemo  she will undergo additional imaging to determine the effectiveness of the chemo at reducing the known tumors. Based on the results of the imaging  doctor recommendations  and Amanda’s preferences she will have surgery. The preliminary surgical outlook is a mastectomy. While a chance exists that Amanda’s tumors will shrink enough for a lumpectomy  the likelihood of this less invasive procedure is limited  at best. After receiving a course ofradiation treatment  Amanda will undergo reconstructive surgeries  and a lifetime of ongoing testing to determine if her cancer is still in remission. Whereas no guarantee exists her treatments will cure Amanda’s cancer  her medical team is confident that she is on a path to recovery and optimistic that her outcome will be positive. This seems an entirely unfair experience for someone with such a loving  giving  and genuine heart (though we know that's not how the Universe works)! At the same time  we've never known a stronger  more determined fighter than Amanda  and are convinced she will conquer this  as well. Amanda has a supportive husband  Travis  and two amazing little boys that keep her battling each day. She is also blessed with a supportive network of friends as well as co-workers  and an extended family unit that is giving her love and support every step of the way. While there is little we can do to ease the physical and emotional toll of this experience  we are hoping to help Amanda with the intense financial burden that cancer has brought. Though Amanda does have health insurance  it doesn't begin to fully cover all the expenses. We would ideally like to raise $16 500. This money will go toward covering additional health insurance costs from out-of-pocket expenses  deductibles for the years 2018-2020 including but not limited to: chemotherapy  mastectomy and reconstruction  radiation  various oral medications  medical scans (PET  MRI  etc.)  and portacath surgery.  We are immensely grateful for any and all donations! We know that a financial gift is not possible for everyone  but hope you will consider sharing Amanda's story with your friends and networks. We'd love to meet our goal by the end of March to give Amanda an additional boost as she finishes chemotherapy treatment and begins the second phase of her road to recovery. We would also appreciate any prayers  love  and positive energy you could send her way!With love and gratitude Amanda's sisters  Emily Lewandowski & Molly Stangby     PS: GoFundMe no longer takes 5% of donations!

Jim was rushed to Boston Medical where he received lifesaving treatments  including a craniectomy to relieve the increasing pressure/swelling in his brain. In the early months  the goal was on helping Jim stay alive. After a month in a coma  Jim began to regain consciousness. By June  Jim's family was elated when he was accepted to Spaulding Rehab in Charlestown  where we all hoped he would progress enough to eventually regain enough function to allow him to return home to his wife  Krissy  and their 6 year old son  John. Unfortunately  only a few days into his stay at Spaulding  Jim became gravely ill with sepsis and pneumonia  and was quickly moved back to Boston Medical. The prognosis at that point was not good  and Jim's family began to prepare for the possibility that Jim may not survive the ordeal. Miraculously  his condition slowly began to turn around. His physical health improved enough to allow him to be discharged to Spaulding Cambridge  where he could receive intense medical and nursing attention and still participate in some rehab as he was able. Since then  Jim has made progress amidst setbacks. He is currently in a nursing facility in Milton  where he was transferred in November  after a number of months in Spaulding Cambridge. The progress he has made since early December has been incredible... he is able to stand with support for brief periods  he has tried to speak a bit more each day  and on a daily basis we see the \"Jim\" we know and love come back to us more and more. He smiles and laughs (and saves his biggest smiles for his son John). He and John play catch with a small football. It is so uplifting and heartwarming to watch. Unfortunately  now that Jim is at a point where physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech therapy are more critical than ever to ensure his continued progress  his health insurance company is refusing to pay for further therapy.  At this point  Krissy has been purchasing the equipment he needs at the nursing facility (from tracheotomoy caps to orthotic boots) out of her own pocket.Jim has always been a proud guy and has never liked asking for help. Out of respect for that  I have held off on creating this page. However  as the months go on and Jim's needs for therapy increase and his health insurance runs out  and as it becomes clearer that returning to work in the future is not something we can count on  I feel compelled to take action to help him  Krissy  and John in any tangible way I can. Krissy  in the midst of all of this upheaval  stress  uncertainty  and sadness in her own life  has amazingly found it in her heart to help other families in need and to devote her time to other charitable efforts. So many have stepped up to help in various ways in these past few months  and our family is eternally grateful for the support. The hope in this fundraising effort is to support Jim's family with his healthcare expenses and to relieve the financial burdens associated with Jim's condition."

At the time  she was told she was allergic to something in the air and therefore she didn’t think much about it. Two months ago  she visited her doctor to get checked for the possibility of skin cancer. Fortunately  there were no signs of skin cancer but it was this appointment where she brought up the lingering cough again to verify the “allergy”. The doctor recommended getting an X-ray and from there  multiple tests and procedures were performed over the past few months. Results finally came in on November 6th  and Bernice was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin’s Lymphoma at age 25.Treatment: Bernice currently is on medical leave on orders from her oncologist. Her first of six chemotherapy cycles was on November 27th and it went a lot better than anticipated. She is currently resting at home with minor side affects and a good appetite. After the fourth cycle in January  a PET scan will be done to re-evaluate if radiation would be needed after chemo.Funds: Bernice is not under her parents’ insurance since both have limited employment.

She is an Afro-Latina woman from Puerto Rico and has been the Executive Director of Mothers on the Move for nearly 2 decades. Her unwavering commitment to poor  disenfranchised people of color has been a staple of her commitment to our movements and served as a source of inspiration for countless folks like me.  When people  communities  or organizations have needed support  Wanda often has been the first person to show up  selflessly offering herself and whatever resources were available to her at the time. She has never been one to offer support and leave. For so many  she provides support and sticks around until a sustainable transformation occurs that allows her to move onto the next person or organization that needs authentic love and support.  We call her Wanda Woman because it is a moniker she has worked towards her entire life.WHY YOUR HELP MATTERSWhile Wanda’s story of leadership and power may be a unique story amongst movement leaders  being a woman of color  underpaid  and without health insurance is a far too common story we hear.  In typical Wanda fashion  when the ED of an organization was diagnosed with cancer  Wanda stepped into the Interim Director role to ensure the work and the team of that organization continued to be supported  without interruption. And it cost her — big time. For months  Wanda pushed herself  running two organizations and supporting two teams and many communities. And finally  almost a month ago  the stress and sheer magnitude of work  caught up to her and hit her hard.  Wanda has been hospitalized for extreme physical exhaustion that has deeply wounded her mentally  physically  and spiritually. Now  more than ever before  she needs us. She needs all of us. YOUR SUPPORT IS ABOUT HEALINGAfter 40 years of unrelenting movement dedication and work  and the recent life-altering event that has forced Wanda (and all of us) to take toll of the real cost of doing social change work  Wanda needs a real sabbatical to heal physically  mentally  and spiritually. Our bodies are not machines  and it will scream at us to stop and take care  even when we refuse to listen. And life presents us with many opportunities to understand the vital lessons are bodies force us to learn.  Your support offers time for Wanda to heal  while simultaneously providing you a chance to take part in the learning this life lesson has to offer us. Will you join us in supporting Wanda’s much-needed healing by helping us raise money to:·      Allow Wanda to stop working for five months and get her healing on  truly.·      Cover her rent and living costs for this period ·      Support Wanda to return home  to Puerto Rico  where her elders and family can care for her and so she may heal from the ocean.·      Provide Wanda with holistic and integral health practices  including healing foods and programs. DEEP BOW OF GRATITUDEAny support you can offer  whether through donating or sharing this fundraiser  means so much to so many  especially Wanda.  Your support begins by helping Wanda take time to heal trulyand carries over to all the folks and communities Wanda will no doubt resume supporting once she returns to her life’s purpose and work.  For your support  whatever it may be  we are deeply grateful.With much love and appreciation Marcia OlivoZaida SalamanRusia MohiuddinMaria MohiuddinJanvieve Williams- Comrie"

I don't have health insurance and  3 days ago I had surgery to remove the necrotic flesh that is spreading inside of my leg. The surgery was a failure and also simultaneously bankrupted me.  The incision in my leg has burst open and There is now new necrotic dying flesh growing in my leg.   In this time of incredible physical and emotional suffering any donation no matter how small to help me to afford my upcoming surgeries to save my leg is something I will be eternally grateful for. The first surgery was paid out of pocket and was in the area of 10 thousand dollars. I have at least 2 more surgeries I need but do not have financial means to pay for them.  These surgeries will also be more costly than the first. Please help me  please share this on every social media you have. I have no where to turn. - Dan Marquis \"bodybuilder in Thailand\""

He has spent the past week at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN where doctors are still perplexed. The closest thing to a diagnosis is that Spencer's e-coli infection from December of last year has left his nervous system in over drive. Spencer's unknown illness prompts episodes of elevated heart rate (almost 200 beats per minutes at times)  inability to breath  and muscle failure due to lactic acid build up. Multiple times he has collapsed simply trying to walk from the car to the house and had to be taken to the emergency room. In addition to this  his symptoms now include mental confusion and the inability to walk more than just a short distance.Spencer is unable to work during this time and as a result has lost his health insurance. He cannot be added to my parent's insurance as he is over the age of 26.  While he does have insurance through the state of Massachusetts  this insurance does not cover out of state costs at specialty hospitals such as the Mayo Clinic where he is now.The Mayo Clinic has recommended that Spencer receive treatment  focused on resetting his entire nervous system.  This includes physical and occupational therapy  and even cognitive behavior adjustments. The bulk of the funds raised here will go to funding the related costs for this program. Unfortunately this program costs around $50 000 in addition to the 10's of thousand my parents have already spent .Unfortunately  my family simply does not have this amount of money to spare at this time. We are asking for your help. Any amount will help and be greatly appreciated. Let's help Spencer get back on his feet and on the pathway to a normal life. Cheers Matt"

Ann was recently diagnosed with a condition called hyperparathyroid disease. She is scheduled to have surgery on February 13th at the Norman Parathyroid Center in Tampa  Florida. This center is the world's leading treatment center dedicated to hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid surgery. They will be removing one or more tumors from Ann's parathyroid glands. Unfortunately  the Norman Parathyroid Center does not accept Ann’s health insurance. She has explored other hospitals and doctors that do this procedure  but there are risks involved  as they do not have the expertise and technology that this center has available. Their website states  “About 10% of our practice is on patients who had a failed operation somewhere else  and about a third of them have lost their voice.” Clearly  the best option is for Ann to have her surgery at this Center.So dear relatives  this request is to ask for your help to open the path for healing for our dear Ann. Your prayers and financial support are deeply appreciated at a time that has been somewhat stressful for Ann and Bob. It is our prayer that she receives the best care and treatment available so that the gift of her voice and health is not compromised in any way.Thank you for your support and prayers! #TeamAnn________________________________________________________ FOLLOWING IS AN OUTLINE OF THE IMMEDIATE GOAL:Surgery:  $14 000Transportation (air & ground)  lodging  diet  and miscellaneous expenses: $4 500✩ TOTAL: $18 500________________________________________________________ Below is a 6-minute video link describing hyperparathyroid disease and the procedure: Below are a few words of gratitude from Ann:Dear friends and relations I am so grateful.The Holy One continues to humble me  and allow me to fulfill my heart-of-hearts prayer to be in loving service.This fall  through routine blood tests  I found I have a condition called hyperparathyroid disease. Further tests and x-rays have shown I have at least one tumor in my neck  which needs to be removed.

We are asking for your help to finance Ted’s ongoing recovery from stage 3A lung cancer.My dad is equal parts watchful and goofy; hardworking and adventurous; strong and humble. He is an amazing dad  a loving husband  and a family chef most people only dream about!He is also a dedicated Chicago Public School teacher. Last summer  my dad was diagnosed with Stage 3A lung cancer. He started chemotherapy and radiation treatments right away in an effort to shrink the baseball-sized tumor in his right lung with surgery to follow.We were very lucky. The radiation and chemotherapy treatments worked as the doctors hoped  however  the last two rounds of chemo were very difficult for Ted. He lost a lot of weight and much of his strength. Still  our team of doctors at Rush were very hopeful that Ted would recover.In October  Ted underwent surgery to remove the tumor  a portion of his right lung  as well as several ribs. He came home shortly thereafter  but quickly returned to the hospital when complications arose. Ted was struggling to breathe and experiencing dizziness  nausea  and anxiety. Residual effects from his chemotherapy treatments persisted. We learned that Ted had pneumonia and empyema (a collection of pus in the lung cavity)  along with a gastrointestinal infection. Over the course of the next several weeks  Ted’s doctors worked to save what remained of his right lung  which involved daily  painful bronchoscopies. Ultimately  the medical team decided to remove the lung in order to avoid infection in his left  healthy lung.Shortly after my dad’s pneumonectomy (surgery to remove his lung)  he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. It was latent  non-infectious tuberculosis  likely contracted prior to his cancer diagnosis which became active when his immune system was compromised. He continues to be treated for tuberculosis  but is no longer infectious.Ted’s recovery has been unbelievably difficult. Since November  he has lived life from various hospital and rehabilitation beds. He has a catheter  and a feeding tube to nourish his deconditioned body while he learns how to swallow without food aspirating into his remaining lung. At 6 feet tall  he weighs just slightly more than 130 pounds. He is relearning to walk  write  shave  use the toilet  and breathe efficiently. Every day  his chest cavity is unpacked and re-packed from a 3” x 4” opening under his armpit  the goal being for the entire chest cavity to heal from the inside out. He completes daily intensive speech/swallow therapy  occupational therapy  and physical therapy.Here is a photo of my dad now  smiling as he works in speech therapy. My mom visits him every day. She does his PT and OT homework with him and encourages him to try new mushed up foods. She grades her classroom papers from his bedside while rubbing his legs.Very soon  my dad will have maxed out his health insurance coverage for his rehabilitation stay  and he will come home. When he does  he will need considerable  costly support  as the setbacks he has encountered in this season have significantly delayed his healing. While we expect that things like wound care supplies  a standard wheelchair  and a commode will be covered by insurance  we know that a whole range of things  like physical  occupational  and speech therapy  will not. Clare  my mom  will be responsible for wound care  tube feedings  catheter maintenance  and more. Family and friends will be pitching in  too.Also  this summer  Clare and Ted’s insurance situation is likely to change. My dad will go on Medicare and my mom will need to pay for a comprehensive health insurance policy (she does not receive health benefits as an adjunct faculty member at Columbia College).As we navigate this next chapter of my dad’s recovery  we recognize the financial challenges that lay ahead and we find ourselves in the position of needing to ask for help. We do not do so lightly.FINANCIAL NEEDS BREAKDOWN:In-home nursing care -  $750/ week for 50 Weeks =  $37 500Oxygen -  estimating $400/month won't be covered by insurance. Twelve months = $4 800Uncovered medical bills up to this point = $10 000 Therapies uncovered by insurance  annually = $21 600 Home uncovered medical supplies and future surgery = $10 000 Clare's regular insurance  plus Ted's Medicare & supplement through Chicago Teachers’ Union = $19 200 Yearly : $143 000On top of that  insurance is trying to not pay for radiation at this point - an extra $136 000 for a standard of cancer care.  No question about it - we will be fighting this tooth and nail.I know there are some things I should not expect to be able to do with my dad again. I don’t know if we’ll be able to walk in nature together or go for a drive or visit garage sales. But the real ask here is to help us build a good life without those things. A life where Ted can breathe more easily and laugh and use his body independently  and mom can go to work knowing that my dad is receiving essential care and establish a sense of balance that will sustain her in the long-term.We are so grateful to the friends  family  and healthcare professionals that have supported us thus far. We have been held up by people’s good thoughts  meditations  and prayers  and we continue to ask for those. If you are able  a donation of any amount would be greatly appreciated by our family as Ted’s recovery continues.Here are photos of Ted in nature - which is what he loves almost as much as we love him. And in the kitchen cooking - which he does to show his love for us.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:Do you have a medical or nursing background? Sign up for shifts to watch Ted when he first comes home before we have the funds to hire someone!Do you have law experience appealing insurance denials? We would love your advice.Please email charlottebritta@gmail.com if you can help in either of these ways."

He is truly a servant who cares deeply and loves deeply – always putting others first. He has faithfully performed at benefit shows – too many to count – and gives sacrificially. However - over the years - the grind and pace of his life has taken its toll on him.  While caring for so many others he neglected himself. Many of us know Omar as the leader of the premier and award-winning Memphis reggae band Chinese Connection Dub Embassy. He is also the founder and leader of the new four-piece award-winning powerhouse hardcore punk band Negro Terror. Omar and CCDE are also Ambassadors for Musicians for Le Bonheur  which helps raise money for the children at Le Bonheur Hospital. Omar is also a church youth leader  praise team music director and college student with just one class remaining to finish his degree. He loves Memphis and everything it stands for but most of all he loves people just as much as he loves his Maker and his family.Two weeks ago - Omar was having bad flu-like symptoms and was feverish and was also having severe back pain. Being Omar  he was set on pushing on through two live shows and his three Sunday church service gigs. After the first-morning church service  Omar did not realize his body was beginning to shut down on him – he was still thinking the pain and flu-like symptoms were from a pinched nerve in his back. After getting home he laid down on the floor and literally did not get up for almost a full week - daily promising his brothers that he would be better soon. Omar was not getting better and towards the end of the week seemed to be acting strange – not like himself and not making sense when he spoke. David and Joseph had seen enough and called 911. Paramedics came to the house and took him by ambulance to the hospital. He was immediately admitted to ICU at Methodist Hospital downtown and was diagnosed with a mini-stroke and a staph infection that docs determined came from a sore on his back. On top of the infection and neurological damage - Omar has suffered kidney damage from the antibiotics and other meds. All of this trauma then caused his body to go into crisis mode and he began to retain fluids – which has put him in an incredibly dangerous and life-threatening situation. Many of you have been praying for Omar  his family and the doctors and nurses who have been doing all they can to save his life. The good news is those prayers are moving the hand of God and Omar is starting to make a turn for the better but he is still very far from being out of the woods. He is now on day 10 in the ICU at Methodist Hospital and will need to continue on the antibiotics to fight the staph infection. He will soon begin physical therapy to walk again and will soon have a complete life change needing to adhere to a strict diet which will provide improved long term health & healing. Omar – sadly like so many professional musicians in Memphis - has no health insurance. Even when he does get out of the hospital - he will continue to need meds and will be transferred to a live-in rehab facility. As I am sure you have already been thinking – his medical bills will be overwhelming! This is where we come in… please join us in helping Omar get back to doing what he loves and was born to do through his life and music - and that's to love  teach and serve so many here in Memphis. We are so blessed to have Omar in our lives as he has given so much to all of us  – now it’s our chance and our privilege to give back to him. We can do this – GO TEAM OMAR! TIME TO ROCK THIS AND ROCK IT HARD!"

Yeah... I’m not sure  either!￼The Long StoryLast January I dedicated  my 33rd year to prioritizing my health and my mind. In February I started a new job as a women's health social worker in Pittsburgh while continuing to teach yoga in the evenings. March left me with a fibromyalgia diagnosis. I began a treatment plan in April that included physical & occupational therapy  medication management  talk therapy  and weekly appointments. Prompted by my family’s medical history  I elected to undergo genetic cancer screening in June. I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer when I was 23 (2018 was the 10th anniversary of his passing)  as well as his mother and her three sisters to breast cancer before they reached the age of 45. ￼￼My screen revealed a BRCA2 gene mutation  which prompted mammogram #1 on September 15th & recall mammogram #2 on September 27th. Round two uncovered abnormal imaging and cued biopsies on each side. Sierra and I were scheduled to leave one day later for our vacation  where we would become engaged. I was advised to schedule my first biopsy for the Monday following our return. While at home recovering from that biopsy  I  was laid off from my job and informed that I would lose my health insurance at the end of that month. The pathology results came back four days later. ￼￼It's cancer. Despite all of the questions that have come up  I'm certain that I need to accept a new reality. I'll be unable to secure employment until I recover from my bilateral mastectomy  reconstruction  radiation  and possible chemotherapy. I turned 34 two days after surgery. My fertility doctor prescribed back-to-back cycles of hormone injections and egg retrievals in order to expedite the IVF process for my fiance and I. All of the above-mentioned procedures cost as much in dollars as they do time and sanity  yet are necessary in order to mitigate the side effects of treatment and give me any sort of chance at having kids in the future. This will all be in addition to the general cost of living a life  of course. Sort of like a  \"Bi*ch-I-know-cancer-is-extra\"  type of situation.￼￼I’ve always prided myself on being an independent  “I-can-do-it-myself” type of woman. It goes without saying that it’s entirely out of my comfort zone to ask for help. My new reality has shown me that this type of pride can be driven by poor self-worth and shame. In the past  I’ve sacrificed plenty of comfort zones in an effort to impact and be impacted by this big  beautiful  wild world. So  fuck it...  GOODBYE COMFORT ZONE ￼               I have cancer and I need your help. My family needs your help.  Every cent counts right now and each one means more than I can convey.

En estos momentos  se encuentra en una situación médica grave y desesperada. A finales de febrero de este año el seguro de PDVSA fue suspendido sin aviso ni consideración  por lo que Ricardo se encuentra desamparado y sin cobertura médica a pesar de ser beneficiario de este.   El día 3 de marzo del año en curso  Ricardo viajó a España a visitar a su hijo y a conocer a sus nietos de dos y un año  quienes a raíz de la diáspora venezolana se encuentran en ese país. El 5 de marzo Ricardo presentó una pérdida súbita del conocimiento y una convulsión por lo que fue llevado al hospital y al hacerle estudios se encontró una lesión en el cerebro cuyas características hicieron pensar en una metástasis.

Ricardo was part of the team that created a health insurance for all the workers in that company.

Currently he is in a serious and desperate medical situation and doesn’t have medical coverage despite being one of its beneficiaries.On March 3 of this year  Ricardo traveled to Spain to visit his son and to meet his grandchildren aged two and one year old who  as a result of the Venezuelan diaspora  live there. On March 5 Ricardo lost consciousness and had a seizure so he was taken to the hospital; after some studies  a lesion was found in the brain whose characteristics suggested a metastasis. Now we know that Ricardo has lung cancer and a brain metastasis  which was surgically removed in an emergency.At this moment Ricardo is hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Defensa Gómez Ulla in Madrid  without insurance and without any means to cover the expenses related to surgery and the treatment he needs to fight cancer. For this reason  we are asking for your help and collaboration.

Due to her specialized condition  some appointments are local  and some are a plane ride away.  As a result of her significant gross motor  fine motor and speech delays  the little amount of free time she does have looks quite different than her peers. Madeline doesn’t find enjoyment in normal activities for kids her age.  Simple things like playing with toys  working on a puzzle or even playing make believe are not possible because her brain simply doesn’t work that way….yet.  Instead of winding down each evening by learning how to properly brush her teeth  Madeline needs to be held down by one parent while the other one brushes.  This may sound like a kid who simply doesn’t behave  however that assumption couldn’t be farther from the truth.  This behavior is related to an inability of her sensory system to tolerate the feeling of a toothbrush in her mouth.  As you could imagine  Madeline’s biggest frustration is her inability to express herself in a way that other people  including her own family  can understand.  Because she has been diagnosed with both Autism and apraxia  a motor planning disorder  verbal communication is extremely difficult.   Despite all of this  Madeline remains to be a positive and extremely happy little girl.  Due to her amazing strength  she relentlessly pushes herself every day in the hope to make her current world a distant memory.      By the age of three  Madeline was attending 32 hours of therapy sessions per week in addition to her 10 hours of preschool.  She has undergone multiple surgeries and has been diagnosed with several disorders / conditions explaining her developmental delays.  Her primary diagnosis is Autism.  Given Madeline’s therapy schedule and treatment plan  putting my career on hold became a must.  As her mom  I wanted to be there every step of the way and provide every single opportunity for her to reach her full potential.     Despite our steadfast commitment to her physical and cognitive development  her progress has been slow.  We are tirelessly looking for opportunities to give Madeline the best chance at a normal life.  Our search has led us to Stem Cell Therapy  which involves using stem cells harvested from the cord and placentas of healthy born babies.   After reading multiple clinical studies from high profile universities like Duke  along with talking to numerous doctors and parents in similar situations  many of our hopes for Madeline seem very possible using Stem Cell treatments.  We are very optimistic that with multiple rounds of treatments  along with continued intense therapy  we will see the efforts of Madeline’s hard work start to pay off. Unfortunately  Stem Cell Therapy comes at a significant cost  which is currently not offset by health insurance.  Having already spent tens of thousands of dollars on continuous therapies and visits to her doctors  we find ourselves in a financial situation where the funds for stem cell treatment simply aren’t there. One Stem Cell Treatment  along with the required intensive therapy  comes at a cost of $12 000.  Based on discussions with families currently utilizing stem cells  we know that one round of treatment will not result in a cure or even provide Madeline with the maximum benefits.  Our goal is simple; to give Madeline the very best shot at one day having normal life where she can be a contributing member of society and have lasting friendships. To have any chance of realizing this dream  she will have to undergo multiple treatments.     Throughout this journey we have heard stories about hundreds of incredibly kind and generous people who have been instrumental in assisting with the treatment of many children with the same challenges as our little girl.  It is because of these stories that we made this humbling decision to ask for help as well.  This is a moment that each parent has experienced.  A moment to swallow your pride and ask for the help you need to give your child an opportunity to be the best person he or she could be.  It is with this spirit that we ask for your help in raising the funds required for Madeline to receive this Stem Cell Therapy. Our goal is to raise $60 000 to provide a minimum of five rounds of treatment for Madeline.  We know it is going to require an incredible amount of donations to make this goal a reality.  We hope you will consider even a small donation as every dollar makes a difference.  Please know that all support is incredibly appreciated.  Lastly  we hope you will consider sharing our little girl’s story with your network as well.  Only by sharing Madeline’s story will we be able to make this type of grass roots effort a success.  Thank you for taking the time to read about Madeline’s journey.  In addition  thank you for any support that you can offer in our time of need."

He has lived a life of service to others by volunteering to numerous religious and non-for-profit organizations. Even with all his activities and busy schedule Jose always finds time to let his friends know that he cares about them  it can be thru a phone call  a text or a quick little visit just to say “Hello”.  Jose is never too busy to lend a helping hand to one that needs it  even if he himself is in need of help. He is selfless  service minded  oozes with happiness  has a strong faith in God  he is committed and extremely responsible. Jose is just a superb human being.WHAT HAPPENED?Unfortunately  even the nicest of people have bad things happen to them.  On the evening of January 15  2019 Jose was not feeling at this best  he was weak and disoriented and felt as if he was going to pass out.  He had just enough energy to call a friend and ask him to please take him to the hospital. They barely made it and he had to be wheeled in as he was rapidly losing consciousness. After treating him and running a series of in-depth testing the test results came back positive for colon cancer.  The tests also revealed several dark spots on his liver which confirmed that the cancer had metastasized; He was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.SECOND OPINIONHe immediately looked for a second opinion at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America  in Zion IL. hoping it was all a big mix-up and he did not have a such a serious illness. He was admitted to the Center on Wednesday  January 23  2019 for an intense 3 day evaluation. The Center ran additional tests and confirmed the original diagnosis  he had stage 4 colon cancer.  At this point time was of the essence and both Jose and his doctors decided that the best thing for Jose was to start with his treatment as soon as possible. The chemo sessions were scheduled to last for a period of three months and at the end of the three months another evaluation would take place and dictate the next steps. Unfortunately  Jose had some complications over the weekend which resulted in Jose having to have an emergency surgery to extract the cancerous tumor  chemotherapy was now postponed after full recovery.COMPLICATIONSThe recovery from the surgery was supposed to be uneventful  he was to be released in a couple of days and go home to recover for 4 to 6 weeks. Sadly  that was not the case; a couple of days after the surgery Jose was told that he was retaining fluids and he needed to stay in observation just to be safe.  As his luck will have it  a second emergency surgery needed to be performed  he had developed an acute infection in his stomach. This was a major set back on his recovery  now Jose has to recover from two different surgeries. Even with all the complications Jose always keeps a positive attitude and thanks God for giving him one more day to live. Once he recovers from the two surgeries  the doctors will be able to re-evaluate him and decide when he is ready to start chemotherapy to treat the spots found on his liver and to prevent any further spread of the cancerous cells.URGENT NEEDIt’s been over a month since Jose stopped working and bills started to pile up including rent  utilities and all the medical expenses that the health insurance in not covering. This GoFundMe page was created to help Jose alleviate some of that burden so he can fully concentrate only on his health  and get back to being the person we all know and love. Any contribution big or small will make a difference to help lessen the financial stress for him and his family. This is the beginning of a long road ahead and all the funds contributed will help him directly now and through his recovery.YOU CAN HELP!It is heartbreaking to see Jose in such delicate state. There are moments of agony and yet even in the middle of the despair Jose is not giving up  he is truly fighting for his life.  Even the greatest warriors need a guiding light  perhaps together we can be a little ray of sunshine for Jose in the middle of this massive storm.

Después de tratarlo y realizar una serie de pruebas a profundidad  los resultados de la prueba dieron positivo de cáncer de colon. Las pruebas también revelaron varias manchas oscuras en su hígado que confirmaron que el cáncer había hecho metástasis; Fue diagnosticado con cáncer de colon en etapa 4.SEGUNDA OPINIONInmediatamente buscó una segunda opinión en los Centros de Tratamiento del Cáncer de América  en Zion IL. esperando que todo fuera una gran confusión y que no tuviera una enfermedad tan grave. Fue admitido en el Centro el miércoles 23 de enero de 2019 para una evaluación intensa de 3 días. El Centro realizó pruebas adicionales y confirmó el diagnóstico original  tenía cáncer de colon en etapa 4. En este punto  el tiempo era esencial y tanto José como sus médicos decidieron que lo mejor para José era comenzar con su tratamiento lo antes posible. Las sesiones de quimioterapia estaban programadas para durar un período de tres meses y al final de los tres meses se llevaría a cabo una evaluación de los siguientes pasos. Desafortunadamente  José tuvo algunas complicaciones durante ese fin de semana  lo que provocó que José tuviera que someterse a una cirugía de emergencia para extraer el tumor canceroso; la quimioterapia se pospuso para después de la recuperació de la cirugía.COMPLICACIONESSe suponía que la recuperación de la cirugía pasaría sin incidentes  se daría de alta en un par de días y se iría a casa para recuperarse durante 4 a 6 semanas. Lamentablemente  ese no fue el caso; Un par de días después de la cirugía  se le dijo a José que estaba reteniendo líquidos y que necesitaba permanecer en observación para asegurarse que todo marchara bien. No fue su suerte  se necesitó una segunda cirugía de emergencia ya que se había desarrollado una infección aguda en el estómago. Este fue un gran retroceso en su recuperación  ahora José tiene que recuperarse de dos cirugías diferentes.Incluso con todas las complicaciones  José siempre mantiene una actitud positiva y agradece a Dios por darle un día más para vivir. Una vez que se recupere de las dos cirugías  los médicos podrán evaluarlo y decidir cuándo está listo para comenzar la quimioterapia para tratar el cáncer que se encuentran en su hígado y prevenir una mayor propagación de las células cancerosas.NECESIDAD URGENTEHa pasado más de un mes desde que José dejó de trabajar y las facturas comenzaron a acumularse  incluyendo la renta  las utilidades  y todos los gastos médicos que el seguro de salud no cubre. Esta página de GoFundMe se creó para ayudar a José a aliviar algo de esa carga para que pueda concentrarse completamente en su salud y volver a ser la persona que todos conocemos y queremos. Cualquier contribución grande o pequeña hará una diferencia para ayudar a disminuir el estrés financiero para él y su familia. Este es el comienzo de un largo camino por delante y todos los fondos aportados lo ayudarán directamente ahora y durante su recuperación.¡TU PUEDES AYUDAR!Es desgarrador ver a José en tan delicado estado. Hay momentos de agonía y  sin embargo  incluso en medio de la desesperación  José no se da por vencido  está luchando por su vida. Incluso los guerreros más grandes necesitan una luz de guía  quizás juntos podamos ser un pequeño rayo de sol para José en medio de esta tormenta masiva. Cuando contribuyas  por favor piensa en la bondad y el amoroso corazón de José por los demás.Gracias por su generosidad y que muchas bendiciones vengan en su camino."

Long story short  by age 12 the disease clogged her liver so badly that she needed a liver transplant. It took 8 months before hers arrived.  Her last 10 days of waiting were spent in the ICU on life support.  She was 2 days away from the medical team having to pose the question “When do we pull the plug?”When she woke from the surgeries she could not talk  she could not walk  and she barely had any control of any motor functions.  She could not even hold her head up on her own.  She was like a preteen zombie  and would have to relearn all of those things.  We DID know  that inside that brain of hers  she was all there (she proved that to us)  she just could not get her body to do the things that come naturally to us all.  ALL the doctors were flabbergasted.  They did not expect any of this.  There was no script for what was happening  and how to deal with it  or what the outcome would be.After 30 days in the ICU (at $125 000 per day)  she moved to a regular ward in the hospital  and the hard work began.  It would be another month before she was out.  It would be another 3 months before she was in the clear.  As in the clear as could be at the time.Fast forward Here’s the thing.  I had ALL of that pretty much covered!  I had diligently worked with the hospitals accounting team  and all of the insurance companies involved to get nearly all of those costs covered.  The premiums were costly  as well as the missed work  but if that is all we had to deal with  well  that was manageable.  They had given us the script of how this would go and we followed it.  I didn't do any fund raisers at the time  because we didn't NEED them at the time.But  things didn't go according to script.  Yay  you have a new healthy liver.  Go home and have a great life!  But that’s not how it went. The physical cost in saving that body was greater than any book they had.  Twenty one IV lines streaming life saving medication  and actively dying for an extended period of time came at a great cost to her body.  That cost for her is joint deteriorating osteoarthritis  and the bone density of an 80 year old woman.  At the age of 17 she had a full hip replacement surgery.  The ball joint looked like a piece of cauliflower.  Just recently  she broke the second toe on her right foot.  How?  By running in gym class. How she was walking just before the hip replacement a year ago.The financial costPremiums for health insurance when you work for a small company are huge.  There aren't choices.  You get the plan they pick  and that is all.  These plans come with astronomical deductibles and out of pocket expenses.  All told  you could buy a brand new car EVERY.SINGLE.YEAR.  This does not even include the things insurance does NOT cover  or all the missed time from work for appointments.I’m that guy.  I’m the guy who makes a middle to upper middle class income  and can’t afford the insurance costs that my daughter so desperately needs.  I live in a modest 2 000 sq ft. ranch home with a mortgage payment less than what many families pay in rent.   I drive a 2003 Toyota Corolla with 235 000 miles on it.  I don’t have the latest anything.  I don’t go on vacations.  All of my furnishings are hand-me-downs.  98% of my clothes are 10 years old or older.  My retirement savings is gone.I’m a 53 year old divorced single father of 3 wonderful and amazing children who I cherish every day  and I am in debt up to my eyeballs because of medical related expenses  and my current employment will be ending soon.  In just 2 years I went from being just a little behind of where one my age probably “should” be financially  to asking “what the hell happened?” To be clear: Our medical bills are almost all paid.  However  to do this  I have had to incur other debt to satisfy those bills.As the dad  you’re supposed to handle this.  You are supposed to be the rock that they can count on.  I’m the person who is the giver  not the asker.  This is an incredibly humbling request I make now.I know that this is no small task  but we have faced “no small task” a few times now and prevailed.  Your generous gift will have the honor of lifting this financial burden that no one in the richest country in the world should ever have to face.  A burden I have been bearing and hiding all too long.I cannot thank you all enough for all the support!  With Love and Peace to all. ~ Rick"

Well the man happened to be our classmate and friend Keith Oakes  Class of ‘74  from Bethlehem Central. Keith  aka “Oakie” was a friend to many of us. Most of us have not seen nor heard from him in a very long time. https://wnyt.com/news/boy-helps-stranger-in-wheelchair-get-home-during-snowstorm-josh-cuzdey-colonie-albany-county/5147944/ He has had some hard times recently  which we think require some action on our part. He was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer. He was operated on last year  and during his recovery  he developed a blood clot in his leg which required amputation to save his life. You might remember Keith as a superb athlete who played Varsity Baseball and Basketball. He made it look easy. I recently took Keith out to breakfast  and although his current living arrangements are not the most desirable  he was upbeat and pretty nimble.Hard times can fall upon any of us. Keith is trying to move forward with these recent setbacks  but additionally his new wheelchair was stolen. He is currently using a second hand chair that does not meet his needs. He is also currently homeless and is awaiting possible placement in a social services apartment that is wheelchair accessible. These apartments don’t grow on trees at social services reimbursement rates. I will be meeting with his caseworker very soon to see what Keith’s options are. In the meantime  let’s do something now do it quickly  but do it right. We are not looking to put Keith up in the Ritz Carlton for the rest of his life. We are looking to help him secure a proper wheelchair  and an apartment that is safe  secure and  foremost  meets his adaptive needs. Eventually  Keith will be getting a prosthetic leg that should be fully covered under his insurance  but it might not cover possible additional fitting needs.We are proposing a “Go Fund Me” account that will be administered by myself (Jon Maskin) and fellow friends and classmates Terry Tipple and Bob Rooney. We will ensure all donations go for Keith’s welfare. Our hope is to help with rental needs that exceed Social Security benefits  and assist with his local transportation needs  and of course provide updates to wheel chair and other adaptive equipment he might need that exceeds his SSI and health insurance.Below is the Go Fund Me information  along with the video seen locally on both channels 10 and 13 in Albany. Please pass this on to all relevant people you might feel that can help. I will provide updates on Social Media. Facebook etc. My email is Adkjonny@gmail.com if you have any questions. We wish you Happy Holidays! And let’s try to make Keith’s one that he will remember. We will call ourselves the “Oakes Tree”Peace to you all. Our best  Jon  Bob and Terry"

I know him as my partner  roommate  cat co-parent  and best friend.After work on July 27th  Ryan left home for a motorcycle ride. Less than 10 minutes in  he was hit by a car and taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for emergency surgery. Ryan was conscious for the entire accident. He remembers being hit  flying through the air  landing on the grass on the opposite side of the street  and looking down to see his crushed foot and ankle.Within a week of his accident  he had to make the difficult decision to amputate his left leg below the knee over the other option  which was to suffer through a life of chronic pain with the inability to walk. Ryan chose the option that allows him to get back to playing in his band  work jobs that require mobility  and who knows  maybe run again someday. On August 2nd  he had his third and final surgery to amputate his left leg. Since being released after a second week in the hospital  he has been regaining his strength and just recently started to learn how to walk with his first prosthetic leg.Ryan's doctors have told him that as an amputee  he will need a new prosthetic leg every year for the next several years  and every one to three years after that. If he wants to run or pursue another more demanding activity  he will need additional prosthetics. These cost between $25 000 and $50 000 each and health insurance will only cover or partially cover what they deem \"medically necessary.\"Those of you who know Ryan know that he moves through the world in his own very special way. He dances into the room  high kicks to celebrate small wins  and (in my opinion) has the best dance moves out of everyone in his band. Ryan has a hard time asking for help  so I'm asking on his behalf so he can get back to having the jump in his step that he's always had.

Your contribution and support for Kali during this difficult time is deeply appreciated. On December 27th Kali was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. This completely changed her life. In order to focus on what has become the biggest challenge she has ever faced  she is taking time off from work and essentially putting her life on hold. Coming to terms with breast cancer at the age of 32 is challenging to say the least. Minnesota has a great health care system  and Kali is confident in her treatment plan. She enrolled in an immunotherapy clinical study  which has given her access to cutting edge treatments and further testing. These tests include MRIs  CTs  and PET scans. The results from the first set of scans confirmed that the cancer is stage 2b. While still an aggressive form of cancer  it thankfully has not spread to any other areas of her body.Kali had her first chemotherapy infusion on January 28th  and these treatments will continue for 22 weeks. Following chemo  she will have surgery in August to remove the tumor and breast tissue. This surgery will likely be a full or partial mastectomy to reduce any chance of recurrence. There will be a recovery period after surgery  which may be followed by radiation therapy depending on further test results. Hormonal treatment is the last step and will continue for an undetermined length of time. Kali is fortunate to have health insurance to help pay for most of the medical costs associated with treatment; however  her monthly health insurance costs have increased. She has medical and pharmaceutical deductibles to pay  and other parts of this process that are not covered by insurance. These include fertility treatments  genetic counseling  and unforeseen additional costs. As there was no immediate family history of breast cancer until now  genetic counseling is especially important. It will help doctors determine which surgery will be most appropriate  and provide invaluable information to the other women in Kali’s family. Facing these financial burdens while battling cancer feels overwhelming. The money from this fund will provide financial relief in a challenging time. Kali’s friends can attest: Kali is one of the most caring  adventurous  supportive  and wise people you’ll ever meet. We have no doubt she’ll win this battle  but your help would mean a lot as she navigates this challenge. She can’t wait to return to happier times of hiking  traveling  and spending quality time with her friends and family. Any donation amount helps. Kali is so grateful for all the amazing people in her life. Thank you all  and we love you!2/13/19 Edit: Gofundme asked for further details. This gofundme was written by Kali’s friends and her husband  Sean Campbell  who posted this page. Kali and Sean live in St. Paul  Minnesota  about an hour north of where Kali grew up in Rochester. Kali studied abroad in Australia in 2008  where she met Sean  and moved there after she finished college. They were married in 2011. After spending 6 years in Australia (where Sean is from) they moved to Minnesota in July  2016. Funds raised from this will be used as stated above: for insurance deductibles  genetic testing  fertility treatments  and to have funds available for unforeseen medical costs. These funds will be directly deposited into a joint bank account between Kali and Sean  where it will be accessed for Kali's medical bills.Thanks to all the people who have donated so far  it’s unbelievably generous  and a huge relief to not have to worry excessively over money during a time full of enough challenges. We are overwhelmed by the support  and grateful for all the ways you have shown support so far."

Everything changed almost overnight. She was forced to leave her job due to her health and new restrictions. Her condition was managed with chemo all winter and in May she underwent a bone marrow transplant at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. Since that time  mom has been putting one foot in front of the other on this journey that is recovery.Despite suddenly being out of work and the myriad costs associated with multiple trips back and forth to Boston  mom has managed to find a way to make ends meet. Much of this is due to help from friends and family. Mom has been hesitant to start a GoFundMe site because she felt strongly she did not want to ask for help or \"handouts\" as long as she could find creative ways to finance this journey on her own. Unfortunately  at this point  this is no longer a realistic option.A few weeks ago mom's leukemia cells reappeared  and last Monday she was readmitted to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston with fevers of unknown origin. She has been here since  undergoing numerous procedures  with no discharge date determined as of yet. Once the medical team makes a plan (which we have total faith they will do)  and discharge mom to go home  we know that this rollercoaster ride will continue and she will likely have even more frequent trips to Boston for check-ups and treatment.We understand that for many  there isn't much extra to go around and that folks have struggles of their own that they are facing. Our ask is that if you are in a position  our family would be incredibly grateful if you would consider donating to help defray some of mom’s costs. No amount is too small  and any and all donations would be greatly appreciated.All funds raised will be put towards; gas for the trips to Boston  special food and groceries for mom's diet  medical co-pays/bills  prescription costs  medical supplies for the home (not covered by insurance)  severely increased monthly health insurance premiums and other costs which directly result from mom's leukemia and treatment. In addition  as we approach winter in New England  it is highly likely that mom may occasionally need to find lodging near Boston if a snowstorm should prevent a return trip home after an appointment.It is difficult enough to face a life-threatening illness like AML  but is made all the more daunting when you're also exerting energy worrying about bills  logistics  and how to continue to finance your journey forward. Particularly when you don't know how long that journey may take.For those who want to read more about mom's journey please feel free to follow along on our Caring Bridge website:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/carolineclifton.Thank you to all who have reached out over the last few months  sent messages of support and love  sent gas or grocery gift cards  done errands  offered a ride  an ear  a shoulder. Mom would not have gotten this far without the support of incredible friends and family that we are so very fortunate and appreciative to have.One of the reasons we started this site is that so many of you amazing people have been asking \"what can I do to help?\" and  unfortunately  as a function of mom's condition  there just aren't many tangible options. She can't have flowers  she can't have food prepared by anyone outside the home and visitors are severely restricted. This is one way to help which would go directly towards alleviating unnecessary anxiety for mom  and for our family.  We understand that so many face struggles of their own  and would never want anyone to donate if it would negatively impact them or their family. That said  if you are in a position to  our family would be incredibly grateful if you'd please consider donating any amount you could comfortably spare - truly  no amount is too small! If you are unable to donate  words of encouragement  positive thoughts  and prayers are always enormously appreciated and gratefully received.Please feel free to share and thank you all in advance for considering donating.

"Medical","November 4, 2018","Saving Simon","$17,258","$30,000","248","5","247","1.2k","AUSTIN","TX","Simon’s Diagnosis and Prognosis: Our sweet  little miracle boy (chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer left mommy nearly infertile)  Simon Alexander Croke  was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Sanfilippo Syndrome (also known as MPS III) on October 17  2018 at 29 months of age. It is a progressive and fatal disease affecting 1 in 70 000 children. We are devastated and heartbroken... MPS III is commonly referred to as Alzheimer's for children. Unfortunately  Simon was born with a change in his DNA that causes a critical enzyme to be made improperly (or not at all). Because he doesn’t have enough of this enzyme  he cannot breakdown and recycle natural cellular waste. Thus  Simon’s cells become clogged with toxic levels of heparan sulfate. While every cell in his body is affected  his brain cells suffer the most. The effects  of which  have already become apparent: speech problems  developmental delays  and mild-moderate hearing loss.  There is currently no cure for Sanfilippo  but we remain hopeful that Simon will qualify and be selected for a clinical trial offering gene therapy  which has been showing some positive results. Without intervention  Simon and other children with MPS III will go on to experience progressive cognitive decline; lose the ability to speak  walk  and eat; and eventually die in their teenage years. This genetic disorder is relentless and devastating. At this time  only supportive or “palliative” care is available. Life expectancy is typically around 15 years  at best. For children living with Sanfilippo today  participation in a clinical trial is their only opportunity to try a treatment. Unfortunately  these trials only accept an extremely small number of patients  and time is not something these children have on their side. Medical research has recently yielded some promising results with real hopes for the future  but there is still much unknown and no therapies  to date  have been approved by the FDA for treatment. Call-to-Action: As one can imagine  despite having health insurance  the amount of financial resources  time  and energy spent on therapy  medical bills  and child care has already taken a toll  and we are just in the beginning stages of this battle to save our Simon. Please consider making a donation through GoFundMe to fund Simon’s medical bills and related expenses. If you prefer to make a tax-deductible donation  please choose this 501c3  non-profit Cure Sanfilippo Foundation (Tax ID: 46-4322131)  and make the gift in honor of \"Simon Croke\":  https://curesff.org/donate/ (or by check to - Cure Sanfilippo Foundation  PO Box 6901  Columbia  SC 29260). This organization advocates for and funds research directed toward a cure or treatment options for Simon and other children with Sanfilippo Syndrome. Time is of the essence! Please help us improve the quality of  and extend  our little boy’s life. Please share this GoFundMe page on your social media outlets or with friends and family. We are counting on compassionate people like you to embrace our story and hope  and take action by telling others about Sanfilippo Syndrome. Awareness leads to contributions. We appreciate each and every one of them. For more information about Sanfilippo Syndrome  please click on this link:  https://curesff.org/ More About Simon’s Journey: At first  we suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder before discovering this underlying diagnosis. We approached Simon’s pediatrician at 13 months of age because he wasn’t responding to his name or hitting his developmental milestones  and had developed repetitive play (i.e. spinning of toys). This lead to consulting with a pediatric neurologist who ordered a medley of tests. The results of all were thankfully normal  but left us without answers. In order to help Simon with his challenges  he began receiving physical  occupational  and speech therapies at 15 months of age. Alina (mommy) also ramped up teaching Simon how to use sign language since he was nonverbal at this point. After six months of intensive therapies  his pediatric developmental specialist assessed Simon as having only developed three months of skill. He had the skill level of a baby half of his age. This news destroyed us. We and the therapists had been working continuously to close Simon’s gaps in development. It's almost as if he was unable to progress any faster  but no healthcare professional  at that point  could provide a reason. Despite Simon’s delays and our feelings that something wasn’t quite right  we continued to focus on the positives: He was slowly making progress and achieving goals; Simon slept and ate well; and he affectionately connected with us through hugs  smiles  and laughter. As Simon’s medical therapies continued  we pursued additional help for Simon. At 21 months of age  he began seeing a movement therapist to help him with his gross motor skills  craniosacral therapist to help him with his ability to speak  and chiropractor to adjust a newly discovered head and neck bone jam. Simon began to move in ways that he wasn’t able to in infancy! It was beautiful to watch. We thought that we had possibly discovered the cause of his problems. But  we continued to pursue other possibilities as well.  At the recommendation of Simon’s pediatric developmental specialist  he underwent an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test at 25 months of age. This revealed that Simon had mild-moderate hearing loss. We were shocked and confused because he had passed his newborn hearing screen. Simon now wears hearing aids  and his language and expressive language skills have begun to blossom. We thought that we had possibly discovered a secondary cause of his problems. But  we had one last possibility to investigate. At 28 months  we consulted with a pediatric geneticist (after sitting on the appointment calendar for six months). She predicted that he had a metabolic storage disorder  and ordered a full body x-ray  abdominal ultrasound  and urine test. After two long weeks of waiting for the results  we were crushed by the news of Simon’s new Sanfilippo Syndrome diagnosis. The urine test revealed the presence of elevated concentrations of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)  which meant that Simon could not break them down. They had been accumulating in his body tissue  and he had been abnormally excreting them in his urine. These accumulated molecules have been causing Simon’s cellular machinery to work improperly. Once enough of the toxic GAGs build up  his brain cells die and vital brain tissue is lost leaving him with permanent brain damage."

Although Lynn has always been a beacon of light to her family  friends   and community she has recently had a stroke of bad health. Lynn has large blood clots in both her legs  which has been preventing blood flow to her feet. She is scheduled to have two separate surgeries to remove the blood clots  in an attempt to save her feet from being amputated. Due to her current condition she has been out of work for over two weeks  and it is not clear when she will be able to return. Unfourntly  Lynn does not have the luxury of being able to afford health insurance  so all of her medical bills will need to be paid in full. We are asking that people reach into their heart and give what they can to help Lynn pay for her medical bills and modifications to her home. Any amount will help and is greatly appreciated. Thank you and have a blessed day."

Patty  his partner of 37 years  managed to get him to the ER at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas.  There  the doctors assessed that Sammy's kidneys had shut down and began emergency dialysis. It has been a scary past week and a half  but Sammy is feeling a lot better now  and can't wait to get out of the hospital!For the next few weeks and possibly months  Sammy is going to need dialysis treatments three times a week to clean toxins from his blood until his kidneys start working better again. And he'll need to be monitored closely by a kidney doctor as well as his primary care physician and a cardiologist. All of this care is critical to Sammy's health and a big life change. It's also very expensive. Currently Sammy doesn't have health insurance and so that makes this challenging situation a lot scarier. Insurance hasn't been affordable for Sammy recently (more than $600 per month)  so he's been paying out of pocket for his doctor visits  lab work  and prescriptions. Now that he'll need dialysis three days a week  though  his medical care is going to be much more expensive. Plus there's a big hospital bill on the horizon. We're reaching out to some programs that offer financial assistance in hopes that there might be a grant available to help pay for dialysis. Sammy's not eligible for Medicaid right now  but may be able to apply for it in February. In the meantime  Sammy is in a gap where there's no insurance and not enough cash on hand to cover the costs. If you know Sammy  you know he is a great guy. He's caring and funny. He'd give you the shirt off his back. He's made his motorcycle shop into a warm center for the dirt bike community  adding movie screenings in his shop's parking lot. He takes care of everyone. He's the most loving brother a sister could ask for. He's never asked for help and doesn't want to ask for help. But he really needs some help right now and so we - his sister Maria and his partner Patty - are asking on his behalf. Friends and family have mentioned putting together a GoFundMe page so that they can chip in. We would be so grateful if you could help us out and donate if you can and spread the word. The funds will go to:- Paying the bill from Sammy's hospital stay - currently $21 000 and counting- Paying for Sammy's dialysis treatments until he has Medicaid - $1 500 per week- Paying for Sammy's doctor visits and lab work- Paying for Sammy's prescriptions We want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for reading this message and for any help you're able to send Sammy's way. He's given so much to us and we want to make sure he's taken care of. We love him to the moon and back. Love Maria (Sam's sister) & Patty (Sam's partner)"

I'm Laura Cohen  Alex's mom  and I've started this fundraiser for Alex with the help of his fiancee  Evie Sirianni  his father  Marty Cohen  and his stepmother  Janet Krews. We are the ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER TEAM! I live in Gainesville  where Alex is undergoing treatment at Shands Cancer Center  and am one of Alex's caretakers as he goes through this health crisis. The physical and emotional costs of a cancer diagnosis are well known  but the financial burden is equally tough. Even with health insurance  the costs associated with the intensive treatment Alex requires to beat cancer are astronomical  especially since he has been mostly unable to work. All donations will go directly to unpaid medical bills  as well as living expenses while Alex is out of work. We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support as we help Alex on his way to a cancer-free life!THE BAD: Alex \"Coach\" Cohen was diagnosed in February with testicular cancer that has spread to his lungs and abdomen and is facing the fight of his life. Alex underwent surgery to remove his left testicle in February and was hospitalized a few weeks later to have another procedure to insert a nephrostomy tube in his left kidney  which was not functioning due to the presence of a massive tumor in his abdomen.  Last week Alex began an aggressive 12-week chemotherapy treatment  to be followed by an RPLND surgery sometime in July to remove any tumors left in his abdomen and lymph nodes. As a result of these treatments  Alex has been unable to work and will soon use up his allotted sick time.Meanwhile Alex and his fiancee  Evie  had been saving to pay for their wedding next year  and for a down payment on their first house. While he does have health insurance through his job as a high school teacher and football coach  there are numerous medical and living expenses not covered during this time. To help care for Alex while he undergoes the finest treatment available at Shands Cancer Center  Evie had to quit her job and move to Gainesville. Consequently  their savings has practically vanished.THE GOOD:As a high school teacher and football coach for the past nine years  Alex has relished the opportunity to assist dozens of students and players overcome major obstacles in their lives. And now he faces this personal battle and he NEEDS YOUR HELP.You can participate in helping Coach Cohen overcome the biggest challenge of his life – the villain cancer. The ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER Team is actively raising money to help offset his medical bills and living expenses during the rigorous four-month chemotherapy regimen and potential surgery this summer. And unfortunately cancer simply doesn’t go away – Alex will need to be monitored closely for at least the next five years for the possibility of a recurrence and more costly medical expenses.  So please help us in any way you can as The ALEX WILL BEAT CANCER Team continues to work endlessly for Alex and his future wife Evie. We Believe That We Will Win!"

Sophia was seven at the time. We were at the dinner table when he collapsed. I thought that nothing could be more difficult than grieving his loss and instantly becoming the sole breadwinner for us. Sophia and I eventually healed and have managed to keep a delicate balance financially  through the recession  until this year and my diagnosis.When I told Sophia that I found a lump in my breast  I took her hand and helped her to feel it.  She cried. One of her first thoughts was about what would happen to her if we had a bad outcome (at that time we didn’t know the diagnosis.)   She said  ‘Does this mean I’ll become an orphan?’   Which in thinking about it was a totally understandable response from a teenager who has already lost her father.   I especially don’t want the impact of my cancer to derail her grades since she heads to college in only two years.   YIKES! She’s a good student and a great daughter.   I’m doing the best that I can for her.   I feel like I’m treading hard to keep our heads above water and under normal circumstances  I’m very self-sufficient  but with this diagnosis I need help. I’ve been self-employed for many years and am also a temporary-part time employee for a local community college.   Sophia and I don’t have benefits like health insurance and traditional sick  vacation and other supportive resources.   We have high deductibles  high out of pocket limits and a 20% copay for everything.   We were already operating on a very thin financial margin when I was diagnosed.   So  this health setback has been financially devastating  and the bills continue to amass frighteningly.  Preparing this message to share with others has been a challenge because it’s hard for me to ask for help.   My friends have had to remind me that it’s not JUST about me  it’s about my daughter too.   So  I’m asking for support from friends  family and strangers. I wish things were different but wishing hasn’t made the challenges go away.   Normally  I would just do more to resolve the financial situation  but with ‘health’ at some point the notion of taking on more becomes self-limiting. I’ve managed to remove the ‘killer breast’ and face a year of chemo/drug therapy to assure that I have a strong chance of survival.   I hope you might find it in your heart to help me. I promise I’ll continue to be who I am…. a giver  a person who serves and to be the best MOM I can be.   Please keep us in your prayers and know that I am eternally grateful for any amount you can donate to help us out.  God bless you."

As a result  it was advised that Kyoung-Ah begin further treatments. To date she has received five infusions. A recent scan shows the condition is worsening (perhaps temporarily) and we do not know how long the treatment will need to continue   but we’re hoping the treatment is working.Many of you have asked how you can help   so we have created this site as a way to help us all contribute to her healing journey and encircle her with our collective support.As you might suspect. the practical and financial concerns that accompany a serious illness are many. Kyoung-Ah’s health insurance requires numerous copays and is finicky about the treatment options it will pay for. A lot of oncology related treatment (e.g. acupuncture  water/land physical therapy  pain management  etc.) which aid in managing the pain and side effects of chemo and radiation  are not covered. In addition her medical leave at work is quickly evaporating  and her treatment plan will extend far beyond the time that this ends.A further practical concern is managing day to day living tasks.  Kyoung-Ah's mother   who is currently visiting from Korea  is not able to stay for the whole duration of  treatment. Routine tasks such as housecleaning and grocery shopping are not possible now given Kyoung-Ah’s compromised immune system. A way we can help is to fund a care assistant  cleaning services  and transportation to appointments.  Also since doctors have advised a strictly organic diet  funds can go toward purchases at places like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.Emotional support is also important and people have asked about gifts such as flowers  plants or candles.  These are such thoughtful ideas but we want to pass along a recommendation from the American Cancer Society that these type of items are not a good fit for patients with weakened immune systems. Gifts that are encouraged include organic unscented products  such as  lip balms  shea butter  coconut oil and lavender products which help with insomnia.  Also suggested are things that can make her laugh. Laughter is one of life's simple and powerful gifts proven to encourage healing.Our goal for this funding site is to make it easy for all of us to help and for our dear friend to get what she needs when she needs it.  We want her to be able to focus her energy on her health and not on the details of managing her illness.We thank you for being a part of her healing community and hope this opens up a direct way for you to take action to support our friend.  Within the bounds of our respect for her privacy  we will keep you posted on her journey and on any changing needs.With much love  respect and gratitude!"

Thankfully  after four days in the ICU  she's out of immediate danger  but her recovery is expected to be quite long. Returning to work will be even longer. I wish you could know Connor and Adrienne like I know them. Connor and Adrienne are everywhere in our community. Connor does well in school and sports  has been working at the Queen Anne Community Center and other part time jobs for years  yet somehow will always make time to help with someone's garden or to build a deck. He makes friendships with people of all ages and once you are his friend he will always be there for you  always checking in on you. His fabulous mom Adrienne has a million dollar smile and her home and heart are always open to all of Connor's friends and teammates. She's been raising Connor singlehanded for ten years  as Connor's father is not present in their lives. They have always taken care of others and they have always taken care of each other. But now they are facing a crisis where our community needs to help take care of them. They have limited health insurance and know that many of their expenses will not be covered. They expect their share of the first medical portion alone to exceed $10 000. We would like to set a goal of $10 000 to cover their living expenses and out of pocket medical expenses for the next couple of months. All proceeds will go to their necessities and medical expenses. This is a parent's worst nightmare  to be unable to work and support her child. All Adrienne should be focusing on right now is her recovery. All Connor should be doing now is studying for his finals  working his part-time jobs  being with his friends  and looking forward to Christmas. Instead  he's spent the last four days in the hospital helping his mom and worrying about how they'll pay for utilities  food  and whether they can even afford this month's rent.100% of your donation will go to keeping them afloat until everything returns to normal. Whether your donation is big or small  it will truly mean the world to them. We will update the gofundme site with further information about Adrienne's health as it becomes available.

It was a break-out year for her in so many ways  and now she could really benefit from our help as her huge momentum has been interrupted. On Christmas Eve  Kaitlyn was leaving Driggs  Idaho in her truck and collided with an oncoming vehicle on icy roads. She was incredibly lucky to survive the impact  but it left her seriously injured. That night  she had surgery to repair a torn bladder  and a few days later  another team of surgeons stabilized four fractures in her pelvis and one in her sacrum. She also has a broken fibula. The surgeries went well; she now has several external rods holding her pelvis together as it heals  but she won't be able to put weight on her legs for ten weeks as the bones heal. Her spirit has remained amazingly positive  her big smile still spreads across her face frequently  and now she's putting the same level of focus into her recovery that has helped her become such a dominant force on the bike. Kaitlyn already has begun extensive physical therapy  and that will continue for the next few months as she works to maintain and then regain strength and mobility. She'll then re-learn how to walk and eventually pedal a bike. It's going to be a slow process  but she's already surprising her care team - she managed to get out of her bed and into a chair just one day after her last surgery!She's also now dealing with the realities of the next few months  and this is where we all can potentially help out through the Kaitlyn Boyle Recovery Fund. She was slated to be working in the field for NOLS and Prescott College for the next two months  but she's now forced to forgo that income. Her health insurance will help substantially until she leaves the hospital  but then she's faced with the expenses of medical equipment  accommodations for 2+ months of recovery  extensive physical therapy and home health care  replacing her totaled truck and then slowly easing back into a more regular lifestyle and training. For Kaitlyn  2019 was to be a year of transitioning toward training and racing as a professional mountain bike athlete. Instead  her racing goals are temporarily pushed to the back burner  and she's beginning 2019 setting goals around accomplishments like being able to get out of bed and into a wheelchair without assistance. If you're able to contribute even a few dollars to help support Kaitlyn through this recovery process and get her back on track toward recovering fully and completely regaining her strength and fitness  she will be filled with so  so much gratitude. All the love and healing vibes she has already received from everyone has helped motivate and inspire her to remain positive and focused on recovering! Recognizing that not everyone has the means to contribute financially  messages of encouragement  cards  inspiring decorations  and anything else that can be sent through the mail will reach her at the address below.

Ultimately  it was found that his hemoglobin was a 6 and normal is between 12 and 16  he had a hole in his stomach that was quaterized  and 6 ulcers. The MRI showed he needed surgery on his back due to a fracture caused by other issues. After another blood transfusion  he had his surgery on November 26  2018  which included a laminectomy  a bilateral hemi laminatomy  a medial facetectomy  and a foraminotomy   . For those of you who do not know Michael let me tell you a bit about him. He had a hard life growing up but that didn’t change him for the worse. Michael is hardworking  loving  and selfless. He goes beyond for those he loves and for those he does not even know. More times than I can count  he has been there and neglected his own happiness and well-being to make sure someone else is taken care of. Michael works 2 jobs and is up every morning at 2 am and doesn’t get home most nights until 7 pm. He has done more than I could ever ask for our family and has never complained once. He stepped up and has taken care of my daughter Mackenzie. He raised her as his own for almost 20 years doing all the things a good father would do after her biological father decided not to be in the picture. Back in 2014  when Colton was born  James (Colton’s dad) who was 15 at the time  was left homeless. His mother passed away when he was 14 and shortly after his father had to be put in a nursing home. Michael did not hesitate and he took custody of James and has stepped up and did all the things a parent would do for him including helping him graduate  making sure he had health ins  and so much more. He has taken care of all 3 kids as if they are his own and never complained or asked for anything in return. This is also a man who helps others we don’t even know. He donates toys for the poor at Christmas  helps me collect things year round for the homeless  donates his time and abilities to those who cannot afford to pay someone (including fixing cars for free)  and has even opened up  our home to homeless individuals (more than once) and helped them get back on their feet. Prior to this we were collecting things for a homeless community and even in all this mess he is asking me to make sure I finish what we started.Michael will need continued care including another endoscopy in about 5 weeks. Unfortunately  Michael has no health insurance due to not being able to afford it at this time and is not eligible for Medicaid or state insurance. We will be applying for charity care but that may not be approved and will certainly not cover all the expenses we have and will incur. He will be out of work for several weeks and is the main source of income for our home. Our savings are depleted as we bought our home last year in August and then had the issue 8 months later in March that destroyed our kitchen  which the insurance did not completely cover.So now he needs help and I am asking all of you to please donate what you can. If you cannot donate  please help anyway you can by sharing this and continuing to pray for him and his recovery. Thank you all for taking the time to help. May God continue to bless all of you and your families."

What was supposed to be a brief and fast visit  quickly became an overnight stay for a CT Scan  blood work  urine samples  fluid drain and 2 ultrasounds. By 11 AM  she was informed a semi-solid mass  measuring 6.8cm was found on her left ovary and a cluster of enlarged lymph-nodes around her kidney.She was referred to a GYN Oncologist and on 1/30/19 she received the diagnosis of Serous Ovarian Cancer  Stage 3 at age 29.On 2/7/19 She was scheduled for surgery for a portocath placement so she was able to receive chemotherapy every 21 days.On 2/13/19 Cecily had her first round of chemo at Kaiser Permanente. Her treatment plan is for a combined 6 rounds of chemotherapy  plus a full hysterectomy midway; which is a 4-6 week recovery  tentatively scheduled for the end of April/beginning of May.Meanwhile  Cecily was tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene (Breast Cancer Gene) and a mutation was found in one of her BRCA1 genes  which puts her at an increased risk of breast cancer  as well as ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Cecily  unfortunately  has no health insurance as she was working multiple jobs to support herself and her family. With this diagnosis  Cecily has had to cut her work hours down to 20 hours a month (based on health and well being) and is now relying on family members for financial support  as she has now emptied what savings she did have.After treatment is completed  Cecily will still have frequent CT Scans  lab work to monitor a potential re-occurrence as well as mammograms and breast cancer screenings as she is now considered to be at high-risk for breast cancer.All funds raised will go towards medications  office visits  her monthly bills and living expenses. Our Cecily is still her positive self and remains extremely hopeful with her ridiculous sense of humor through this entire process. Any and all help is appreciated in every aspect."

We will keep this page updated as time progresses.Elizabeth is 21 years old and just starting her life and career in animal care.  She is employed at ACE Pet Resort in Sarasota FL as an assistant manager and she describes her experiences there akin to going to summer camp every day.  It's not an easy job because it takes passion  a strong work ethic and unconditional love for animals.  She has all of this and more.  Recently she took in a foster dog from Vintage Paws  Kenny  who had advanced lung cancer.  She gave Kenny the best remaining 8 months possible with her love and incredible care.Elizabeth has been blessed with many passions in life. She has a very diversified love of music and plays the guitar and sings.  When she was 14 she fell in love with a rescued Thoroughbred horse that was being nurtured back to health. Cayenne has been with Elizabeth ever since and this love of animals has become the cornerstone in which we have built all of our lives.  Regardless of being at stage 2 or 4  the treatment will require chemotherapy.  The types of chemo that will be used during treatment will have a devastating impact on her physically and will have long term effects on her future. She will be seeing specialists throughout this process and will undergo therapies to mitigate some of these long term effects - most of which are outside of her health insurance plan.  Although we don't have an exact cost estimate  we are to understand these particular costs could exceed $15 000 - none of which are covered by her insurance.Total financial impact.  Chemo and radiation  and most all other standard tests and procedures should be covered by insurance  however the co-pays  travel and her inability to work during this time will have a serious impact on her and her family.  At this point  we don't have an exact amount but we are estimating a total financial impact that could exceed $25 000.The positive news is that there is a cure for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cure involves chemotherapy and radiation to start.  She is in the early stages of the planning and getting ready for treatment.  She will receive at least two chemo treatments in this process  and if the cancer is at stage 4  the chemo treatments will extend to 4 to 6 months.  Please help if you can. Elizabeth has been incredibly strong thus far however if you or anyone you know has been impacted by cancer you know how devastating this will be in so many ways.  Her family and friends are positive she will beat this and will continue being an inspiration and blessing to all animals.  If you are unable to donate  please share this gofundme account  leave a message of your support  say a prayer and keep us in your thoughts as she battles through this.With love and appreciation  Nancy and Matt Smallwood."

I have worked as a Travel Nurse all over the country and spent the last few years at the Presbyterian Hospital located in Espanola  NM after making Santa Fe  NM my permanent residence about 4 years ago.  This magical place  Santa Fe with a community like no other which has embraced  supported and encouraged me in ways I am overwhelmed and eternally grateful for.    On October 18th  2018 a bronchoscopy confirmed a non operable Lung Cancer due to high up lymph node involvement.  A few days later  the most  unfortunate news came from an MRI of the brain which showed multiple  scattered cancerous lesions which had migrated from the lung to my entire brain.    Because of the brain involvement  my cancer was diagnosed at Stage IV.   I am not a candidate for radiation therapy at this time  as it would be whole brain radiation because it is so widely spread throughout my brain and whole brain radiation would be both debilitating as well as  leave me with a very poor quality of life and function.  There was actually a little good news in all of these unexpected findings.  The pathology reports of the lung biopsies showed a unique gene mutation which has been responsive  to a newer targeted  therapy called Tagresso.  This treatment  is a little easier on a person than standard chemo infusions  and initially allows for a better quality of life.  The bad news...this treatment only works for so long and will never \"eradicate\" the cancer.  The goal is to control any progression until the cancer outsmarts the drug and mutates again making this treatment no longer valid.  The current studies In The New England Journal of Medicine show this drug as giving a person anywhere from 1 year to 2.5 years with no cancer progression.  Without this treatment  I am told I had 1-2 months to live.   I began taking Tagresso on November 1  21018. Many people have had legitimate questions and I would like to answer them as well as let you know the involved costs  concerns and obstacles I am facing. The Tagresso Medication costs an average of $14 000 - $15 000 per month and at this time has been  covered by my health insurance for the first few months.  At some point  however   insurance WILL  stop paying and when this happens   I will apply for assistance from the pharmaceutical company to hopefully help off set the extraordinary cost of treatment.    Because of my brain involvement   and the possibility of brain swelling and/or seizures and the impairment of my coordination   I am unable to operate a motor vehicle and also unable to perform my duties as an RN.   Although I do have health insurance    I have a high deductible plan which required a $5 000 deductible which was quickly met in October at the time of my initial  testing  workup and diagnosis.  As of January 1  2018  I will then have to meet a $5000 deductible AGAIN  in order to keep my providers and care consistent.My biggest hope and goal is to get to MD Anderson in Houston for a 2nd opinion as these folks are the best!  Only being given one option of treatment for such a limited time leaves me determined to get to the experts for their knowledge and opinion as I am determined to beat this!  So  in the mean time  you will find me embracing and enjoying every God given day and moment to the best of my ability.  You will find me writing music  writing a book  recording an album  spending time with friends  family  my dog  and best friend Maggie  and my love Mathiew.   You will also find me working within the community on volunteer projects in order to give back and pay it forward and feel connected to my community.  You will find me working for trade such as helping my friend out at her salon in exchange for hair care services and products.  You will find me focusing on rest  healing  nutrition and the power of positive everything.  Now that you have the whole story  perhaps it helps you to better understand my situation  prognosis and financial concerns.  The cost of getting to MD Anderson for a second opinion varies and is expected to be anywhere from $5000 to $10 000.  I will update this information as soon as I hear from them regarding the specific costs.   So  this is what I am asking for your help with   and although I am currently blessed enough to have this fairly normal quality of life at this time  there are many things going on behind the scenes I choose not to bring to the table when in public.  Things like the  skin changes  and painful neuropathies  that make it incredibly uncomfortable for my skin to touch anything from clothes  to bed sheets  mouth sores that make eating and drinking painful and challenging  rashes to my face and skin  stomach issues we wont get into here   tender fingers making it painful to play guitar or wash dishes and depression and disconnected feelings from the multiple medications I am on.   But  none of this will  stop me from seeing my friends when my weekly Platelet and Neutrophil Counts are good.  And this will NOT stop me from playing and writing music and participating in live performances and  singing my heart out at every opportunity.  This will NOT stop me from laughing with each and every one of you as much as possible.  And this will NOT stop me having hope and believing in miracles.  This will NOT STOP ME FROM LIVING LIFE TO IT's FULLEST POTENTIAL!I have already been hospitalized once so far for several days due to brain swelling which caused slurred speech and tongue deviation.  I am now on daily meds to prevent siezures and to attempt to control brain swelling.  I hope this has helped to answer your questions and to have a better understanding of my situation.    As a Native American friend once shared with me  it is important to get up every day and give thanks to your God of choice or to recognize your spirituality or to acknowledge and embrace the Sun.  Whatever it is that inspires you!   To count our many blessings and to say out loud  \"Today is a good day to live  and Today is a good day to die. ...I choose to Live today!\"  And I couldnt agree more! Here's to life!!!  Please feel free to pass this along and share!  Thank you  from my heart  to yours."

He assumed the weird dizziness he was feeling was a response to the ongoing stress caused by turmoil surrounding Alison’s job. That morning  she was let go from her position as a museum educator after nearly 14 years of building creative and dynamic programming that served the Akron community.By that evening  Chris was feeling worse. He was extremely dizzy and couldn’t get up off the floor or stop vomiting. He was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. After a long night of monitoring  doctors concluded that Chris had suffered a large cerebellar stroke. But that was only the beginning. A day later  Chris’s brain began swelling and he required emergency surgery to relieve the pressure. The procedure saved his life  but in the ensuing days  Chris developed pneumonia and acute kidney injuries. For five days  he remained intubated as a partially collapsed lung kept him from breathing on his own.Chris fought for his life and won. Now the hard work of recovering from the stroke begins. This week Chris will head to Edwin Shaw Rehabilitation Hospital  where he will work to regain walking  balance and other basic skills. Because of the job loss  Alison will need to make large monthly COBRA payments to her former employer to keep health insurance.

For the past 22 years  he has been living with a heart condition called Dilated Cardiomyopathy. This was due to a virus  the common cold  attacking his heart muscle damaging it beyond repair. In 1997  at 27 years old  he had to stop working and became \"Mr. Mom\" to our two girls and our son that was on the way. In 2005  he had a defibrillator implanted and subsequently has had three separate occasions in which it shocked him to save his life. In March of 2018  he was hospitalized for a week due to his heart weakening. His medication was increased and a few changes made. At the end of June  he returned and was admitted to CVICU. After a heart catheter procedure  my daughter Ashley and I were brought into the consultation room and given the news Ron was in need of a heart transplant. We were in total shock and it wasn’t until the next day the doctors broke the news to Ron. Devastation and disbelief are the only two words to describe what he was feeling.Once they got his heart pressures under control  he was given the option of an internal heart pump  LVAD  left ventricular arterial device or go home with an IV pumping medication to his heart to stay alive. The upside to the LVAD was he would be moved to the transplant priority list and for one thirty day period he would be moved up a tier on the list.With a lot of convincing  he decided to get the LVAD surgery. On July 10th  the device was implanted. He was put on temporary dialysis and received several blood transfusions and left the hospital 3 weeks after surgery.  Ron has gone to weekly LVAD clinics and cardiac rehab appointments 3x’s a week. He has had a very hard time adjusting to living on batteries and having to plug in to an outlet at night. The dressing changes for the cord coming out of his stomach have gotten more tolerable as they went from once a day to every 3 days. His appointments are now spread out to only once a month with a quick weekly blood draw. Ron is an amazing husband  father  and grandfather to our 3 children; Ashley (26)  Alexis (24)  Austin (21)  and Brantley (6) who adores his papa. Ron has been a father figure to neighborhood kids  classroom parent  neighborhood watch  and a softball coach for the past 20 years. Everyone who meets Ron loves him and everywhere we go somebody knows him. We joke and call him the mayor of Summerville. He means so much to those who know him. After explaining all of this  Ron and I were told before the LVAD surgery  we needed to start fundraising for his heart transplant. We have private health insurance  but our out of pocket costs along with the medications needed will be astronomical and I will have to take leave from work to be his caregiver. The great news is MUSC has moved him up one tier on the transplant list for the next 30 days!My family and I will do whatever it takes to help Ron. If you can spare any amount  my family would be more grateful than I can possibly ever tell you. Please share his story and keep my wonderful husband in your thoughts and prayers."

Most cancer patients spend more for out of pocket medical expenses than was anticipated.  Sean was lucky that he was able to continue working while undergoing chemotherapy last fall.  Unfortunately  he hasn't been able to return to work due to complications from his treatment.  His future treatment plan is not yet finalized but will include more chemotherapy  radiation and surgeries.   We have set up this page to help Sean and Vickey with the cost of current and future expenses. While being treated Sean worked with the American Cancer Society to effect change in Maine state law to require health insurance to cover cancer screening for younger patients.  He was hoping to testify at a public hearing on this bill but was back in the hospital and had his statement read before the legislators instead.  Below Sean will give you his story in his own words:I am Sean Riley of Falmouth  ME husband and father of a daughter and son. I am currently recuperating from my 2nd of several anticipated cancer surgeries.  I still recall the sinking look on my wife Vickey's face when we were told that I had cancer. In my heart I knew something was not right but when those words are spoken it officially becomes your family's most life changing moment.  I am an otherwise healthy individual and never expected to be battling cancer in my mid 40's. I am 6 ft 178 lbs and see my doctor annually and have little to complain about medically. My cancer story starts back in spring of 2018 when I noticed some small rectal bleeding and blood in my stools. While alarming  I initially didn't think it was significant enough to rush to the emergency room. I wondered if I ate something bad  had a virus or was this really blood at all? My older sister had several large polyps removed in the summer of 2017 and her doctor recommended all her siblings be proactive and be screened too. I waited a week and then discussed it with my wife and told her I was reaching out to my Primary Care Doctor and requesting a colorectal cancer screening asap. Unfortunately it took several weeks to get into my primary care and then 5 months to have a colonoscopy. This waiting time was not easy  symptoms did not stop and I continued on with life hoping for the best results during my scope in the fall.  Unfortunately my results revealed stage 2 colorectal cancer that spread to my liver. I was quickly entered into a treatment plan. Thankfully after reviewing my colonoscopy results and some additional testing my medical team concluded my cancer was treatable  operable and survivable. It would be a long fall  winter and spring with 2 rounds of chemotherapy  radiation and several cancer surgeries. I continued working and driving the kids to and from school daily (400 miles a week). Chemotherapy was Oct through Christmas and then a week of amped up Radiation treatment ended in January of 2019.   I had my first surgery Feb 12th which was successful in removing the tumor from my colon. I returned home and to work 12 days later. Unfortunately after recovering from my surgery I developed a nasty infection. My return to work lasted 1 day as severe lower back pain sent me back to the operating table. A procedure to place a pelvic drain in my right buttock (haha) was used along with antibiotics to reduce the infection. This was a torturous 3 plus weeks. The infection pain was relentless even with painkillers and the drain location was just as painful as I was unable to sit or even lie on my back for more than a few minutes. Worse  the sutures that would allow me to reverse my iliostomy were leaking  causing fluid to create a pocket right below my tailbone. This meant delays in healing and moving forward to treat the liver cancer and reattaching my digestive system to normal functions. Unfortunately tissue is often damaged and weak from radiation making surgical recovery complicated. I was readmitted to the hospital for a week of IV medication and pain management.  In late March the decision was made to operate again after CT scan revealed my sutures were not sealing. The procedure was to clean the infection  move the pelvic drain to the front abdomen where it is less painful  check colon sutures and transplant healthy abdominal tissue into the infected pocket to promote blood flow and healing.I am now home again. I am not on pain killers anymore yeah... I am recovering and gaining strength slowly after dropping 20 lbs post surgeries and 30 lbs overall. I now resemble the skinny kid you remember (with gray hair...) I hope to return to work soon. Missing work has been tough both financially and personally. I can count on 1 hand the number of days I had missed work in 29 years. Vickey and the kids have been strong but it has been tough on everyone including family far and near. I am not a social media person I would much rather be in the company of the ones I care about than send a text  post or tweet (remember the Dominican...) Unfortunately that isn't always possible as we live such hectic lives. I was asked if I would be interested in a go fund page and I was initially hesitant. After hearing family members tell me about relatives and friends reaching out and their desire to help this made our decision easier. I am not private about my fight against cancer in fact I hope my story will help another family or individual choose to get screened. As I told the American Cancer Society and wrote in my statement to the State Legislature  if I can help one person not have too suffer the way I have then I will do whatever I can. Funds will go to paying my medical expenses including the copays  coinsurance and patient portions of bills that do and will continue to pile up. I was meticulous about not letting one bill get overlooked as our family is getting ready to close on our new home in Brunswick Maine. While I was recovering I worked with the American Cancer Society in Maine to help pass legislation (LD555) to lower cancer screening ages requiring medical insurance to pay for earlier tests for at risk patients to age 45 instead of 50. This adheres to the new medical guidelines. If you are 45 ask your doctor about being screened for colorectal cancer as it is the 2nd highest cancer killer in the country. If I was screened at 50 my situation would have not been as optimistic. Enough preaching....

It can wreak havoc on one's finances and the ability to just keep paying the bills in order to live.  Anyone facing the daunting task of healing and getting well shouldn't have to worry about going bankrupt or losing everything.  It's very clear that Jenny will be unable to work and while she has health insurance  it will not cover the cost of all her care. It's time now for us to send all the care and support we can spare to see her through the enormous challenges that lie ahead.  Anything  even the smallest amount  that you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Everything we can do to envelope her with healing thoughts and love is incredibly important so that her energy can be focused on beating this thing.  I will be posting regular updates and if you feel so inclined  please spread the word.  I thank you and I know Jenny thanks you from the bottom of her heart."

Triple-negative cancer is hard to treat; it has a high recurrence rate and the first round of treatment is the most critical to survival. Laurie is currently in the middle of a 16-week course of chemotherapy  which will be followed by surgery and probably radiation therapy. Active treatment is expected to go through April  or possibly longer depending on how well it works  and full recovery from surgery may take longer than that.   In the meantime  Laurie is unable to work during treatment and  as a longtime freelance writer & editor  is not eligible for any EDD/state or local disability benefits. Her emergency savings is dwindling fast  so we  The Love Team  are raising funds to help her and her 7-year-old daughter  so Laurie can fully focus on healing.

Before that  due to the cytogenetic features of her leukemia cells  she was moved from the Standard Risk treatment protocol to Very High Risk treatment protocol  a regimen that is more intensive and requires four additional week-long hospital stays for inpatient chemo administration.

We had hoped with all our hearts that this horrific and unexpected event would not repeat itself.Anahi was rushed to the hospital where an emergency cerebral catheterization and craniotomy were performed.

It was a very rainy morning  and he was heading to work to help a client get ready to leave the country. Jay’s brakes went out on his car. In a desperate moment  taking quick action to avoid hitting or hurting anyone else  he used his emergency brake and swerved into a tree.  The accident was bad and Jay is badly injured.  What we know so far is that he’s in the Trauma ICU unit with multiple injuries  including a broken back and is unable to lift his arms.  Jay is a hairdresser  lives alone in Dallas  TX and does not have health insurance.Current Situation:On Monday  February 11th  2019.  Friends were able to briefly visit Jay in the ICU.  At the time he couldn’t move his legs and only slightly move his hands.  To our knowledge his family lives in Arkansas.  He was receiving a breathing treatment when we managed to see him.We apologize for the limited information.  We are not family and due to HIPAA the hospital will only give us very limited information.   The true extent of his injuries is still unknown. We have no idea how long he will be in the hospital or how long his rehabilitation will take.  We will make updates to the campaign as soon as we have more news from the hospital doctors. Jay is very worried about how he will pay for the hospital  doctors  his rent and just survive without an income.  He feels terribly alone and has no one to help him but his friends.  Not having insurance  the hospital will soon start pressuring him to make payments which he is unable to afford. We would greatly appreciate it if you can help in any way. He’s in God's hands. Please pray for him. About Jay (James Long):Jay is seen by everyone that knows him as completely unselfish.  Every time you are around Jay  he is completely focused on you and never himself.  He has always been a ray of sunshine for anyone that came into contact with him.  He remembers everything you’ve ever told him about yourself or your family and is always quick to recall and ask about you and your family.  We need to give some of that back to him -- the care and love he deserves and needs.How will the fund be used?:The funds will be used to pay for Jay’s outstanding medical bills and living expenses.  The hospital bill he is facing will no doubt be astronomical. Our Message to you:  We would like to thank each and every one of you for any and all prayers  shares  or donations to help Jay through this incredibly difficult time. We’d like to have all of you who are able  to please visit Jay.  He will appreciate all the love and support anyone can give.  Every call and message will help him and give him a little more hope and strength to push on and fight for a full recovery."

I didn't see it as my role. But my love for Lucia and the Cordúa family is great and their immense local value to Houston is without question. Like countless Houstonians (and many beyond our city)  I love these good people and want to help.Lucia  her chef husband Michael Cordúa  and their chef son David Cordúa (& Michael's business partner) were some of the very first people to make me feel like Houston was my home and that I belonged here. Their embracing hospitality was genuine  but it's far from unique to me. They have been doing that in Houston for more than 30 years  deflecting and humbly acknowledging accolades  while continuing to serve  give back to  and help enhance our city. While Michael and David generally get the spotlight  people who know the family understand that it's Lucia's fire  kindness  warm heart  and open mind that are at the core of their family's values  organizations  and actions. About LuciaIn addition to her role as mother of 4 and grandmother to 5  Lucia is a licensed Acupuncturist and Oriental Medicine Diplomate. She currently cares for and treats many patients around Houston and in College Station. She specializes in all varieties of physical pain  menopause discomforts  and facial acupuncture. She takes an active role in providing care and assistance for her clients. In her acupuncture practice  she believes balancing helps everyone attain happiness and health. She's also a great deal of fun to be around. She always has a keen observation  a caring ear  and a flair for hospitality.  Lucia's Diagnosis & TreatmentTrue to form (and surprising no one who knows her)  Lucia has responded to the diagnosis and current treatment with strength  grace and a determined  positive outlook. Treatments naturally take their toll  but Lucia's spirits and focus are in the right place and her doctors are optimistic about the anticipated results.However  her doctors at MD Anderson have recommended an aggressive chemotherapy treatment to begin in January  which will last for six months. During this period  her ability to tend to her own patients will be significantly diminished as she rests and gives her body a chance to regain its health. Houston & The Cordúa FamilyLucia and her husband Michael opened Houston's first Central American restaurant in 1988  and in their 30+ years continuously contributed to and supported the Greater Houston community and its nonprofit organizations. As their son David grew up and became a local chef himself  he also became a important supporter of Houston in his own right. The family has been an active supporter of St. Thomas University  The Houston Zoo  Houston Food Bank  Strake Jesuit  Casa de Esperanza  American Leadership Forum  Casa Juan Diego  Save our ER  Children at Risk-Houston  Community Foundation  Duschene Academy  and more. The Cordúas have served on boards  helped to raise money  given their time  and prompted others to contribute as well.The Financial NeedWhile supported by health insurance  the affiliated medical bills and associated costs remain daunting and continue to add up. Every dollar raised  minus GoFundMe's small transaction fee  will go directly to helping cover Lucia's medical bills  lost income from recovery  and related expenses. I initially set this fundraising goal at $5 000  based on GoFundMe's best practices recommendations  but we're all pleased to see that the amount raised has far surpassed it. Every dollar is needed. Consistent with GoFundMe's recommendations  I have continued to raise the goal as the donations grow. This is my decision to help my friends and is not coming from them. Like anyone facing cancer treatment  their actual need is significantly and substantially higher and is not going away.Anything you are able to commit is sincerely and humbly appreciated. Both the Cordúa family and myself will reach out directly to thank you for your generosity and support. None of us expect it and all of us are ridiculously grateful for what has been shared to date. Your SupportI'm asking you to help support this family  one of Houston's key culinary legacies and community supporters  in whatever way you're able as they battle and face off against Cancer and the high costs of medical care.Anything you have to offer Lucia—including love  kind words  and encouragement—is humbly appreciated by my dear friends in the Cordúa family and by myself on their behalf. Thank you for taking the time  consideration  and energy to consider this request. With much gratitude and respect  Chip Rankin365Houston.comPhoto credit: Phaedra Cook  founder of Houston Food Finder .

I am very much in need of reliable transportation and we do not have the funds to purchase a new vehicle. Therefore  the funds we need will secure the purchase of a used car and cover the cost of medical bills not covered by our health insurance. Specifically  in regard to our $20 000 goal  we want to allocate $13 000 dollars towards a dependable car and $7 000 towards medical bills. Our children and I are working as a team. They want us to get through the next seven weeks as stress free as possible  since this time period is already going to be so very difficult for us. A reliable car will lessen our stress greatly. Not just during the next two months  but afterwards  since Chris will continue to have follow-up doctor appointments and testing  for at least five years. Another reason for a dependable vehicle  is to secure transportation for the children in my care. Although we do not have a specific deadline in mind  there is a sense of urgency since treatment as already started and ends in mid-March. We want to extend our deepest gratitude for any donation you feel comfortable giving to our cause. We will also greatly appreciate it if you share our GoFundMe link to your Facebook Timeline."

"Medical","November 9, 2018","Josh&apos;s Journey To Health","$15,777","$30,000","130","5","139","808","BUFORD","GA","Thank you for taking time to read our story.About two months ago  Nickie and I asked for prayer on social media. At that time  we were intentionally vague as we wanted to be respectful of our son Joshua's privacy  as well as give ourselves some time to sort things out and to process what exactly our family was facing. Since then  we learned that our son Josh (21 years old) was going through a psychosis event. Without getting into the personal details  Mental Health America (MHA) defines psychosis as a mental disorder characterized by a disconnection from reality  and is a general term to describe a set of symptoms of mental illnesses that result in strange or persistent thoughts  perceptions  behaviors  and emotions. We took Josh to the hospital and he underwent psychological treatment for the next 7 days in an in-patient facility. Unfortunately  it was more of a holding facility than a treatment facility and the overall experience was more traumatic than helpful  leaving us with as many questions as answers. He has since been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist every couple of weeks  but the treatment does not appear to be coordinated. As a result  he is not making the strides we were hoping and praying for and is really struggling to get better. Most recently  he entered another psychosis event  making it extremely difficult for him to communicate his thoughts with any clarity. However  on Sunday  November 4th  and several times since then  Josh asked for help and he is eager to get admitted into a facility that can provide the professional expertise he needs while equipping him with the tools and resources enabling him to not merely cope  but to experience long term health  wholeness  and Christ-centered transformation. With that in mind  we diligently began researching our options and found what we believe to be the perfect facility. The Honey Lake Clinic  located four and a half  hours away  in Greenville  FL  is the #1 Christian mental health program in the US offering individualized 24/7 care. (More info can be found on their website   www.honeylake.clinic)Honey Lake Clinic offers Bible-based  psychological care by licensed experts in scenic  world-class accommodations and has an incredible reputation for helping their residents reclaim their lives and achieve their God-given potential. Quite frankly  there is not another facility in the country that compares. Honey Lake Clinic only offers a residential program with a 30 day minimum stay  but after speaking with the staff  and acquainting them with Josh's unique situation  they felt he would be a great fit. With excitement  Nickie  Josh and I began to jump through the initial hoops  but our hearts sank when we found out that our health insurance would not cover any of the costs and self pay patients must have payment in full prior to admission. Instead of accepting this as the end of the road  and after much prayer and consideration  we have decided to reach out to our extended family  friends  and anyone else who would be generous enough in partnering with us to help with the costs and facilitate this amazing opportunity for Josh.The cost for 30 days is an overwhelming $30 000. Thankfully  the facility offered us a $12 000 scholarship  leaving a cost of $18 000. There are some other costs as well  and 80% of the residents stay longer.

Most cancer patients spend more for out of pocket medical expenses than was anticipated.  Sean was lucky that he was able to continue working while undergoing chemotherapy last fall.  Unfortunately  he hasn't been able to return to work due to complications from his treatment.  His future treatment plan is not yet finalized but will include more chemotherapy  radiation and surgeries.   We have set up this page to help Sean and Vickey with the cost of current and future expenses. While being treated Sean worked with the American Cancer Society to effect change in Maine state law to require health insurance to cover cancer screening for younger patients.  He was hoping to testify at a public hearing on this bill but was back in the hospital and had his statement read before the legislators instead.  Below Sean will give you his story in his own words:I am Sean Riley of Falmouth  ME husband and father of a daughter and son. I am currently recuperating from my 2nd of several anticipated cancer surgeries.  I still recall the sinking look on my wife Vickey's face when we were told that I had cancer. In my heart I knew something was not right but when those words are spoken it officially becomes your family's most life changing moment.  I am an otherwise healthy individual and never expected to be battling cancer in my mid 40's. I am 6 ft 178 lbs and see my doctor annually and have little to complain about medically. My cancer story starts back in spring of 2018 when I noticed some small rectal bleeding and blood in my stools. While alarming  I initially didn't think it was significant enough to rush to the emergency room. I wondered if I ate something bad  had a virus or was this really blood at all? My older sister had several large polyps removed in the summer of 2017 and her doctor recommended all her siblings be proactive and be screened too. I waited a week and then discussed it with my wife and told her I was reaching out to my Primary Care Doctor and requesting a colorectal cancer screening asap. Unfortunately it took several weeks to get into my primary care and then 5 months to have a colonoscopy. This waiting time was not easy  symptoms did not stop and I continued on with life hoping for the best results during my scope in the fall.  Unfortunately my results revealed stage 2 colorectal cancer that spread to my liver. I was quickly entered into a treatment plan. Thankfully after reviewing my colonoscopy results and some additional testing my medical team concluded my cancer was treatable  operable and survivable. It would be a long fall  winter and spring with 2 rounds of chemotherapy  radiation and several cancer surgeries. I continued working and driving the kids to and from school daily (400 miles a week). Chemotherapy was Oct through Christmas and then a week of amped up Radiation treatment ended in January of 2019.   I had my first surgery Feb 12th which was successful in removing the tumor from my colon. I returned home and to work 12 days later. Unfortunately after recovering from my surgery I developed a nasty infection. My return to work lasted 1 day as severe lower back pain sent me back to the operating table. A procedure to place a pelvic drain in my right buttock (haha) was used along with antibiotics to reduce the infection. This was a torturous 3 plus weeks. The infection pain was relentless even with painkillers and the drain location was just as painful as I was unable to sit or even lie on my back for more than a few minutes. Worse  the sutures that would allow me to reverse my iliostomy were leaking  causing fluid to create a pocket right below my tailbone. This meant delays in healing and moving forward to treat the liver cancer and reattaching my digestive system to normal functions. Unfortunately tissue is often damaged and weak from radiation making surgical recovery complicated. I was readmitted to the hospital for a week of IV medication and pain management.  In late March the decision was made to operate again after CT scan revealed my sutures were not sealing. The procedure was to clean the infection  move the pelvic drain to the front abdomen where it is less painful  check colon sutures and transplant healthy abdominal tissue into the infected pocket to promote blood flow and healing.I am now home again. I am not on pain killers anymore yeah... I am recovering and gaining strength slowly after dropping 20 lbs post surgeries and 30 lbs overall. I now resemble the skinny kid you remember (with gray hair...) I hope to return to work soon. Missing work has been tough both financially and personally. I can count on 1 hand the number of days I had missed work in 29 years. Vickey and the kids have been strong but it has been tough on everyone including family far and near. I am not a social media person I would much rather be in the company of the ones I care about than send a text  post or tweet (remember the Dominican...) Unfortunately that isn't always possible as we live such hectic lives. I was asked if I would be interested in a go fund page and I was initially hesitant. After hearing family members tell me about relatives and friends reaching out and their desire to help this made our decision easier. I am not private about my fight against cancer in fact I hope my story will help another family or individual choose to get screened. As I told the American Cancer Society and wrote in my statement to the State Legislature  if I can help one person not have too suffer the way I have then I will do whatever I can. Funds will go to paying my medical expenses including the copays  coinsurance and patient portions of bills that do and will continue to pile up. I was meticulous about not letting one bill get overlooked as our family is getting ready to close on our new home in Brunswick Maine. While I was recovering I worked with the American Cancer Society in Maine to help pass legislation (LD555) to lower cancer screening ages requiring medical insurance to pay for earlier tests for at risk patients to age 45 instead of 50. This adheres to the new medical guidelines. If you are 45 ask your doctor about being screened for colorectal cancer as it is the 2nd highest cancer killer in the country. If I was screened at 50 my situation would have not been as optimistic. Enough preaching.... Hopefully this summer I will be recovered from liver surgery and finishing 3 months of chemo  and starting a new chapter of my life as a cancer survivor and advocate. Peace and Love to you all Sean Vickey Nia Nevin Thank you for considering donating to Sean and his family and for sharing this page with anyone you feel would like to help!"

It can wreak havoc on one's finances and the ability to just keep paying the bills in order to live.  Anyone facing the daunting task of healing and getting well shouldn't have to worry about going bankrupt or losing everything.  It's very clear that Jenny will be unable to work and while she has health insurance  it will not cover the cost of all her care. It's time now for us to send all the care and support we can spare to see her through the enormous challenges that lie ahead.  Anything  even the smallest amount  that you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Everything we can do to envelope her with healing thoughts and love is incredibly important so that her energy can be focused on beating this thing.  I will be posting regular updates and if you feel so inclined  please spread the word.  I thank you and I know Jenny thanks you from the bottom of her heart."

It was a very rainy morning  and he was heading to work to help a client get ready to leave the country. Jay’s brakes went out on his car. In a desperate moment  taking quick action to avoid hitting or hurting anyone else  he used his emergency brake and swerved into a tree.  The accident was bad and Jay is badly injured.  What we know so far is that he’s in the Trauma ICU unit with multiple injuries  including a broken back and is unable to lift his arms.  Jay is a hairdresser  lives alone in Dallas  TX and does not have health insurance.Current Situation:On Monday  February 11th  2019.  Friends were able to briefly visit Jay in the ICU.  At the time he couldn’t move his legs and only slightly move his hands.  To our knowledge his family lives in Arkansas.  He was receiving a breathing treatment when we managed to see him.We apologize for the limited information.  We are not family and due to HIPAA the hospital will only give us very limited information.   The true extent of his injuries is still unknown. We have no idea how long he will be in the hospital or how long his rehabilitation will take.  We will make updates to the campaign as soon as we have more news from the hospital doctors. Jay is very worried about how he will pay for the hospital  doctors  his rent and just survive without an income.  He feels terribly alone and has no one to help him but his friends.  Not having insurance  the hospital will soon start pressuring him to make payments which he is unable to afford. We would greatly appreciate it if you can help in any way. He’s in God's hands. Please pray for him. About Jay (James Long):Jay is seen by everyone that knows him as completely unselfish.  Every time you are around Jay  he is completely focused on you and never himself.  He has always been a ray of sunshine for anyone that came into contact with him.  He remembers everything you’ve ever told him about yourself or your family and is always quick to recall and ask about you and your family.  We need to give some of that back to him -- the care and love he deserves and needs.How will the fund be used?:The funds will be used to pay for Jay’s outstanding medical bills and living expenses.  The hospital bill he is facing will no doubt be astronomical. Our Message to you:  We would like to thank each and every one of you for any and all prayers  shares  or donations to help Jay through this incredibly difficult time. We’d like to have all of you who are able  to please visit Jay.  He will appreciate all the love and support anyone can give.  Every call and message will help him and give him a little more hope and strength to push on and fight for a full recovery."

Our hope is to continue her acute inpatient stay at TIRR Memorial Herman until early March and to see continuing improvement.  Thereafter  Mia will be transitioned to a subacute outpatient rehabilitation facility for an additional three to six-month stay at one of several candidate facilities  including The Centre for Neuro Skills and Pate Rehabilitation Hospital.Unfortunately  rehabilitation is extremely expensive - with a daily rate of over $3 200 for 45 days at TIRR Memorial Herman  and it is being paid for out-of-pocket to enable Mia’s ongoing medical care.  Like many physicians  who worked as contractors  Mia did not qualify for health insurance through an employer  so she purchased individual insurance.  Sadly this (and every other) individual health insurance plan does not cover rehabilitation costs at TIRR Memorial Herman or elsewhere.  Following her release from TIRR  the subacute outpatient care will cost between $850 and $1 100 daily  and insurance will not cover these costs either.    We’re asking for your help with the cost of her stay at TIRR so that Mia can continue on the path to recovery and resume her life as the active mother of two beautiful teen-aged daughters  partner to fiancé Ted  loving daughter and sister  and an amazing friend to so many.  Our family is deeply grateful for your help in Mia’s journey to recovery.  Your contributions  prayers and supportive words are invaluable.  - Rose"

Troy Roark sat in for him on drums.  I checked my texts on the first break ….. “I’m just going to put it out there” the text began  it was from Nat  “I’m in really bad shape  I have Acute Myeloid Leukemia  I’ll be in the hospital at least 4 weeks.”  My heart literally sank into my stomach  I gasped  “acute”  this diagnosis is a very tough one and a massive uphill fight – long  long term.  Nat is committed to following the team of Doctor’s orders.  Many of you know Nat as a drummer and hand percussionist and real estate appraiser.  Others know him from The Cross Fit Community and even others from Barnes & Noble  Custom Cup Coffee or his recent favorite coffee haunt Three Twigs Bakery.  Nat has made friends from all walks of life and he and his family have been generous to those in need.   They hosted a foreign exchange student from the Netherlands for a year.   He has hosted/promoted bands  covering costs so that the people of Springfield could experience world class music.  Almost 2 years ago his youngest daughter asked if they could take in a young woman who was in the US on an asylum visa and found herself homeless.   That is how Natasha  a student at Lincoln Land  became part of the Radwine family.  Name a holiday and the Radwines will have an extra seat at their family table filled with someone who had nowhere to go.  Many of you will remember  back in the day Nat and his brother David owned Crow’s Mill School where they had legendary bands and served memorable food.  Nat’s heart is totally in his family (Carol  Zack  with Courtney and the grandkids  Zoe  Mira and “informally adopted” daughter Natasha)  his dogs Stella and CoCo  his bandmates and his community.  Now he needs our help.  Being self-employed  Nat has no paid benefit time and his income stopped cold on March 16th when he was admitted to Memorial  where he remains  receiving treatment.  He is fortunate to have good health insurance through Carol’s job but his ability to earn a living has been put on hold and treatments will be ongoing for months or years.   Their youngest daughter Mira is a sophomore at SIU-E  and before this diagnosis  Nat and Carol’s plan was to keep working well past college expenses.  A bone marrow transplant may be needed which would require him to be transferred to Barnes in St. Louis.  When he was admitted to Memorial  doctors and nurses told them it would be a long road  but that is only beginning to sink in.  The Radwine family needs our help.  Can you be generous?  REALLY generous?  Can you help the Radwines?  Nat and Carol have always been quick and generous contributors to any good cause  (including opening their home and wallet to others in BIG ways)  and now they need us.  If not us  who?  If not now  when?Please give the absolute best gift you can  put yourself in Nat’s place  or in Carol’s.  Would you want to count on your friends to pitch in?  And please PLEASE share this campaign with all of your friends and family.Thanks so much from us  his Emerald Underground Bandmates  and from Nat  Carol  Zack (Courtney and grandkids)  Zoe  Mira and Natasha"

This is unfortunately where we find our dear friend Holly Phares  after an infection on the skin of her ankle took a turn for the worse  and spread to the bone. Doctors at Jefferson Hospital have performed the necessary surgery to help save her foot  but she now faces an extended hospital stay as her rehabilitation and physical therapy become paramount. It's more than likely she will  transfer to another facility  or much to her chagrin a nursing home  where she will continue her PT and OT. Her beloved Comfort Cottage is not wheelchair accessible so any rehab there seems unlikely.  She has multiple IVs running very strong antibiotics into her system on a regular basis. This treatment will continue for 6 weeks.Due to the soaring cost of health insurance  Holly finds herself uninsured and facing what is sure to be extensive medical bills and lost wages. She works many jobs as a musician  and makes just enough money to keep her from qualifying for Medicare. She is working with a social worker and others from the hospital to apply for as much assistance as possible. Holly wants you to know she is in great hands at Jefferson. She feels safe and cared for  and has miraculously ended up with a private room. She is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love she has received and is eternally grateful. I spent almost an hour on the phone with her tonight  and haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  My name is Ryan Fleming. I am her friend  student and colleague. She has thousands of these friends all over the world  and cherishes each one of us. Won't you please consider donating to help Holly navigate this very stressful and scary time in her life. Money raised here would mean more than just bills paid  it would mean peace of mind and a return to the life she so cherishes.Blessing to you all!Ryan"

Over the past decade the disease has escalated its efforts to weaken his body  but it hasn’t weakened his spirit or sense of humor. He’s been through a kidney transplant  experienced vision impairment  had multiple amputations ultimately leading to two leg amputations  and more. Through it all he’s continued to be an amazing father and friend.The LatestAt the end of 2017 Dan underwent his second leg amputation. The surgery was successful  but it took time for it to heal and for him to learn how to walk with two prosthetics. Additionally  he experienced several other health issues that doctors are still trying to figure out.As Dan tried to work though all of this in early 2018  the WA Department of Revenue decided it was time to audit his company. However  since he was in and out of the hospital and dealing with his health and recovery  Dan couldn’t respond in time  so the Department of Revenue executed a “desk audit” and without any documentation or evidence from Dan they determined he owed over $250k to the state.From there the state garnished all his money causing Dan to miss a couple health insurance premium payments  leading to the cancellation of his health insurance. Since then we’ve spent months trying to figure out how to get coverage for Dan  how to deal with the state  and most importantly how to solve the myriad of health issues he’s dealing with daily.We believe we are on the right track but unfortunately the costs for continued medical treatment and life-sustaining medications are extremely high making it hard to keep up with medications and doctor appointments  ultimately causing additional health issues.  Why GoFundMe?We are trying to raise money to cover Dan’s medical and basic living expenses for a couple of months  so we can make sure he gets his medications  makes it to his doctors appointments and so he can focus on obtaining insurance coverage  getting resolution on the state issue  and getting his body back to normal. By donating or sharing this GoFundMe to others you’d be helping an amazing father and friend through a difficult time. We thank you for your consideration in sharing his story and/or donating.We know if there’s one thing Dan is not shorted by  it is the amount of love and support you have provided him. Thank you from us both.Justin & Morgan"

I am 1 in 10. I am 31 years old and I have stage 4 endometriosis and had stage 4 Adenomyosis. There is no cure for these illnesses  and the lack of coverage of healthcare and my medical bills  are drowning me.  As private as I am and have been  my back is against the wall and for my health's sake  I am hoping this can help me. I was diagnosed ten years ago but recent years it has gotten to a point where I have lost a part of myself entirely  I have gone through chemotherapy twice in the last year  7 surgeries in all (since diagnosis ) with another on the way  chemically induced menopause 3 times  a total abdominal hysterectomy in December and last but not least  my ovaries -- being the only organ of my reproductive system I was able to keep after surgery  which is a very vital organ; has now failed me. So thats six organs  an ENTIRE ORGAN SYSTEM that I have lost within a year. Which now leads me into  trying to figure out my life from here  with being on medication for the rest of my life and just sort of coming into my own that I can not have my own child  I can never freeze an egg  that is a chapter of mine I have to close and find closure and comfort within myself in time. The last few years of my life are a blur of tests  throwing up  crying  sleeping on bathroom floors  surgeries  chemo  sleeping in the shower with the water falling on me  being in constant horrible pain  being in the hospital  losing my hair  being poked and pried with constant tests invasively  and because of it all I have become extremely shut off. I have finally been able to come to a part of my journey where I am letting my walls come crashing down  because if I don't open  up and reach out -- I don't know that my mental can take much more. I know people often question where I went  or what happened-- so here I am  letting my walls down with raw honesty. I am drowning in medical bills  sure health insurance does help but not all medication  treatments  tests  surgeries   co insurances -- are all not covered. I'm opening up because I am looking to bring awareness  to get my health back and get back to MORE LIFE. I want to inspire  show all the girls that will come after me going through the same thing that they are NOT ALONE! For so many years I was told so many different things  they tried so many things and it just made it worse.I have been a science experiment for a long time and I am truly tired. I have now found a doctor who has a very good plan for me to get my health back  my insurance doesn't cover a lot of the bills  and especially this last year with chemo and my hysterectomy things got very expensive   so with that being said I have decided to put up a go fund me. This is a no pressure situation  I would never judge a single soul for not donating  It took me a lot of thinking about even putting myself out there like this  if I would be judged or looked at weird -- but to be honest  I just want to be healthy and get my life back so I can love life again and bring positivity to the world and be comfortable in my own skin. I want to share my story with the world and save the future from having to go through the torture I have endured from an\"invisible illness\". Maybe with me  they can find a better route to help the future. It is referred to as an invisible illness  there is no medical imaging to detect it  every time they need to check out whats going on inside of someone like me -- they have to do it through laparoscopy ( a camera surgery they stick in your abdomen)  So with all this being said  I would appreciate it and promise to bring awareness to this physical and emotional massacre of an illness that someone at such a young age has to endure. I just want my life back. Thank you for even taking the time to read this and Thank you to the ones who end up donating to help me with my medical bills  I appreciate you all and Sending love to you all  if anyone knows anyone who can relate and needs someone to talk to -- please contact me.  I am here. Love First  Love Always. More Life  JackieArtwork done by: Amar Stewart"

Crazy how much things can change overnight. I sit here hooked up to IV’s finishing up my first day of chemo and felt it a good time to send an update. For those who don’t know  a month ago I was diagnosed with a unicorn cancer of the vagina. Its called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina and is the first in the state of WI  less than 50 cases ever have been reported.I had surgery to remove a cyst at the beginning of January which had been bothering me for months. My lack of health insurance  fear of out of pocket costs and the fact that I’m stubborn prevented me from addressing the issue earlier. Due to the aggressiveness of the cancer doctors are sure I haven’t had it very long. I had a second surgery two weeks ago to remove affected lymph nodes. I just had my first radiation treatment  which will be 5 days a week for the next two months. Thursday I started chemo and will most likely start another treatment called immunotherapy  after radiation is complete.The next few months are going to be forever changing. I want everyone to know that I am honestly OK. Regardless of the future  I’m OK. I’ve accepted what’s taking place and embracing this as a learning and growth opportunity. I will be losing my hair  I will have physical and emotional struggles but  I am more than prepared to fight this. Much of this is out of my control  but I can control my attitude. I’m staying positive and am still feeling grateful.Please understand that I may not be able to respond to messages or calls. I have a lot going on. I appreciate the outpouring of love and support. Feel free to send funny  inappropriate or happy texts  messages or snaps. I will keep you all updated. Much love!***Many of you know and love Tasha Cheney.

She has been unable to return to work as a kindergarten teacher. I’d like to share her story now.Meredith has always been a healthy active person. She was a swimmer. She chased after a daughter and her 2 twin boys  now 16 and 13 years old  and cheered them on through soccer  baseball and football games. She was even willing to manage other people’s children as an elementary school teacher! Kindergarten no less! She  herself  runs primarily on Mountain Dew  which I will never understand. But I guess we all have our vices. She also worked in extended day  spending her afternoons running around playgrounds with these kids after a day teaching kindergarten. Until this fall. When her vision changed. And she developed a few other weird neurological symptoms. And then had to pull off the road after school and call for a ride to the ER because her symptoms had worsened to the point she didn’t feel safe to drive.She was hospitalized  underwent a brain biopsy for a suspicious mass. And shortly after came the news- Brain Cancer. Non-Operable. Not curable. The plan is to begin chemotherapy and radiation to destroy as much of the cancer as possible.  It is unknown whether her vision will improve. It is unknown when or even if she will be able to return to work. It is unknown how much time we have left with Meredith. We do know that  even with health insurance  she will have mounting medical bills. She has already started receiving the bills for her ER visit and hospitalization. And continued living expenses  including her mortgage and utility payments. She will run out of paid leave within 1-2 months  even with the donation of leave time by her generous fellow teachers- thank you! Meredith is 44 years old. Her daughter is 16  a junior in high school  a member of the national honor society and thinking about where she will go to college. Her twin boys are 13 years old  8th graders  and thinking about their next moves on Fortnite and how to complete homework as quickly as humanly possible. Please help support Meredith during this time. Please consider donating to this fund so Meredith can focus on her children  her family and friends and her upcoming treatment with one less worry. Your donations will be used for medical expenses and to help cover her and her children’s living costs.

How her story ends is up to you. Help us get an asylum-seeking world-changer back to her Ivy League full-ride (and to selflessly serving those in need) by sponsoring her medical recovery.WHERE HOPE IS NOWAmazingly  Hope has already seen substantial health improvements when she’s been able to access consistent medical help. She’s determined to re-enroll at her Ivy League University during the '19/'20 school year  exact time dependent on her recovery speed. However  she’s exhausted her money for medical treatment and currently eats at homeless shelters. She’s legally in the US since she’s applied for refugee status  but during the slow wait for approval  she is barred from all state/federal support services such as Medicaid.If Hope stays in the US without the medical support to return to her Ivy League University  her untreated health issues will likely end her life  or render her permanently hospitalized.If Hope goes back to her home country  her family will most likely find her and kill her in the name of protecting the family’s honor.This is more than just Hope's life  though. Hope worked extensively in high school with non-profits which empower vulnerable women and girls  and intends to leverage her American education to continue that world-changing work. Hope’s recovery would mean uplifting for so many beyond just her.WHAT HOPE NEEDS TO RECOVERThis is where you come in. Your support will cover the basic needs crucial to Hope’s recovery over the next 8 months and re-enrolling at her Ivy League University the '19/'20 school year:Monthly costs:Health Insurance: $500Medical co-pays: $450Medicines (inc.inhaler  supplements): $250Wellness (gymn  yoga etc): $200Transport: $100Events  conferences  etc: $120Food  groceries etc: $180Therapy: $200Housing: $0 (thanks to a very generous someone!)Total: $2 000/monthJan-April Costs update:Actual avg cost per month for first 4 months (Jan-April): $2 700/month or $10 800 total spent.

It is managed by Eleanor Collier  who has extensive experience handling budgets from running student organizations and working as a residence assistant at Stanford  and who currently manages a research laboratory . Each month  Eleanor works with Hope to calculate precisely the funds needed at the most granular level possible (individual medical costs  food  transportation  classes  etc)  withdraws that amount from GoFundMe to Eleanor's bank account  then sends the funds directly to Hope via Venmo (both transactions  produce a digital record we're happy to provide for verification; following this method of transfer also means funds are being sent and used exactly for the purposes outlined here as verified by Eleanor). Eleanor then records the exact breakdown of expenses in a secure document  and Hope keeps records on-hand of where money gets actually spent  which Eleanor reviews before sending the next month's money (records are kept private for privacy reasons  but Eleanor's happy to answer questions or provide more details about breakdowns  without compromising privacy). Our aim is 100% transparency and accountability  so we're eager to provide any additional details you'd like.Will this actually help Hope long-term  rather than just make her dependent on others?Yes. 100% of the money will go to directly put Hope back in her Ivy League University  where she’s studying computer science  a program which will position her atop the financially lucrative technology job market  and more able than ever to build solutions to help the vulnerable woman and girls she worked extensively with in high school. The medical treatment will also increasingly restore her ability to work and support herself in the short term.Hope is fiercely independent. She has been incredibly hesitant to receive outside support because she doesn't want to lean on others. She finally agreed to support because she knows it is the only option for her to be fully independent in very the near future.How can I be sure this isn’t a scam? Why can’t I know Hope’s full name?Eleanor Collier (Eleanor.A.Collier ‘at’ dartmouth ‘dot’ edu)  David Mora (davidmora ‘at ‘cs.stanford.edu)  Nikhil Desai (nikhildesai ‘at’ google ‘dot’ com)  and Danish Shabbir all personally know Hope and vet her story. We’d be happy to call with you to address concerns and share 3rd party verification. For privacy and safety reasons  however  we’re not publishing Hope’s identity publicly on the web.I'm short on money but rich in love. Are there other ways I can help Hope?Yes! Please contact Eleanor Collier Eleanor Collier (Eleanor.A.Collier ‘at’ dartmouth ‘dot’ edu) or David Mora (davidmora ‘at‘ cs.stanford.edu) for more info on other ways you can contribute to Hope's material and emotional needs."

We spent our days being home schooled by our mother  traveling on missionary trips to Romania and the Philippines and helping our parents with the developmentally disabled adults they cared for. In 2010  our mama was diagnosed with Breast Cancer where she fought a courageous battle for years until 2012. When we lost our mama  our world turned upside down. In 2014  our papa suffered from a minor stroke and a heart attack to follow a few months later. He remained healthy and strong following.In 2015  papa started school for welding and metal fabrication at WCTC which he really loved. He also worked as a Tae Kwon Do instructor for years...he is so great with the young kids and thoroughly enjoyed being a part of their accomplishments! Most recently  papa's been working as a maintenance manager at an apartment complex. But his recent big love is working as security and roadie for the band  The Crisis. Our family has grown over the years with the people who've entered our lives through those avenues.On Monday morning  our papa suffered a major stroke with a serious brain bleed. He also was diagnosed with a mild heart attack and aspiration pneumonia. Papa was medically sedated to allow his brain to heal. This week has been a long road for us. While we are trying make sense of papa  there are many other things we  as his children  have been faced with. Beside medical decisions  we are faced with responsibilities we were not prepared to handle.  We are now faced with paying all the bills  including mortgage- electric- phones- home/vehicle insurance and Aubrey's Badger Care/health insurance. There is no credit card debt nor any other excess spending. We live modest  if we can't pay for it  we don't buy it. Papa currently does not have health insurance either  however we are working with a social worker to file for Badger Care. He was denied for October which includes 3 days of this hospital stay. We are praying they approve him for November. We are working on trying to get the bills paid for this month. We do not have access to our papa's bank accounts so we have no idea what financial situation we are facing. We do live paycheck to paycheck. Our situation is very precarious as papa did not have a Power of Attorney or Advance Directive so until the court can appoint a guardian  we need to be sure we are able to care for ourselves and our home. Papa's medical status is very critical. He is paralyzed on his entire right side and his left side has little to no voluntary movement. His brain bleed has not gotten any better and the swelling in his head remains the same as when he was admitted into the ICU.  Papa's condition is on a day by day basis- we don't know what tomorrow will bring but we pray for God's healing hands. He is still in the ICU and will remain for the unforeseeable future. We have been taught by our parents to work hard and we do. Aubrey has started school this week and we know that we will need to get full time jobs to care for ourselves and papa. Our papa was never one to ask for assistance or help financially and it's really difficult to accept the position we are in. We pray that we can have time to be with our papa and our family during this difficult time and not need to worry about making sure we have a home to return to.  We know that the help we receive now  will be paid back to others in our future. Please Pray for our papa and our family.Thank you for all the love and support TJ  Shaphan and Aubrey Nabong*Many have asked how they can help in additional ways.

Our hope is to continue her acute inpatient stay at TIRR Memorial Herman until early March and to see continuing improvement.  Thereafter  Mia will be transitioned to a subacute outpatient rehabilitation facility for an additional three to six-month stay at one of several candidate facilities  including The Centre for Neuro Skills and Pate Rehabilitation Hospital.Unfortunately  rehabilitation is extremely expensive - with a daily rate of over $3 200 for 45 days at TIRR Memorial Herman  and it is being paid for out-of-pocket to enable Mia’s ongoing medical care.  Like many physicians  who worked as contractors  Mia did not qualify for health insurance through an employer  so she purchased individual insurance.  Sadly this (and every other) individual health insurance plan does not cover rehabilitation costs at TIRR Memorial Herman or elsewhere.  Following her release from TIRR  the subacute outpatient care will cost between $850 and $1 100 daily  and insurance will not cover these costs either.    We’re asking for your help with the cost of her stay at TIRR so that Mia can continue on the path to recovery and resume her life as the active mother of two beautiful teen-aged daughters  partner to fiancé Ted  loving daughter and sister  and an amazing friend to so many.  Our family is deeply grateful for your help in Mia’s journey to recovery.  Your contributions  prayers and supportive words are invaluable.  - Rose"

Troy Roark sat in for him on drums.  I checked my texts on the first break ….. “I’m just going to put it out there” the text began  it was from Nat  “I’m in really bad shape  I have Acute Myeloid Leukemia  I’ll be in the hospital at least 4 weeks.”  My heart literally sank into my stomach  I gasped  “acute”  this diagnosis is a very tough one and a massive uphill fight – long  long term.  Nat is committed to following the team of Doctor’s orders.  Many of you know Nat as a drummer and hand percussionist and real estate appraiser.  Others know him from The Cross Fit Community and even others from Barnes & Noble  Custom Cup Coffee or his recent favorite coffee haunt Three Twigs Bakery.  Nat has made friends from all walks of life and he and his family have been generous to those in need.   They hosted a foreign exchange student from the Netherlands for a year.   He has hosted/promoted bands  covering costs so that the people of Springfield could experience world class music.  Almost 2 years ago his youngest daughter asked if they could take in a young woman who was in the US on an asylum visa and found herself homeless.   That is how Natasha  a student at Lincoln Land  became part of the Radwine family.  Name a holiday and the Radwines will have an extra seat at their family table filled with someone who had nowhere to go.  Many of you will remember  back in the day Nat and his brother David owned Crow’s Mill School where they had legendary bands and served memorable food.  Nat’s heart is totally in his family (Carol  Zack  with Courtney and the grandkids  Zoe  Mira and “informally adopted” daughter Natasha)  his dogs Stella and CoCo  his bandmates and his community.  Now he needs our help.  Being self-employed  Nat has no paid benefit time and his income stopped cold on March 16th when he was admitted to Memorial  where he remains  receiving treatment.  He is fortunate to have good health insurance through Carol’s job but his ability to earn a living has been put on hold and treatments will be ongoing for months or years.   Their youngest daughter Mira is a sophomore at SIU-E  and before this diagnosis  Nat and Carol’s plan was to keep working well past college expenses.  A bone marrow transplant may be needed which would require him to be transferred to Barnes in St. Louis.  When he was admitted to Memorial  doctors and nurses told them it would be a long road  but that is only beginning to sink in.  The Radwine family needs our help.  Can you be generous?  REALLY generous?  Can you help the Radwines?  Nat and Carol have always been quick and generous contributors to any good cause  (including opening their home and wallet to others in BIG ways)  and now they need us.  If not us  who?  If not now  when?Please give the absolute best gift you can  put yourself in Nat’s place  or in Carol’s.  Would you want to count on your friends to pitch in?  And please PLEASE share this campaign with all of your friends and family.Thanks so much from us  his Emerald Underground Bandmates  and from Nat  Carol  Zack (Courtney and grandkids)  Zoe  Mira and Natasha"

This is unfortunately where we find our dear friend Holly Phares  after an infection on the skin of her ankle took a turn for the worse  and spread to the bone. Doctors at Jefferson Hospital have performed the necessary surgery to help save her foot  but she now faces an extended hospital stay as her rehabilitation and physical therapy become paramount. It's more than likely she will  transfer to another facility  or much to her chagrin a nursing home  where she will continue her PT and OT. Her beloved Comfort Cottage is not wheelchair accessible so any rehab there seems unlikely.  She has multiple IVs running very strong antibiotics into her system on a regular basis. This treatment will continue for 6 weeks.Due to the soaring cost of health insurance  Holly finds herself uninsured and facing what is sure to be extensive medical bills and lost wages. She works many jobs as a musician  and makes just enough money to keep her from qualifying for Medicare. She is working with a social worker and others from the hospital to apply for as much assistance as possible. Holly wants you to know she is in great hands at Jefferson. She feels safe and cared for  and has miraculously ended up with a private room. She is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love she has received and is eternally grateful. I spent almost an hour on the phone with her tonight  and haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  My name is Ryan Fleming. I am her friend  student and colleague. She has thousands of these friends all over the world  and cherishes each one of us. Won't you please consider donating to help Holly navigate this very stressful and scary time in her life.

On 12/22/2019  Taylor felt a lump in her left breast and five weeks later  she was in her first chemotherapy session. She's been diagnosed with Stage 2A invasive ductal carcinoma  a very common  yet aggressive breast cancer. She is early stage  with a ER+  PR+  HER2- pathology (a favorable treatment profile). The doctors and Taylor have a good outlook  and she is looking forward to being on the other side of this  with new eyes full of wisdom! She does have a tough road ahead. She will begin with 5 months of ACT chemotherapy (the hard stuff) to shrink the tumor  then on to surgery  and 5-10 years of hormone therapy. She is a full-time biologist for our nearby coast and ocean  and while she will continue working part time  she will have to give up a lot of field work during treatment  as it requires handling dead animals. Taylor has been on the Bay Area hustle of also bartending at the Rite Spot  and has to let that source of income go to focus one healing and recovery. During the next year  she won't be able to work the 50 hours/week she's accustomed to. She is incredibly grateful to have good health insurance  but the costs of care and recovery in the Bay Area are tough when your hustle has been put on hold. Taylor says  “I know many of you out there also need a hand just as much  if not more. Smiles  hugs  prayers  and jokes are also warmly accepted!\"And if you feel moved to give  it is with deep gratitude and humbleness that she accepts your kindness.

Since that date  she's been recovering in the ICU where she remains in critical condition.  The doctors are unsure how long she will stay in the ICU  but she could be there for 21-45 days.  Once she is done in ICU she will go to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital where she will receive OT  PT  and Speech Therapy.  Due to her injury  Rebecca will need to re-learn many skills such as walking  talking  and other activities of daily living.  Rebecca has health insurance.  However  her plan is a high deductible plan and her insurance will not cover all of her expenses.   It is estimated that out of pocket costs for her injury may exceed $20 000.  Many of our friends and family have asked how they can help.  A donation towards my sisters recovery will help my parents to focus on her recovery without the stress of wondering how they will cover the costs of her treatment.  We are encouraged with her progress and expect a full recovery.   Thank you for considering a donation towards her recovery."

Some of you may not. Those of us that know Julie know she is incredibly gifted at finding ways to bring light to those around her. She would rather give than receive and would rather spread smiles than sadness. Many of us have been blessed to be on the receiving end of her infectious laughs  thoughtful compliments  and relentlessly selfless acts of service. Now she needs our help. Just a week before her diagnosis  Julie was downsized from her employment and because of this  she was not able to get health insurance and currently has no income. Although she has diligently researched  fought for  and received a good deal of financial assistance  there are still significant medical bills and life expenses piling up. The PlanDuring her initial hospitalization and diagnosis in July  Julie underwent surgeries to stabilize her immediate health and prepare her for treatment. She has also recently undergone an initial round of chemo and radiation. These first few steps of her treatment are out of the way  but she still has a long journey and significant challenges ahead. The next step is surgical removal of the tumor  followed by recovery and several more months of chemo. We will do our best to post updates here on Julie’s progress as she continues to fight this disease. Julie may also personally share more details and updates here as she feels comfortable disclosing and discussing them. How You Can HelpWe have put together this campaign to help relieve the significant financial burden this situation has placed on Julie  so that she can focus on overcoming the disease. No one should have to face the possibility of bankruptcy due to events completely out of their control. On our own we could do little  but together we can make a monumental impact. Please help our friend face this challenge and give her hope for a return to her ordinary life. Thank you so much for your love and support. XODavid  Rhiannon & Julie’s Cancer Fighting Team!"

Or you may have grown close to him through a shared love of golf  college football  or Americus  GA. For many others  you may only know the family member who requested your support by sharing this GoFundMe page.Regardless of how you know Kellette or his friends and family  the Wade family thanks you for visiting this page and potentially contributing toward the journey ahead.The BackstoryKellette was recently diagnosed with myelofibrosis  a condition of the tissue inside the bone marrow that contains the stem cells that eventually form blood cells. In myelofibrosis  the bone marrow is replaced by scar tissue  and subsequently  there are not enough blood cells created.To address this condition  Kellette will undergo a bone marrow transplant where cells will be taken from the bone marrow of another person  and then transfused into Kellette’s bone marrow to replace the abnormal cells.Following the procedure  Kellette will stay in the hospital for a month as his immune system recovers from the transplant. After this month of treatment  Kellette will able to leave the hospital  but he will be required to live no more than 30 minutes away. This will ensure that if any issues arise  he will have immediate access to the appropriate care essential for a successful recovery.How You Can HelpThis will be a one year process that will involve numerous preparatory treatments  the transplant itself  the quarantine period  and several months living three hours from his home in Americus  Georgia.

He’s a wonderful son  partner  brother  stepdad  and friend. He can’t wait to marry his fiancee Christine. He’s a hard-working and talented carpenter and a gifted chef. He loves live music and travel and a good cup of coffee. And he is always there if you need him. But Josh’s life almost ended on November 25  2018 when he suffered a serious and life-threatening brain bleed. He was rushed to a nearby emergency room and then taken by life flight helicopter to a hospital that specializes in treating serious aneurysms like Josh’s.Josh was one of the lucky ones — he survived. What doctors didn’t tell us at the time was that more than 90% of people in Josh’s situation don’t make it. Doctors also didn’t tell us until later that the small number of people who do survive a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage like Josh’s (the most serious form of aneurysm)  are often in a coma months later. Josh’s experience has been different. He woke up and was able to breathe without life support in just two days.  He made it through a dangerous two weeks when the blood vessels in his brain went into spasms that could have resulted in strokes and his body re-learned to regulate his temperature after daily fevers that threatened his life. Doctors saved Josh with repeated and complicated treatments. Despite the severity of his illness  Josh was walking with the help of a walker – haltingly  with difficulty – within a couple of weeks. He survived in large part because of the excellent medical care he has received. Yet  his recovery has been so unusual that even his doctors and nurses are amazed. They stop by his hospital room just to ask Josh his story. Hospital staff call him the “miracle man.”   The aneurysm left Josh’s body unable to clear fluid from his brain and Josh recently had further surgery to place a permanent shunt to prevent dangerous pressure buildups in his brain. Josh will need lifelong follow-up care with neurologists and other specialists to monitor his health. Josh was in critical condition in the ICU for three weeks. To date  doctors and nurses and air ambulance personnel have provided about $2 million in medical care. Thankfully  health insurance covers a lot of his medical costs  but not all of them. Josh is facing very large medical bills and collections personnel are eager for payment.  It will take hard work and time for Josh to regain his strength. His memory is still fuzzy  he is learning to manage severe headaches that doctors tell us may last weeks or months  and he will need cognitive therapy to sharpen his verbal skills and memory. Doctors can’t say when Josh will be able to go back to work. He will need weeks or months of physical therapy to help him regain function in his left leg and foot. Josh needs your help to complete this miracle. Please consider making a contribution in any amount to support Josh’s efforts in his recovery journey."

The Texas sun sure was a challenge for the big guy  but he found his groove working construction with a long time friend. Unfortunately about 3 months ago  Joe hurt his shoulder and with no health insurance nor funds for medical assistance  he fought thru the pain and proceeded to work a very physical job day in and out. His luck was not great and gained several other injuries mostly impacting his initial injury of his shoulder. As time passed  he became very ill with what hospitals and urgent care stated was the flu. It became unbearable with a 3rd trip to hospital the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving. Again  given antibiotics and pushed along since no medical insurance.  He pushed thru to see friends and family on Thanksgiving. Unknown to all that shared in his presence  that maybe the last time Joe would be seen in his larger than life self. His mother had not heard from him since that day and became concerned. She reached out to his long time friend  Joel  to check on him. To his dismay  he found Joe incoherent on the bedroom floor of his apartment. Luckily for Joe  Joel was able to handle his weight and rushed him to the hospital to later get a spinal tap. Result: bacterial meningitis. He was in very bad shape and no estimates could be given for his survival. He was transferred to a new hospital with an isolated ICU to begin the road to recovery. Here  the hospital also learned that he had a severe infection of the blood and the infection had been pumping thru his body for a length of time.  It was touch and go the 1st week. Luckily  Joe is a big guy and his body was able to handle the stress!! After getting diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes as well  the doctors/nurses struggled to keep him stable. slowly Joe started to become coherent. Break thru in week 2! Large abscess was found in the shoulder that he injured so many months ago  the size of a baseball that started to solidify. Surgeons went to work ridding his body of the infectious abscess. With a pump  lots of IV antibiotics Joe is coming around. The source of all the illnesses and pain that was plaguing his body was found! He is on a LONG road to recovery! Joe will be in the hospital until all bacteria levels are back to normal in his blood  blood/sugar levels are kept normal and body temperature stable. Doctors have no idea as it is a day by day process with many tests. We hope  for all the doctors/nurses sake that Joe is back at home on the mend as his over the top personality is hard to contain!! Once released he will have to undergo IV antibiotic treatments everyday for 4-6 weeks.as well as starting a new regimen with insulin and diet. IF this was all he is up against  that would be AMAZING!  However  the blood infection pumped thru his whole body affecting his heart and muscles. He is very weak and cannot walk or get up on his own. road to recovery is 3-6 months once final treatments are made. At the end  the hope is that he is back to his vibrant self!! Joe has been trying to stay cheery and be proactive. working with a social worker to hopefully obtain some level of charitable health insurance and possibly disability. The social worker is not optimistic about much aid coming thru. With no health insurance  or savings his family has been helping pay his rent until he can get back on his feet  no pun intended... I am reaching out to all his friends and family that he has spread his contagious laugh and witty personality with to help Joe on his journey from death bed to life! He will need help with medical bills  medications  therapy  and everyday life expenses until we see him on his feet ready to share large hugs with all!"

The family stayed in the pediatric ER all night until Olivia was stable enough to be admitted.  I must admit I really didn't realize the seriousness or severity of this disease until the coming days.  In a matter of a couple hours  Olivia's innocent 2 year old life along with her families was turned upside down.  Olivia’s parents were told in the ER at Beaumont that her levels were over 600 and had they not brought her in when they did  she would’ve been in trouble by the morning.  While in the hospital Olivia was being poked at least 8 times per day to check her blood sugar  and she was injected with two types of insulin any where from four to six times per day on top of numerous tests and lab work.  Mom took a month off work  and Dad took a week.  With a family of 4 kids and 2 adults  mom and dad both work full time to make ends meet.  Olivia couldn't go back to daycare until her blood sugar was regulated and mom could figure out how she would be able to monitor her levels and how she would get her insulin.  Children with Type 1 Diabetes need to be monitored 24 hours a day  even while they sleep so  Olivia was given a continuous glucose monitor to wear.  The monitor tracks Olivia’s blood sugar levels throughout the day and makes the information readily available to her Mom and Dad throughout the day and night of course until little Olivia decides she doesn't need it anymore and rips it off!  Brian and Emilie have decided that because Olivia is so young and doesn't understand her diagnosis or the need for insulin and her monitor  and cannot always communicate how she is feeling  that they need an additional resource to help them keep her safe. After much research the family decided that a diabetic alert dog would be an amazing asset to Olivia’s care team.These dogs are amazing!  They are trained by scent and can tell and alert their companions and caregivers if their blood sugar is either to high or to low  up to 20 minutes before any monitor can.  This is especially important in children as they are not yet able to do the monitoring themselves.  They are trained to bring their companion a snack if they are too low  which can be life saving.  And so much more.Of course insurance does not cover the cost of the Diabetic Alert Dog (DAD)  which can take up to 18 months to train.  Emilie has found a wonderful place to obtain a DAD for Olivia.  They require about a $4000.00 deposit to start training the dog.  Once the dog is trained Olivia and her family will have to travel to where the DAD is located and spend a week with the trainer.  The total cost including travel arrangements are estimated to be around $20 000.00.  There will be an ongoing expense of health insurance for the dog  vet and food expenses as well.  So we are asking for anyone who knows sweet  silly and beautiful little  Olivia  if you are able to help by donating  we all would be eternally greatful!  Please share this with your friends and family also  every dollar we can raise is a dollar to make Olivia’s  life safer!  Thank you so much!"

She always has a smile on her face and an infectious laugh no matter what may be happening in her life. She has received a devastating breast cancer diagnosis as well as a complicating heart valve problem found during her diagnosis  yet with all this bad news she is the one comforting her entire family while searching for a silver lining for herself.After visiting the country of Panama Christie and her daughter  Shelby  fell in love with the people and the country. Living in the country for several years in a small village she embraced the community generously giving her help and support to the village  the indigenous women  and most importantly the children. She has helped teach them English and often provides them with food  toys  and educational supplies. One of her greatest joys is hearing the children shouting \"Christina  Christina!\" happily as she walks through the streets. Christie started her own business \"Pure Panama \" a skincare line in which she purchased her coconut oil from the indigenous women and hired them to work in the production of her products. Her daughter founded a program called \"Light the Path\" to provide solar lanterns to the children to use in their homes to do schoolwork as the sun sets early and the majority of people have no electricity. Christie has had an open heart and never thought that she would be stricken with an aggressive breast cancer. Each facet of the diagnosis kept bringing more critical news including a heart valve problem that limits her ability to receive chemotherapy treatment. She is now facing overwhelming expenses for the surgery and ongoing treatment she needs to receive. She needs our help now more than ever to meet these costs  and any contribution you can make would help make a difference. Christie’s Cancer Story:Christie has recently found out more specific information on her breast cancer as the results have begun coming back. Her cancer has been diagnosed as a very aggressive type called HER2+. Due to numerous factors and the size of her tumor  she is battling Stage 3 of the HER2+ type. The cancer has formed in her lymph nodes as well. Her cancer is aggressive and the cells are about to start multiply and divide. Because of the severity of the cancer  she is having to relocate to Medellin Colombia for immediate treatment. She is however working with a world class team of doctors who are putting her case at the top of their priority. Christie will need extensive treatment that includes chemotherapy  surgery  radiation  and hormone therapy which doctors are saying that it may take up to a year or longer for this treatment. Christie’s Heart Failure Story:                The oncologists in Colombia made it clear to Christie that treatment for her cancer must begin immediately and that she needed to get an echocardiogram as a precautionary before beginning chemotherapy. Upon visiting with a cardiologist  it has been discovered Christie has heart failure. This was caused from the Chagas Disease which is known as a silent killer because it is asymptomatic. This rare disease was caused from a tropical bug that has transmitted an infectious parasite that has deteriorated Christie’s heart. This has created multiple challenges as Christie faces the much needed treatment for her cancer. Oncologists and Cardiologists are working together to form a plan best fit for Christie and her unfortunate situation.  When Christie returns to Colombia to reside permanently which receiving treatment  she will begin the process of attaining her residency and securing health insurance. Because of her aggressive cancer diagnosis  treatment will have to begin before she can get health insurance. All costs to the treatment will have to be made up front. We greatly appreciate any support received  all funds will be going directly to Christie's breast cancer treatment."

He’s a wonderful son  partner  brother  stepdad  and friend. He can’t wait to marry his fiancee Christine. He’s a hard-working and talented carpenter and a gifted chef. He loves live music and travel and a good cup of coffee. And he is always there if you need him. But Josh’s life almost ended on November 25  2018 when he suffered a serious and life-threatening brain bleed. He was rushed to a nearby emergency room and then taken by life flight helicopter to a hospital that specializes in treating serious aneurysms like Josh’s.Josh was one of the lucky ones — he survived. What doctors didn’t tell us at the time was that more than 90% of people in Josh’s situation don’t make it. Doctors also didn’t tell us until later that the small number of people who do survive a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage like Josh’s (the most serious form of aneurysm)  are often in a coma months later. Josh’s experience has been different. He woke up and was able to breathe without life support in just two days.  He made it through a dangerous two weeks when the blood vessels in his brain went into spasms that could have resulted in strokes and his body re-learned to regulate his temperature after daily fevers that threatened his life. Doctors saved Josh with repeated and complicated treatments. Despite the severity of his illness  Josh was walking with the help of a walker – haltingly  with difficulty – within a couple of weeks. He survived in large part because of the excellent medical care he has received. Yet  his recovery has been so unusual that even his doctors and nurses are amazed. They stop by his hospital room just to ask Josh his story. Hospital staff call him the “miracle man.”   The aneurysm left Josh’s body unable to clear fluid from his brain and Josh recently had further surgery to place a permanent shunt to prevent dangerous pressure buildups in his brain. Josh will need lifelong follow-up care with neurologists and other specialists to monitor his health. Josh was in critical condition in the ICU for three weeks. To date  doctors and nurses and air ambulance personnel have provided about $2 million in medical care. Thankfully  health insurance covers a lot of his medical costs  but not all of them. Josh is facing very large medical bills and collections personnel are eager for payment.  It will take hard work and time for Josh to regain his strength. His memory is still fuzzy  he is learning to manage severe headaches that doctors tell us may last weeks or months  and he will need cognitive therapy to sharpen his verbal skills and memory. Doctors can’t say when Josh will be able to go back to work. He will need weeks or months of physical therapy to help him regain function in his left leg and foot. Josh needs your help to complete this miracle. Please consider making a contribution in any amount to support Josh’s efforts in his recovery journey."

The Texas sun sure was a challenge for the big guy  but he found his groove working construction with a long time friend. Unfortunately about 3 months ago  Joe hurt his shoulder and with no health insurance nor funds for medical assistance  he fought thru the pain and proceeded to work a very physical job day in and out. His luck was not great and gained several other injuries mostly impacting his initial injury of his shoulder. As time passed  he became very ill with what hospitals and urgent care stated was the flu. It became unbearable with a 3rd trip to hospital the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving. Again  given antibiotics and pushed along since no medical insurance.  He pushed thru to see friends and family on Thanksgiving. Unknown to all that shared in his presence  that maybe the last time Joe would be seen in his larger than life self. His mother had not heard from him since that day and became concerned. She reached out to his long time friend  Joel  to check on him. To his dismay  he found Joe incoherent on the bedroom floor of his apartment. Luckily for Joe  Joel was able to handle his weight and rushed him to the hospital to later get a spinal tap. Result: bacterial meningitis. He was in very bad shape and no estimates could be given for his survival. He was transferred to a new hospital with an isolated ICU to begin the road to recovery. Here  the hospital also learned that he had a severe infection of the blood and the infection had been pumping thru his body for a length of time.  It was touch and go the 1st week. Luckily  Joe is a big guy and his body was able to handle the stress!! After getting diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes as well  the doctors/nurses struggled to keep him stable. slowly Joe started to become coherent. Break thru in week 2! Large abscess was found in the shoulder that he injured so many months ago  the size of a baseball that started to solidify. Surgeons went to work ridding his body of the infectious abscess. With a pump  lots of IV antibiotics Joe is coming around. The source of all the illnesses and pain that was plaguing his body was found! He is on a LONG road to recovery! Joe will be in the hospital until all bacteria levels are back to normal in his blood  blood/sugar levels are kept normal and body temperature stable. Doctors have no idea as it is a day by day process with many tests. We hope  for all the doctors/nurses sake that Joe is back at home on the mend as his over the top personality is hard to contain!! Once released he will have to undergo IV antibiotic treatments everyday for 4-6 weeks.as well as starting a new regimen with insulin and diet. IF this was all he is up against  that would be AMAZING!  However  the blood infection pumped thru his whole body affecting his heart and muscles. He is very weak and cannot walk or get up on his own. road to recovery is 3-6 months once final treatments are made. At the end  the hope is that he is back to his vibrant self!! Joe has been trying to stay cheery and be proactive. working with a social worker to hopefully obtain some level of charitable health insurance and possibly disability. The social worker is not optimistic about much aid coming thru. With no health insurance  or savings his family has been helping pay his rent until he can get back on his feet  no pun intended... I am reaching out to all his friends and family that he has spread his contagious laugh and witty personality with to help Joe on his journey from death bed to life! He will need help with medical bills  medications  therapy  and everyday life expenses until we see him on his feet ready to share large hugs with all!"

The prognosis is good  but her initial treatment will include chemotherapy to shrink a very aggressive tumor and then surgery. Many of us have had friends and family members who have battled cancer and we understand the mental and physical toll it takes on daily life. It is so easy to fall behind and be overwhelmed. Although Erica and her husband  Antonio  do not have health insurance  Erica was able to qualify for a special Medi-Cal program for breast cancer treatment. Even so  there have been and there will be unforeseen and uncovered medical and personal expenses. Erica is also anticipating the loss of income while she recuperates from treatment as her current job with a grocery store offers no sick leave benefits. Meanwhile  Antonio is picking up as many shifts as he can working at Universal Studios (working double shifts when available)  but his hours will likely be reduced after the holidays. Plus  Antonio’s work commute to Los Angeles is a long one (1-2 hours depending on traffic) and he wants to be with Erica as much as possible during her treatment.‘Tis the season when we all have many obligations and distractions  but please help out if you can. Your generosity will help Erica and Antonio meet their financial obligations during a very difficult period in their lives. Whether you know Erica through Aikido  bicycling  or any other activity  you know that she is strong will eventually be declared the winner of this fight  but she needs us in her corner!If you live in the Ventura area  feel free to reach out to Erica and Antonio in any way you feel comfortable  such as checking in with her when Antonio is working  connecting over coffee or a meal  accompanying her to appointments  or help/support with a ketogenic diet.

She is currently recovering from her surgery while waiting for chemotherapy and radiation treatments to begin. She was hospitalized for two weeks but did not have health insurance and is facing enormous medical bills. Val is a wife  mother of three boys  a friend  and devout follower of Christ. She is the most loving  kind  caring  and selfless person  always putting others before herself. Val and her family have dedicated their lives to serving Jesus  always living according to God’s word. She and her husband left everything behind to move to the United States to serve in a missionary church with their three young children and nothing but two suit cases of clothes. They spoke no English and had to make their way. Her journey has not been easy  but she has always confronted every challenge with determination  a positive attitude  and open heart and mind. Val was experiencing severe abdominal pain and visited an Urgent Care Clinic where they performed blood tests and an ultrasound. The test showed abnormal results but did not indicate any serious issues and she was instructed to see an OB/GYN. After seeing an OB/GYN a few days later  the doctor too confirmed nothing serious and was sent home with more pain medication. It wasn’t until several days later of Val suffering excruciating pain  unrelieved by the pain medication she was given  that she went to the ER. This is where further tests were done and several cancerous masses were found in her abdomen and filling her reproductive organs. Current condition and NEED: Val is preparing to fight for her life while awaiting treatments that cost tens of thousands and up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. She needs the emotional support of her husband  Oscild  who is a long haul truck driver that spends weeks at a time on the road to provide for the family. His income is not enough to cover the massive medical costs of these treatments necessary to save her life. Val is a fighter  and is determined to beat this disease.

This all adds up to the reality that the 12 hours a week that Morgan works often feels overwhelmingly difficult.  It means that she’s often pushing herself to do the things that life asks of all of us  but with levels of pain or fatigue that would keep most of us in bed until it was over.  But  for her  it’s never over. Morgan has remarkable stubbornness and has developed many skills and tools to help herself deal with her daily symptoms. However  living with less pain and fatigue would be  a tremendous relief!In December of 2018  we had a court case to determine whether and how much the auto insurance company of the driver who hit Morgan in 2014 would owe us as a liability payment.  We had great hopes that this settlement would provide us with funds that we could invest in treatments that have a hope of providing relief from the symptoms that Morgan experiences.  However  despite the fact that the driver had clearly broken a number of laws  the jury found the driver to not be negligent  meaning that the insurance company will not pay a settlement. The jury reasoned that because they could imagine themselves running through a crosswalk in the same way the driver who hit Morgan did  it must be ok. Unfortunately  there is no possibility of appeal.As a result of losing to the insurance company  we are helping to raise awareness and change the laws so that this won’t happen to other people. Morgan will be working in coalition with Washington Bike Law and other organizations to advocate for a “presumption of liability” law  which would better protect people who are hit by cars  while also being fair to drivers.However  since changing the law won’t change our circumstances  we are reaching out to our families and communities to make it possible for Morgan to receive treatment.  The treatment facility that Morgan has selected is Cognitive FX    which does week-long intensives for people in exactly Morgan’s situation  i.e. people who have ongoing brain injury symptoms which have not been responsive to other types of treatment.  Morgan has chosen this partly because two people she knows and trusts  who have similarly complex  ongoing  and treatment resistant symptoms as hers  have experienced great improvement and reduction in symptoms through their work with Cognitive FX.Cognitive FX does specialized brain scans (fMRIs or fNCIs) that pinpoint which areas of the brain are receiving too much or too little blood.  This gives the practitioners specific information about what kinds of exercises are needed to create the changes in the brain to help the brain work more efficiently and thus reduce the symptoms While no treatment can promise results  we have chosen Cognitive FX as being the most likely to be able to give Morgan the most relief.Thank you so much for considering helping Morgan access this potentially life-changing treatment.

By the time the ambulance took him to the emergency room he had suffered 3 seizures  each lasting about 5 minutes  and had yet to wake up. After an MRI showed a mass in his frontal lobe  the neurologist determined it a tumor. Fortunately  he has no paralysis or brain damage  and was fairly lucid this morning when he regained consciousness. To our relief  he is acting like the same dad we know and love (despite having been heavily sedated). The tumor will need to be removed  of course  at a time yet to be determined.What he needs help with is the financial burden. This has been  in his words  the hardest year of his life  as he took a risk in becoming self-employed and leaving his prior job  and suffered setback after setback. Through his and his loving wife's hard work and sacrifices  they have been able to keep their house. But obviously  this medical development is both untimely and devastating  made worse by the fact that he has no health insurance coverage. Anyone who knows our dad knows he isn't one to ask for help  but we also know there is no way he can pay the looming medical expenses on his own.

Whether rehearsing lines for a play  visiting a sick friend in the hospital or telling you everything you ever wanted to know about an obscure foreign film  Michael is a giving person. The devotion to his friends  joy in sharing passions for theater  comics and music  and the rare quality of his listening are a gift to all who know him.Now I’m asking you to send some of that generosity back his way. The picture  fully known to only a few  is grim. Michael is in daily physical torment due to chronic pain in his head and jaw. Often unable to find and sustain work  he has gone deeply into debt  emptying his savings and maxing out his credit cards. The search for a cure  or anything to even mitigate his suffering  has been a largely futile exercise in navigating the maddening health care and social welfare bureaucracies. The result has not only been ongoing pain and frustration  but fear and anxiety: not knowing when the pain will end; unsure of whether he can ever return to regular work; thinking of the future as one of crushing debt  limited resources and increasingly diminished physical capacity. At this point  he may not be able to pay rent beyond the end of February.Michael needs you.Michael with friend and fellow actor Ted SchneiderThe BackstoryWhat began four years ago as a minor spasm in his jaw has gotten so bad that Michael never goes a day without intense physical pain. He has bounced from one bad diagnosis and ineffective treatment to another. There are days  even after taking pain meds  when Michael can do little more than lie in bed. His inability to find and maintain work has put an enormous strain on an artist’s budget to handle procedures that fall way outside normal health coverage. And state  federal and local organizations that might have helped have either kept benefits at bay completely or put Michael on waiting lists that last more than a year.Lately  however  there has been a glimmer of hope.Michael just recently heard of a new procedure that stops muscle spasms in the jaw by correcting the bite. He found a well-regarded dentist north of Philadelphia who performs the procedure  one of a handful in the world who do it  and his diagnosis and early treatment finally align well with his strange set of symptoms. The CostsBut non-routine dental surgery is extremely expensive. The costs are entirely uncovered by health insurance and are therefore paid out-of-pocket. And there will be several more visits before Michael is back to normal.That’s where you come in.We’d love to hit the goal of $15 000 to cover the costs of an estimated 4-8 visits plus transportation. Any money raised that isn't needed for the procedures will go towards helping Michael pay off debts and get back on his feet as the treatment allows him to return to more regular work.Self-portrait by Michael AvolioHow You Can HelpIt can be maddening to realize that even in 2019  there is no simple way to ease Michael’s pain. At first  there seemed to be no cure. Now  with relief in sight  there is the awesome task of paying for it. When it comes to employment  Michael is in the proverbial Catch-22: He needs to return to work  but in order for that to happen  he first needs some respite from the pain.He needs your help. No donation is too small. It’ll be worth it to see Michael back to his vital self again. After the first of these treatments  Michael felt happier and more hopeful than he has in several years.Whether or not you can donate yourself  please share a personal note about Michael and a link to this page on social media or in emails. It’s hard to exaggerate the ripple effects your help and kind words might have. There are few gifts more precious than health and peace of mind. Collectively  you’ll be helping restore our friend  relative and colleague back to a full life.Thanks and best wishes Andy BrownsteinNote: Please be aware that GoFundMe takes 5 percent out of each donation.

After receiving strange  incoherent text messages from Mark and then being notified that he hadn't shown up for work on time  his wife headed home and had a family member call for an ambulance to meet her at their house. The paramedics transported Mark to Mountain West Medical Center in Tooele for treatment. After realizing the situation was more emergent than they were equipped to handle  Mark was life-flighted to the University of Utah Hospital. When Mark arrived at the U  he was awake and alert. He was unable to speak but able to communicate using hand gestures  facial expressions  and grunts. After a series of scans  it was discovered that Mark had suffered from a left carotid artery dissection which interrupted blood flow and caused a clot to form inside his brain.  A team of neurosurgeons were able to repair the dissected artery using stents and evacuate the clot  successfully restoring blood flow to his brain. At this point it appeared that Mark may be in the clear and our energy should then be focused on how much rehabilitation he would need. Unfortunately  when blood flow was restored Mark suffered a massive hemorrhage causing damage beyond repair and Mark's short life came to an end on March 9th at 3:50am. We are so incredibly thankful for the team working on the Neuro Critical Care Unit at the University Hospital. The remarkable team of nurses  physicians  and surgeons worked tirelessly to save Mark.  Because Mark did not have health insurance  his wife is now left to deal with the devastating loss of her husband as well an incredible financial burden.  If you are able  please consider donating to help Mariah during this impossible time."

In fact  the family has been told more than once that he is a \"miracle\".  We know the outpouring of love from family and friends and the power of prayer are helping his recovery. Most importantly has been the unwavering strength and support he is receving from the love of his life  Becky.  We know the battle is not over for Larry as he has a long road of recovery. We are asking for continued love and prayers. Our hopes for this campaign is to raise enough money to allow his wife to take off from work the full time allowed through the Family and  Medial Leave Act.  For those of you who are not aware  the act mandates that employers allow the time off to eligbile employees; however  it is an unpaid leave. It will be very important for Larry to have Becky by his side through his recovery. It is also important to decrease any stress he may feel due to loss of income. They are blessed with having health insurance; but  there also will be medical bills to pay before this is all over.  If you feel compelled  we would love you to join G-rums' team.

This has meant that my kidneys have slowly been declining  and I recently reached end stage renal failure  meaning I now require a kidney transplant. We are in the middle of the process of finding a donor  but have found a strong candidate in my sister  Tori. Tori is incredibly gracious and is fully on board with donating. I am so thankful for her and for the many who have offered/tried to become donors for me. I am consistently amazed at the generosity of those around me! We are shooting for a transplant date of this spring  or early summer. Thus  as the date approaches  I am realizing  through the wisdom of others  that I should start taking steps to prepare for transplant  not only mentally and physically  but also financially. At this point  we don’t know exactly how much everything will cost. I have health insurance  and we’re hoping to jump into Medicare also and have that cover some of the extra expenses coming in from the transplant  but we recognize that with the costs of a transplant reaching upwards of $300 000 (and extra expenses for travel  lodging  anti-rejection meds   etc.)  the amount I need to cover could yet be in the tens of thousands.  The number we've set here is thus around 10% of the projected costs (obviously hoping that health insurance and Medicare will cover the rest). Thus  I am asking if you would be willing to partner with me in helping to cover some of these costs. I ask you to do so carefully  recognizing that I only want funds to come in and go towards genuine need  and not just to make this process more comfortable. Thus  I am creating several security checks on this  in order to make sure that happens:1) We have created a separate “for the benefit of” bank account to collect all funds. These kinds of accounts are designed specifically for needs such as this  and it allows us to keep track of and make sure the correct funds given are being used for medical and related expenses. The funds from GoFundMe will be directly wired into that account. You can also donate to that account directly by writing a check to: Anna’s Transplant Benefit. 2) I have asked several people to be accountability partners for us in this process. Thus  they will have access to view the funds going in and out of this account  helping to make sure they are being used wisely and correctly. 3) Since we don’t know how much everything will cost yet  I have picked Congo Impact to receive the possibility of extra funds beyond what is needed. You can check out all that they do here:  https://congoimpact.org/I want you to know that I desire to invite you into a process with me. I don’t want to merely ask for financial assistance  but for your partnership as I step into a challenging journey. Thus  I will be posting a series of videos that further explain my disease  what God has been teaching me through it  introduce you to my donor  etc. I also want you to feel free to ask any questions  ask to meet up for coffee  whatever! Thank you for taking the time to read through all this  and more importantly  for your friendship!With gratitude  Anna Vollema"

They have done great renovation work on numerous residential projects around the area  many for my friends and relatives. But unfortunately  this past October  Wally was diagnosed with Anaplastic Thyroid and Lymph Node cancer in the head & neck area. This news came to us as a sudden surprise  considering he is otherwise healthy and in fine shape.I’m friend Geoff  and I’ve known Wally since elementary school  and he was part of our troupe in the McDowell High School Marching Band  playing trombone. Its been a wonderful thing to have a pal like Wally for decades  but now  he needs our help. The “father & son” construction team has to pause for the foreseeable future as its now Wally’s full-time job to fight through the difficulties of cancer treatment  which thankfully is currently underway at the Cleveland Clinic. And Jonathan’s full-time job is to transport and caretake for his father  who is quite weak and feeling terrible. But as you can imagine  medical deductibles and other related health care out-of-pocket costs  along with normal monthly bills and expenses are worrisome obstacles to recovery without an income stream. Therefore  we ask for your kind generosity to raise enough funds to help with their finances during Wally’s treatment and recovery period  in addition to the significant health care bills that preceded the December 1st initiation of their current health insurance policy. Frankly  finding the resources to make the monthly home mortgage and health insurance payments is very challenging and weighs heavy on their minds. Therefore  to take this worrisome financial “weight” off of Wallace  so he can focus on managing the pain that he is in  and to keep his strength up through several months of radiation and chemotherapy  is our primary goal as we look for support through the GoFundMe network of caring people. (As a footnote  we wish to thank the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC for the initial diagnosis and treatment recommendation in November. Additionally  we appreciate the tremendous care currently given by the Oncology team at the Cleveland Clinic.)How you can help more:In addition to donating to this campaign  please consider sharing it with your friends and family on Facebook  email  Twitter  and text message.

This disabling disease is similar to Parkinson’s and Lou Gehrig's or ALS.  Unfortunately there is not a cure.  Every day is a struggle for her to do the daily tasks that many of us take for granted  due to the constant jerkiness of her limbs. Eventually doctors say she will lose her ability to walk and eat.   Upon the onset of this disease Kelly had to stop working.  She lost her health insurance and can not afford it on her own.  She is currently on disability  but will not qualify for disability insurance for a little over a year.  Anyone who remotely knows me knows its’ extremely hard to ask for help. As  her husband  I continues to work daily  at the age of 76 to provide for her healthcare needs  to make her comfortable.  In addition when I come home I take care of the daily household needs  that she is no longer able to do on her own.  We are grateful to have neighbors and church family who have stepped in to assist us when I have to be out of town for work. This week Kelly went to her neurologist and got great news.  She told her that there was a surgery  in Charlotte  NC  that would minimize the jerkiness of her limbs and help her immensely.  This would bring her back some of the freedom she longs for. This surgery will cost between $25 000 and $30 000.  Her neurologist stressed that doing this ASAP would result in the best outcome for her.  If she has to wait another year and a half for her disability insurance  it may be too late.  We are asking from the bottom of our hearts that if GOD leads you to help us make this surgery happen  please consider donating  to our cause.  Any amount will be GREATLY appreciated by our family.  God Bless!Larry Viner"

He had one symptom that prompted him to get screened. We had good news on 11/28  that surgery wasn’t indicated at this time. The plan is to start chemo on 12/10 and let the cocktail do it’s job. However  also on 11/28  we found out that Steve does not have any kind of disability insurance. We are completely losing his income  which accounts for about 2/3 of our household income. We also found out that we will be responsible for his health insurance premiums while he is out of work. This is the reason I’m starting this Go Fund Me. There are many resources out there for cancer patients  but I want to try to utilize all our options. The love and support we’ve received from friends and family in the last 11 days has been overwhelming and I couldn’t be more grateful. If you have the means and can find it in your heart to send us a financial gift  it will just be one more thing we are thankful for."

He was on a ventilator and medically induced coma for weeks. Though he can breathe on his own now  he's still having difficulty using one side of his body  swallowing  and speaking. He has a PEG tube into his stomach for feedings  and is completely dependent on other people caring for him. All prognoses were that he would die  but yet he's fought to stay here. I believe this is for me  our young son Umair who is only 6 years old  and his family.We are now in a dire situation.  No rehabilitation center will accept him as he has no way of paying for medical care or health insurance  and Medicaid will take up to 30-60 days to kick in  if it does. Our apartment lease is up soon in February  and no one is willing to give me an apartment as I have no job nor income. I've had to quit my job at starbucks to be Roushan's caretaker full time. Though our family and extended family is trying their best to help us  we can't manage the thousands in medical bills  housing  and long term care we're facing.

My name is Dan Cottrell  and I wish I was introducing myself for a happier reason. We all are bound together because we know a very special person. Michael Jerryson. Our brother  mentor  teacher  colleuge  co-conspirator  and friend. Michael was recently diagnosed with a genetic version of ALS-  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS is a disease in which you begin to lose control of the muscles in your body. Eventually  you are unable to swallow water - and breathe for yourself. In addition to this physical problem  20-30% of the victims suffer from forms of dementia. Since Michael has the C9orf72 genetic form of ALS  he has an over 70% chance of developing cognitive impairments. The rate of physical decline will be aggressive. Time frames range from 20+ years to less than a year; it is hard to chart.While Michael does have health insurance  he and his family have accrued significant medical expenses since his diagnosis. There have been tests too numerous to mention  and lots of hospital visits. Prescription medications  missed work for both Michael and Fawn  and endless trips to the Cleveland clinic. Michael’s future holds more of the same  and as we all know  there are co-pays  deductibles  services  and endless other fees that slip through the loose net of health insurance. While Michael is still working  and Youngstown State is supporting him incredibly well  it is likely that expenses will continue to mount.I met Michael (he was Mike back then)  way back in 1989  when we shared a Sophomore English class in high school. I knew even then that Mike was an exceptional (and unique) person. Like all of you I’m guessing  I’m inspired regularly by Michael’s loyalty  intelligence  humor  and idealism  not to mention the infectious laugh and smile. For nearly three decades Michael has driven me to be a better person and given me so much as a friend and brother. I can only hope to give Michael a fraction of that back in love  time and support for him and his family during this incredibly challenging time. I am hoping we can raise $20 000 through this campaign to assist Michael and his family. However  I am hoping we can all make an additional donation  perhaps a more valuable one then money. Time. Michael has expressed that one of his most cherished possessions is time spent with the people he loves and cares for. Drop him a note or a text  or even better an old school phone call. Talk to him about the things you share and are passionate about. Laugh about something! Let’s all raise some money  but let’s also raise Michael’s spirits and remind him why we each love and cherish him as much as I know we all do! Love and thanks. Dan"
"Medical","March 2, 2019","Help Support The Friedrich Children","$11,162","$80,000","56","1","56","123","CHICAGO","IL","To all my friends and family.  My friends  Jay and Kristen  have two beautiful children  William and Evelyn  that have some medical issues.  I have known Jay and Kristen for many years  and they both have been wonderful friends.  He is an IT manager and Kristen is a stay at home mom taking care of her special needs children.  They are wonderful parents and good friends. Their childrens' issues have not all been covered by insurance  resulting in over $100 000 in medical bills and debt for their family. The Friedrich family needs support in their time of need. While pregnant with their daughter  Evelyn  they discovered she had Congenital Hydrocephalus and doctors told them she would likely not make it to birth. She proved to be a strong fighter and they got to meet their wonderful baby girl.Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within cavities in the brain called ventricles. It occurs when there is an imbalance between the amount of CSF that is produced and the rate at which it is absorbed. As the CSF builds up  it causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase.Sadly  her struggle was only beginning. By seven months old  she needed to be rushed into emergency pediatric neurosurgery to install a cerebral shunt to relieve the pressure on her brain. She also developed very serious seizures and had to be put on a costly ($2700/month) medicine that  while it could result in permanent damage her eyesight  would bring the seizures under control over the course of several months. Those seizures and the hydrocephalus led to Evelyn developing Quadriplegic Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Hypotonia is diminished muscle tone. Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy is often the result of severe brain damage or malformations and is a physical disability that affects movement and posture and can result in complications such as additional seizures and intellectual delays. In Evelyn's case  it means she has less muscle tone in all of her limbs which affects her ability to walk  grasp  and other tasks that rely on motor control or muscle tone. While all that was going on  their young son  William  had stopped talking  stopped eating  and began experiencing chronic pain in his joints. It took them over a year of medical trial and error: speech therapy  feeding clinics  GI surgery  occupational therapy  and others  along with dozens of different doctors and specialist and some rather large medical bills (in the tens of thousands) to get to a diagnosis. William has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and is on the Autism Spectrum. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin  bones  blood vessels  eyes  and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions  which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications; such as easy bruising and scarring  joint dislocation  rupture in major blood vessels and others. There is no cure for EDS  but it can be treated.Doctors also strongly recommend William begin Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment for his autism and leg braces for his EDS. Evelyn requires leg and hand braces for her Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. Both kids have been fighting throughout all of this  and have done amazingly well with treatment. Better than their parents dared to hope for. They’ve been in and out of hospitals the entirety of their young lives: 5 ER visits  6 times being admitted for long term care  3 CT scans  7 MRI’s  4 long-term EEG studies  and 9 series of X-Rays just for baby Evelyn before she was even 18 months old  and William has been to the ER multiple times for dislocations and other issues related to his EDS. Within the near future  Evelyn will also need to undergo another brain surgery for a shunt revision  as she outgrows her current shunt or it fails (they almost always do  sooner or later). After William was diagnosed with Autism they discovered their health insurance would not cover any of his treatment related to his autism  leaving them to pay tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills completely out of pocket.William and Evelyn require treatment several times a week with occupational therapy  speech therapy  and physical therapy. Their mother  Kristen has had to put off returning to work indefinitely to care for their children  as they couldn’t possibly afford to pay for their children’s care if they didn’t take a large portion of it on themselves. They have also had to cease their own healthcare for their own medical issues (they both also have EDS) to keep their medical costs down as much as possible. They are left with a mountain of medical debt and both of their children have a long struggle ahead of them. They need your help! Your donations will be used to help them reduce or pay off their medical debts and get these wonderful and fiercely strong young children access to the treatments and procedures they need to thrive."

My name is Dan Cottrell  and I wish I was introducing myself for a happier reason. We all are bound together because we know a very special person. Michael Jerryson. Our brother  mentor  teacher  colleuge  co-conspirator  and friend. Michael was recently diagnosed with a genetic version of ALS-  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS is a disease in which you begin to lose control of the muscles in your body. Eventually  you are unable to swallow water - and breathe for yourself. In addition to this physical problem  20-30% of the victims suffer from forms of dementia. Since Michael has the C9orf72 genetic form of ALS  he has an over 70% chance of developing cognitive impairments. The rate of physical decline will be aggressive. Time frames range from 20+ years to less than a year; it is hard to chart.While Michael does have health insurance  he and his family have accrued significant medical expenses since his diagnosis. There have been tests too numerous to mention  and lots of hospital visits. Prescription medications  missed work for both Michael and Fawn  and endless trips to the Cleveland clinic. Michael’s future holds more of the same  and as we all know  there are co-pays  deductibles  services  and endless other fees that slip through the loose net of health insurance. While Michael is still working  and Youngstown State is supporting him incredibly well  it is likely that expenses will continue to mount.I met Michael (he was Mike back then)  way back in 1989  when we shared a Sophomore English class in high school. I knew even then that Mike was an exceptional (and unique) person. Like all of you I’m guessing  I’m inspired regularly by Michael’s loyalty  intelligence  humor  and idealism  not to mention the infectious laugh and smile. For nearly three decades Michael has driven me to be a better person and given me so much as a friend and brother. I can only hope to give Michael a fraction of that back in love  time and support for him and his family during this incredibly challenging time. I am hoping we can raise $20 000 through this campaign to assist Michael and his family. However  I am hoping we can all make an additional donation  perhaps a more valuable one then money. Time. Michael has expressed that one of his most cherished possessions is time spent with the people he loves and cares for. Drop him a note or a text  or even better an old school phone call. Talk to him about the things you share and are passionate about. Laugh about something! Let’s all raise some money  but let’s also raise Michael’s spirits and remind him why we each love and cherish him as much as I know we all do! Love and thanks. Dan"

Their childrens' issues have not all been covered by insurance  resulting in over $100 000 in medical bills and debt for their family. The Friedrich family needs support in their time of need. While pregnant with their daughter  Evelyn  they discovered she had Congenital Hydrocephalus and doctors told them she would likely not make it to birth. She proved to be a strong fighter and they got to meet their wonderful baby girl.Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within cavities in the brain called ventricles. It occurs when there is an imbalance between the amount of CSF that is produced and the rate at which it is absorbed. As the CSF builds up  it causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase.Sadly  her struggle was only beginning. By seven months old  she needed to be rushed into emergency pediatric neurosurgery to install a cerebral shunt to relieve the pressure on her brain. She also developed very serious seizures and had to be put on a costly ($2700/month) medicine that  while it could result in permanent damage her eyesight  would bring the seizures under control over the course of several months. Those seizures and the hydrocephalus led to Evelyn developing Quadriplegic Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Hypotonia is diminished muscle tone. Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy is often the result of severe brain damage or malformations and is a physical disability that affects movement and posture and can result in complications such as additional seizures and intellectual delays. In Evelyn's case  it means she has less muscle tone in all of her limbs which affects her ability to walk  grasp  and other tasks that rely on motor control or muscle tone. While all that was going on  their young son  William  had stopped talking  stopped eating  and began experiencing chronic pain in his joints. It took them over a year of medical trial and error: speech therapy  feeding clinics  GI surgery  occupational therapy  and others  along with dozens of different doctors and specialist and some rather large medical bills (in the tens of thousands) to get to a diagnosis. William has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and is on the Autism Spectrum. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin  bones  blood vessels  eyes  and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions  which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications; such as easy bruising and scarring  joint dislocation  rupture in major blood vessels and others. There is no cure for EDS  but it can be treated.Doctors also strongly recommend William begin Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment for his autism and leg braces for his EDS. Evelyn requires leg and hand braces for her Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. Both kids have been fighting throughout all of this  and have done amazingly well with treatment. Better than their parents dared to hope for. They’ve been in and out of hospitals the entirety of their young lives: 5 ER visits  6 times being admitted for long term care  3 CT scans  7 MRI’s  4 long-term EEG studies  and 9 series of X-Rays just for baby Evelyn before she was even 18 months old  and William has been to the ER multiple times for dislocations and other issues related to his EDS. Within the near future  Evelyn will also need to undergo another brain surgery for a shunt revision  as she outgrows her current shunt or it fails (they almost always do  sooner or later). After William was diagnosed with Autism they discovered their health insurance would not cover any of his treatment related to his autism  leaving them to pay tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills completely out of pocket.William and Evelyn require treatment several times a week with occupational therapy  speech therapy  and physical therapy. Their mother  Kristen has had to put off returning to work indefinitely to care for their children  as they couldn’t possibly afford to pay for their children’s care if they didn’t take a large portion of it on themselves. They have also had to cease their own healthcare for their own medical issues (they both also have EDS) to keep their medical costs down as much as possible. They are left with a mountain of medical debt and both of their children have a long struggle ahead of them. They need your help! Your donations will be used to help them reduce or pay off their medical debts and get these wonderful and fiercely strong young children access to the treatments and procedures they need to thrive."

It is listed under the National Organization of Rare Diseases and around 10-15 new cases out of a million are diagnosed each year.Most patients don't \"look sick\" but depending on the severity at diagnosis  life expectancy without successful treatment to slow progression is 3-5 years.Diagnosed in December of 2016  Genevieve is currently being treated but the disease is progressing and she is now being referred to the Duke Medical Center in Durham  NC for transplant.Having \"Idiopathic\" pulmonary arterial hypertension makes it a Class I form of the disease and very difficult to treat due to its unknown cause. The current treatment requires medications that need to be shipped from a specialty pharmacy. Patients are instructed by specialty trained nurses on how to administer and monitor IV meds and medication dosing.These medications are extremely sensitive and can be life-threatening if interrupted. Monthly co-pays can run anywhere from $400-$690.00 not to include frequent hospitalizations  therapies and doctor visits.For a family of 6  preparing to have to finance such an undertaking of relocating to another state  maintain the home and family in VA (to include two younger children) is both an emotional and financial hardship.The estimated cost for this procedure (barring any complications) is well over $2.5 million dollars. Even with quality health insurance  this is just an estimate and does not reflect the costs for additional pulmonary and physical therapies  immunosuppressant drugs and repeated trips to Durham for follow up when discharged.Financial guidance provided by the Duke Medical Center recommends that patients come prepared with at least $10 000 to assist with the cost of relocating to Durham  North Carolina  and living expenses (for both patient and their caregiver(s) during the time that they are required to reside at Duke and for 6 months to a year following transplant.Typically  the wait for a donor organ could be as soon as 15 days (for 1 organ) or 1 - 2 years depending upon tissue and blood match and availability of organs. Costs incurred are for room and board  prescriptions  transportation  and basic living essentials.Once the initial evaluation is completed  and a patient is accepted into the program  they may be expected to relocate immediately or within 3-6 months.For those of you who wish to journey with Genevieve and her family while they prepare for a lifesaving surgery  we will provide a link to her Caring Bridge Medical Journal upon receipt of any donation.If you can find it in your hear to support “Team Genevieve” by making a donation and then sharing with your network we would be forever so grateful.

She would eat some crackers or a few bites of a sandwich  then she'd start feeling full. She started losing weight and was fatigued  but she still kept babysitting her grandbaby whenever she was needed  and spent many of her weekends driving to Bryan  three hours away  to spend time with her widowed mother. All the while  she was feeling ill  but like a mama bear  our Mom is reluctant to let on when she's unwell. Finally  in August 2018  even Mom's iron will started to fade  and she began seeking treatment. For months  doctors prodded her. They ordered invasive and expensive tests  but couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally  the Friday before Thanksgiving  she went to the emergency room in excruciating pain. The doctors performed a laparoscopy  and when she awoke from the anesthesia  they told her the news no one wants to hear: \"It's cancer  and it's everywhere.\"Maribelle has a very rare form of cancer that strikes only one in a million: mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix. In a cruel twist  she had her appendix removed in 2007  which means this cancer has been growing in her abdomen  undetected  for 11 years. Hundreds of  tumors now encase most of the organs in her belly—her large intestine  gallbladder  spleen  liver and perhaps more.(Images from Maribelle's laparoscopy)Fifteen years ago  this diagnosis would have been a death sentence. This cancer  which is part of a group of cancers called peritoneal cancer  does not typically respond to traditional chemotherapy. But in the early 2000s  a new treatment called Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy  or HIPEC  began extending the lives of patients by as much as 10+ years.HIPEC will be one of the biggest trials of Maribelle's life. The surgery itself can last up to 16 hours  as surgeons remove any expendable organs and painstakingly excise tumors from what remains  then bathe the abdominal cavity in heated  high-intensity chemotherapy drugs for two hours. When the surgery is over  Maribelle will spend several days in the ICU  stay in the hospital for at least two weeks  and will be out of work for several more as her body recovers. The scar will run the length of her abdomen  from her sternum to her pelvis  and it may be six months to a year before she's fully recovered.Learn more about HIPEC here Maribelle has weathered a lot in her life. As a single working mom  she singlehandedly raised two children and two stepchildren. (That’s one mom and FOUR kids!) During the recession of 2008  she was unexpectedly laid off from her employer of 20+ years  and she went back to school to create a new career for herself in her 50s. Now  Maribelle is too young for Medicare but finds herself facing a daunting medical emergency. Although she has a good job and health insurance  she will be taking a great deal of unpaid time off  and she’ll be  reaching her maximum out-of-pocket limit twice  once for treatment in 2018 and again for 2019.  Your donations will go directly to her hospital fees and other necessary expenses.Fortunately  Maribelle has three things on her side:(Dr Patricio Polanco)1) A great surgical team. We're fortunate to be working with Dr Polanco at UT Southwestern. He is an experienced provider of HIPEC  and we are confident he and his team will give Maribelle the best care in Texas.(Maribelle and grandson Tom)2) A great attitude. If you've met Maribelle  you know she is 100% a  steel magnolia. She's loving and warm  but also highly determined. She  would do anything for her family.  She has four young grandchildren and another due this spring  and Maribelle is not going to let anything get in the way of playing with her precious grandbabies.3) Loving friends and family. Maribelle comes from a family that's as tight-knit as they come  and is surrounded by friends and a church community who are ready to help her through this difficult time. We are already planning to spend weeks of our own time off—paid and unpaid—helping Mom as she heals. She will initially need assistance with all the small tasks of everyday life—dressing  bathing  etc—and will require a special diet for many months. For this reason  she won't be needing meals  but if you'd like to find another way to help her  please send us a message. It's likely she will be needing help with driving  errands  lifting and other tasks for months after the surgery. Thank you again for your help. Together we can get through this difficult moment and help the woman who's given so much  so lovingly  to so many."

In December 2018  she was diagnosed with Stage 2 metastatic breast cancer. In January 2019  Sara had a mastectomy and several lymph nodes removed. Due to the discovery of additional cancer  she underwent a second surgery four weeks later to remove 20 more lymph nodes. In February  her cancer was reclassified as Stage 3. She is currently undergoing three months of chemotherapy after which she’ll begin five to six weeks of daily radiation treatments. Hormone therapy will become a part of her life for the next five to ten years after that. About SaraSara lives in Rochester  NY  and is employed as the Senior Director of Programs at a local museum. She is a single mother of two awesome children – Dylan  who is on his own  living nearby in Penfield  and Lydia  who lives at home  works at a cafe  and is finishing her freshman year at Monroe Community College. Sara always strives to maintain a positive attitude about life. Knowing her strength and determination  I am confident she will surmount both the significant physical and emotional challenges that lie ahead – especially with the help and support of her team of doctors  family members  and friends. Financial challenges for Sara also lie ahead. She has health insurance through her employer  but the plan’s very high deductible and ongoing uncovered medical bills for this year will require at least $7 000. The much bigger financial challenge for Sara will be due to the loss of income. Since her diagnosis  she has been able to use paid sick leave and paid vacation days to get through the recent surgeries. Her chemotherapy and radiation treatments  as well as recovery from these treatments  will require a much greater amount of time. Sara will be required to take three to four months of unpaid time off work  resulting in a loss of income – income needed to pay rent  pay monthly bills  support her daughter  and cover day-to-day expenses. These financial burdens will be a source of ongoing stress during this time of already overwhelming anxiety. How can we help Sara?The doctors and specialists are helping Sara from the medical aspect. Family members  friends  and support agencies are providing Sara the needed emotional support. What is left is tackling the financial challenges during her treatment  which will  in turn  help prevent the anxiety that goes with them.If Sara is free of stress related to income loss and uncovered medical expenses  she will be able to focus her energies on healing  maintaining a positive spirit  and taking the best care of herself that she can – something that could prove critical for her recovery.

My name is Allison and my sister  Cara  and I are writing this for our mom  Beth  who is undergoing a thoracic aortic replacement surgery with limited health insurance and no disability coverage through her job. This is a critical  life saving open-heart surgery that will require all of her strength to be focused on her long road to recovery. As a result  she is struggling to find peace because she is unable to cover all the expenses related to this surgery due to her circumstances. My mom and I have Marfan Syndrome  a genetic disease that weakens the connective tissue  which happens to be the glue that holds the body together. This condition makes my mom vulnerable to connective tissue tears  or dissections  which is how we ended up here. 20 years ago  my mom had her first aortic replacement surgery on her ascending aorta which was successful. We hoped that that was the only open-heart surgery she would need in her lifetime. We had a scare 10 years ago when she experienced her first aortic dissection. I’ll never forget the day I woke up and walked into my mom’s room to find her sitting on the end of her bed clutching her chest  unable to breathe. Cara helped me back to my room and told me to stay there until she said everything was ok. I was 12  and I couldn’t stop thinking that this might be the last time I ever saw my mom. All I could think in that moment was that my grandmother  my mom’s mom who also had Marfan Syndrome  and had passed away from an aortic dissection when my mom was only 10  not much younger than I was at the time. It was terrifying. Fortunately  my mom knew she had Marfan’s and was able to be an advocate for herself in the hospital. After telling my mom she was simply having back pain and making her wait in the emergency room for hours untreated  she essentially educated the doctors on her condition and convinced them she was having a dissection and to get her the correct treatment right away.In 2008 when the market crashed my mom lost her job  at which point she decided to go back to school to become a nurse. She wanted to help people heal in the same way her nurses had helped her. My mom has ALWAYS put others first  often forsaking her own health or happiness to make sure others are taken care of. As a nurse  she works with geriatric patients during the day while also picking up shifts at a hospital working with patients recovering from substance abuse. My mom has so much love to give  she is a gentle and kind spirit who wants nothing more than to help others and see them happy. She’s helped so many people  and now it’s our turn to help her. My parents divorced when I was 10 and I so admire my mom for raising two daughters while keeping our lives as close to normal as possible. However  my mother has been accumulating medical bills for her and myself as there are a limited number of doctors specializing in Marfan Syndrome.Fortunately  we’ve found one of the best surgeons to do our mom's surgery  but this quality of care comes with a very high cost. My mom is also concerned about termination at her job because she is not eligible for FMLA protection having been there for less than a year. We are asking for help to pay for my mom’s surgery  medical bills from the hospital  and general everyday things while she is out of work and will not be earning any income. My mom already works 2 jobs to pay her bills — and with this lack of income  I’m afraid she will push herself to go back to work before she’s fully healed. Our greatest wish is that we can help alleviate some of the financial burden we know she is facing. We would like to see her go through her recovery without the added stress of wondering how she will be able to pay for the basics like food and shelter. We ask you to please help if you can  we greatly appreciate anythingyou may be able to give at this time  and we would also greatly appreciate you helping to share our mom’s story. This is major surgery and it is terrifying for me and my sister. We are trying to help my mom in any way we know how  and we would be incredibly appreciative of any help you can give."

She is a wonderful and caring mother to her 5 year old son and a loving wife. Well  this time Nevena needs our help  our support and generosity. She needs us in the hardest of times  as she is battling breast cancer. Nevena was diagnosed with triple-negative  pretty invasive and fast developing breast cancer and had to start treatments immediately after her diagnosis  during a time when she had NO health insurance coverage. This diagnosis came at the worst of times  right before the holidays. Needless to say  the cost of treatments  scans  test and medications are in the thousands by now (over $20 000 at this time) and are all out of pocket expense. And this is just the beginning. She needs to go through 5 more rounds of chemo  followed by a surgery and possibly radiation. It has become quite overwhelming for her and her family and the bills just keep coming in. Please consider any donation amount  so we can help Nevena and ease her worries  because the last thing someone needs during their fight with cancer is worrying about medical bills.  I know she has touched the hearts of many people over the years and I hope everyone finds it in their hearts to give back.

They are exemplary  hard-working  God-loving people  the likes of which we should all strive to emulate. Unfortunately in this world  disease does not discriminate  nor does it care what kind of remarkable life we lead.  We are left to struggle the best we can while still caring for our family.   Marcia faces a dire health challenge  but she and her family hold out hope for a life-saving diagnosis and treatment. A small sacrifice from us can keep their hopes alive.Marcia was an avid athlete who enjoyed running  cycling  hiking  and thrived on fitness. As a physical therapist  she healed others who were suffering from pain. In the last nine months she has suffered from a puzzling condition that has caused chest and abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  inability to eat and overwhelming fatigue. Multiple visits to physicians at Scripps and UCSD and dozens of tests have shed no light on the cause. Marcia has lost weight (down to 76 lbs!) and is losing strength daily. She can no longer work or care for her young children. Because of their reduced income  her teenage daughter will work to help pay the family household expenses. Their next (and maybe last) option is the Mayo Clinic  which is not covered under their health insurance. We need your prayers  your ideas for a diagnosis  and we need financial assistance to help medical experts find life-saving answers. Any amount would be a tremendous help to a wonderful family trying to live through devastating circumstances.  We're not social media experts so if you can also help spread the word to your circle of family and friends through sharing on Facebook or Twitter  please click on those logos below.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts and God Bless you.Andy and Rusty's Thursday morning Cursillo brothers."

Now it is stage 4 and was told her life would be drastically cut short. After 2 months of being on a trial drug  it became apparent this was not the quality of life she wants to have. Immunotherapy is the next option which is  unfortunately not covered under health insurance. Joann is someone with a big heart and always willing to help others. She has a strong work ethic. After working at the Santa Rosa Junior College for 26 years  she is well loved by the students  faculty and staff members. In December 2018 she will officially be retired. JoAnn is a devoted mother of 4 and grandmother of 5. Being a single parent raising 4 kids on her own  she taught us the value of family and the importance of being there for each other. The rock of our family  she is always positive  supportive and encouraging.  She never complains even in the most difficult or painful of times. As one of Jehovah's Witnesses she relies on her faith to keep her strong.Many people have inquired how they can help financially so  we have decided to put up a go fund me account to help with her treatments and quality of life.

One to remove broken discs and then another to do corrective surgery  after a car accident he was in damaged the previous surgical area . The current situation is that these discs pressed and pinched on Larry's spinal root nerves for too long a time and now these nerves are damaged and slowly deteriorating. Without treatment  Larry could lose his ability to do normal everyday functions and even his ability to walk eventually. Larry is a gifted pianist and composer. Without treatment  he would lose the ability to play the piano or any musical instrument  which is his lifelong work and livelihood. The treatment for his nerve damage involves a relatively new approach called Stem Cell Therapy.  Stem cell therapy for nerve damage is surprisingly straightforward. Stem cells are collected from your own blood  bone marrow  or from your fat tissue. Once the stem cells are recovered  they are then injected into specific locations where they adapt to heal damaged tissue. Results may not show immediately  but once the cells get to work  the healing process begins. Stem cells are key to unlocking your body’s ability to heal itself. Broadly speaking  adult stem cells are what is known as undifferentiated (meaning that they are not permanently locked into a specific kind of cell)  and can become other kinds of cellular tissue that can be used to repair damaged or diseased areas  such as damaged nerves  as needed.How is this possible? You can think of adult stem cells as living  universal building blocks. As such  they can be activated  multiplying into many other kinds of cells  including nerve cells. This means that tissue may be able to regenerate  and heal in ways once thought to be impossible. The longer Larry waits for this treatment  the worse his condition will get and lessen his chances for full healing.Larry's health insurance is bare minimal and does not cover this kind of treatment. He is experiencing great pain and suffering 24/7. These treatments are crucial for Larry in order to relieve the disabling pain that is spreading throughout his body and to restore his life and his music back to him! Many of you already know  Larry and his beautiful music. For those of you who don't  here is a video of his work to help you get a feel for Larry and his heart."

The whole process was a bit scary for all involved but whenever Kristy and I needed some encouragement all we had to do was turn to William who throughout the whole process was amazingly strong! Truly a SUPERHERO! The journey is not over as now we work with the oncology TEAM at Children's to decide on the next course of action. High Grade Gliomas are the most aggressive and difficult forms of cancer to treat but we have options (both FDA approved and Trials) and we will be praying that WE WILL BEAT THIS!  The final week of radiation is upon us and William has been a Superhero throughout!. Well actually we don't end until April 15th but who's counting. Spent the weekend hunting Golden Rainbow trout in WV but only came away with one GIANT Rainbow. Good catch. Followed this up with some NCAA basketball but even though MSU didn't come away with a win it was a great season. Ending the weekend with a brunch hosted by buds from #letmerun. Thanks Alfonso! and some more fishing of course!Thanks to all those who have supported us in so many ways. Jerry and Kristy. I (Deb Levy) have added Gerald (Jerry) Hovis as the beneficiary of this campaign. As you all know  Jerry is the father of William Hovis who is undergoing treatments for brain cancer.  This note is a transparency requirement of the GoFundMe Organization. Thanks.As many of you know  William Hovis had a brain tumor removed on Jan. 29  2019  and he is now undergoing six weeks of radiation treatment and will most likely be followed by chemotherapy. Even with Kristy and Jerry's health insurance  they are sure to incur significant out of pocket costs. This is going to be a long battle. Any support that loved ones can give will help William get the proper care he needs to heal. If you've met William you are really lucky  if you haven't yet met him you will love him when you do!

Make your donation  and complete the order form below. -------------------------------------- While most people were getting ready for Thanksgiving and for Christmas this year  Nikolaos “Nikos” Safos who is 40 years young  found himself in the emergency room at the Hampton Veteran’s Affairs.  After a long 2 days of poking and prodding  the tests confirmed colorectal cancer  a diagnosis usually reserved for much older patients.   For Nikos and his family this news was absolutely devastating.  He has been married for 5 years to Jena  and they have 3 children (1yo  3yo  and a 10yo). Nikos has spent over twenty years serving others and the last almost 3 years  working as a hospice chaplain helping others.  Nikos is a wonderful provider  giver and servant to our community.  Please join us on this journey to fight against cancer! How It Began…In the early part of summer  Nikos didn’t quite feel like his normal self  something just wasn’t quite right  he could sense it. However  he didn’t have health insurance to go get his symptoms checkout. In July Nikos was digging a 4 foot hole in his backyard  but he was having a very difficult time at this task. His heart was racing  he was sweating profusely  and it just seemed like this hole was never going to get dug. As the summer went on  he became weaker and weaker. Several times during the summer and fall  he saw blood in his stool  his appetite decreased  he was a tad grumpy  he had to pull over while driving around time to nap  and he wasn’t sleeping. His wife  Jena  was worried  so she applied for Medicaid  it was denied. Then in October Jena received an email from the VA  stating that any veteran could apply for VA Healthcare. That very day  she applied for health benefits for Nikos. It was about 4 weeks later  they found out Nikos finally had healthcare coverage.  Two weeks before Christmas  Nikos was very pale  could barely walk a few steps without his heart feeling like it was going to explode  could not go up a flight of stairs  and was always short of breath. His wife asked him to go to the ER  just in case he was having a heart attack. He got to the ER  they sent him straight back to run the EKG and the Stress Test  both came back negative. About an hour after being there  the blood work came back  his hemoglobin was a 4 out of 15 and his iron levels were below a 1. There was a leak; somewhere in his body was a leak! Finally we have some answers.  The next step now  was to find the leak. Turns out  no leak…after 4 blood transfusions  2 iron transfusions  and 4 days in the hospital being poked  scanned  analyzed and prodded  the doctors confirmed that Nikos has Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer that has metastasize to the right lobe of his liver  and into his colon lymph nodes.  Nikos has recieved 1 cycle of Avastin and Eloxatin intravenously  and takes Xeloda orally every day  this regiment will continue for a 6-week period. After this period  he will go back out to the VA for a follow up PET scan. The results of this scan; will indicate how they should move forward in the treatment plan.  Funds raised through this campaign will be used for: Medical expensesSuper Fighting Cancer FoodsTravel to Drug TrialsLost wages from being sick T-shirt Order Form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqEAisedE3zt0r0Q2ldiceM1RAQMgyAjHCE7kUbfNYwZ6U5g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1"

We thankfully have everything under one roof including agenda  doctor and treatment coordination.  We had two options given to us and we chose to go with daily radiation and weekly chemotherapy.  She also has a GTube for her food  which feeds and hydrates her directly into her stomach for nourishment. As a Western Regional Business Development Manager  my US territory spans from Mississippi to Hawaii. Most of my work involves travel across multiple States.  Marijke was let go at the end of November 2018 and at present I’m the sole income provider for the family. We fortunately have health insurance for both of us through my company.  If you aren’t from the US  one of the interesting things about health insurance in the US is the insurance picks up about 70% of the costs while the rest is out of pocket.  After two months of treatment  we have maxed our yearly deductible  and our initial personal invoices are due soon! My mom thankfully was able to fly in from Europe in February. With her help we’ve been able to coordinate daily schedules between my mom  Axel ( our son) and myself when local and available. Her 6-week stay is about to come to an end  and we face some new needs. At present we are in search of a care giver (preferably a great looking guy  Marijke’s request) to help with daily liquid feedings  washing  cleaning and cooking tasks.  As well  this person will take Marijke’s to her daily doctor visits.  Unfortunately  this type of help falls outside the realms of what health insurance will cover.  We are looking to raise $15000+ to help pay for these unexpected needs. You are receiving this note as you have been a part of our story. We are so thankful for the role you have played in our lives up to this point.  We truly appreciate all of your prayers and any way you are able to help us during Marijke’s difficult time.  As well  Marijke and I would love to hear from you.  The best way to connect  with Marijke Adam (Yes  Europeans keep their last name even when married) is via messenger   facebook or Text.You are always welcome to visit her personally  actually she seems to flourish seeing friends. Please donate & share  Thank You ALL!P.S.

"Medical","October 23, 2018","Dr. Todd Nelson&apos;s Cancer Fund","$10,481","$12,000","57","5","54","222","LOUISVILLE","CO","I grew up eating brussels sprouts and carob  taking vitamins and homeopathics when I got sick. As an adult  I find myself checking the ingredients on everything before I buy it  shoving vitamins and green leafy vegetables down my son's throat  and loading up on Chinese herbs before winter. One of the most deep-rooted values instilled in my being is Health - and I have my dad  a Naturopath  to thank for that. My father is a healer through and through. He has spent his adult life caring for others  healing others  coaching others  and spreading optimism. He is always available to help people with their questions and ailments  always researching the newest health trends and technologies. He is the healthiest person I know. Unfortunately genetics are powerful  and they had other plans for him.  This has been the most difficult year for him health-wise  especially with this new curve ball the universe has thrown at us. Todd  was diagnosed with HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma cancer in his left tonsil in early October. The tumor is 4 cm and has caused an ulceration making it hard to eat and talk for very long. I never EVER thought I would say \"cancer\" and my dad's name in the same sentence  but here we are and my dad is persevering  with grace  patience  and integrity. The good news is  there is a high success rate for beating this type of cancer with radiation treatment! This entails 33 daily treatments  in a row  which will require my dad to be home from work for 4 weeks.  We can expect severe fatigue  throat pain  radiation site pain  and the likelihood of a feeding tube. The doctor told us that keeping weight on will be a big goal and Todd will likely need to undergo speech therapy as the vocal chords will be affected. The radiation treatment will cost around $8-9 000 out-of-pocket before insurance fully kicks in. He already pays $8  760 in premiums even before paying the deductible  not to mention it all starts over in January. Don't get me started on health insurance in this country!! In conjunction  my dad will also be doing alternative therapies/supports and supplements to compliment the radiation therapy. The estimated cost of these therapies is $1 000- 1500 a month for at least 6 months.As many of you know  my dad is already living with 2 genetic illnesses that are slowly progressive and have rendered him partially disabled. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and a form of neuropathy called Charco-Marie-Tooth 2 (CMT-2). Here’s a link describing each illness:  https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/    https://www.cmtausa.org/understanding-cmt/what-is-cmt/Everything Todd is dealing with has made it very difficult  and at times impossible  to continue to market his practice and because of that his business has been significantly slower. So please consider donating what you can and pass this link (and the word) along to friends and family!"

She has a heart of gold  never judges anyone  and is always the first in line when someone needs help. She has become a sister to me over the years and it is so hard to watch what she has gone through and is going through while being a young mother  during a time which is supposed to be the best years of your life. Katja never asks for help and is a very private person. I did ask her for permission or better lovingly forced her to give me permission to do this for her. Please consider giving whatever you can.

If you can  help before January 2019!!Our dear Maggie (Mona) Hall has been dealing with colon cancer for over 3 years now. It has not been easy by any means  but she has kept working  her personal strength is stunning. The day after Thanksgiving she found out the cancer had become Chemo resistant  and the tumor has grown back to the size it was at diagnosis. She is now on leave from work and she & Nick will be moving into an apartment in our (her parents’) building ASAP. That unit becomes vacant Dec 26th. The timing is horrible I know. Here is why we are asking for your help: 1) Movers run about $2000 - Maggie & Nick’s current apartment is on the third floor with no elevator  there is no way to do it without professionals given the volume of stuff they have. We need to be out of that apartment by Jan 1st. Packing help is wanted too! 2) Budgeting $1000 for a second opinion consult with Dr. Lentz at USC  one of the leading doctors in the world for colorectal cancer  plus any tests he needs to run. Because Maggie has Kaiser insurance and Dr. Lentz is non-Kaiser  it needs to be paid out of pocket. We are hoping future treatment there will be covered by Kaiser but that's iffy. 3) Rental on a storage unit for 6 months  $1000. Since they will be downsizing from a 2-bedroom to a one-bedroom  they’ll need to store their extra stuff; this will be about $160 per month for at least 6 months while we find new homes for some very cool stuff. and 4) Other annoying expenses like health insurance (HAH!)  may be asked for in the future as a tier 2 request  but right now we need $4000 minimum to get things started.So  anyway the main thing is: Maggie needs more support than we can swing right now. If you have the ability to help out either with physical labor packing things up or with donations to help make this move & immediate medical care affordable  we would all be so appreciative.  Maggie is our treasure & she probably is special to you as well. We hate asking for help like this   but time is short & this is vital stuff. Please help if you can.

Through it all  she's remained positive  loving  an incredible mom  and one of the strongest people any of us know. She rarely asks for help (and doesn't even want to ask for it now)  but now is the time she needs her friends and family to help her most. Recently  Harper found a lump in her breast. This resulted in a a bi-lateral lumpectomy surgery  and she was diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast Cancer. Her next course of action is 6 weeks of radiation. She's feeling very positive  but still has a long road ahead.Unfortunately  most of the tests and labs were done before her new health insurance kicked in. Which has resulted in a pretty big hospital tab. Additionally  her new insurance does not cover her entire surgery/radiation and will need to pay a decent amount out of pocket. And she'll need to start making these payments soon. Helping Harper will assist her in paying her hospital bills  but also child care. She's still new to Philly and doesn't have the same network she had in Charleston (yet)  so she'll need childcare/extra helping hands while she's recovering and going through treatment. I know most of us wish we could figure out a way to help her through this. Right now  this is one of the best ways to help her. It will truly help ease her stress about money  bills  childcare and get back to a sense of normalcy for her and Ever. Update: It says this campaign benefits Mary Poe. Harper's first name is \"Mary\"  just in case you didn't know aka it's going to the right person."

"Medical","February 23, 2019","Prayers for Pete","$9,833","$25,000","111","1","111","450","SEVERNAPARK","MD","While getting this fundraiser started for Pete I asked him to give me a little autobiography about the journey he has been on so far. Quickly  I realized being the modest guy he is  I was going to have to tell it from my perspective to ensure everyone knew what really was going on here.     I have grown extremely close with Pete over the past year  close enough to consider him a brother. As we always gain joy by seeing our family members and loved ones succeed in life  nothing takes away more joy than watching a loved one suffer. This past year I have watched Pete’s health and well being deteriorate dramatically and his suffering grow exponentially. Pete is one of the strongest people I have ever met in my life and I truly  without a doubt believe that if anyone else were in his shoes  they wouldn't be alive today.    Throughout his life  Pete has dealt with many health complications ranging from odd symptoms to many bizarre surgeries. It wasn't until 7 years ago that it started becoming debilitating to his lifestyle. He contracted mono in the spring of his senior year of high school  which is common for most  but it was just the beginning of something much worse. He started becoming sick more frequently and severely as the months went on until he was hospitalized that fall during his freshman season of college soccer which caused him to miss most of his season.   Over the next 3 years  he suffered many more bouts of sickness and chronic symptoms but always seemed to recover enough to try to live a normal life. It was not until January 2016 where he became extremely ill. This caused him to miss several weeks of college classes and soccer games on multiple occasions over the next two years. Struggling to keep his grades up and play a college sport  he sought out some of the best doctors; bouncing around between the best at Johns Hopkins. Even with the care of the experts  his symptoms got worse. He had every test and scan they could think of with no avail. He was eventually diagnosed with an \"unknown autoimmune disease\" and told there was nothing they could do.    Despite being told that there was nothing even Johns Hopkins could do for him  he never gave up. After graduating college  he still strived to become a professional soccer player. After earning a tryout at a professional team in Sweden  his dreams were cut short as this sickness became even worse. He had to turn down the opportunity and with it  his dream of playing professional soccer. He had to stop working and put his life on pause as the illness began to take over.     After spending 6 long weeks bed ridden  he was finally healthy enough to try to begin getting his life together. Our paths crossed when he started working at Rockwell Fitness in January 2018.  We immediately became best friends  bonding over our love of fitness  helping others  and everything adventurous. That spring we began working out together  running mountains together  and trekking through blizzards across snow capped mountains together. We even managed to have the opportunity to compete in a Qualifier for a World Championship Obstacle Course Race. As a justification for the amount of fight in this kid  he broke his leg from a bad fall around mile 13 but still ran another 22 miles and completed another 50 some obstacles to qualify for Worlds. Depressingly enough  he would never have the chance to compete at Worlds.  While we always had the time of our lives on these crazy adventures  there was one thing I slowly started to notice. Pete was fighting an internal battle behind the scenes. He would miss a day here or there and always bounce back  but his health slowly started deteriorating again. It began to slip even further over the following months  being hospitalized several times with no cure available to him.    It is one of the most soul crushing feelings to watch one of the strongest people you know and care about face endless suffering with no end to the madness. As of right now  Pete's autoimmune disease has kept him from working out or exercising for the past 8 months. He has a very restricted diet of just cooked vegetables and fish  as that is all his body can handle. He has had an infection in his hand for over a year and a half that cannot be cured due to his autoimmune disease  which renders him unable to take antibiotics. He can't even fly or travel due to his disease. He is forced to spend most of his time home in bed  only fighting to come in to work for a few hours at a time.   However  there has been a glimpse of hope. Pete was able to make an appointment with one of the most world renowned doctors and patiently waited 3 months to be seen by him. He has given light to what could be causing all of this suffering for Pete. The doctor is sure it is a very severe  strand of lymes disease that is the root cause of all the autoimmune issues. He has drawn out a plan of treatment  but warned Pete that is going to be a very rough 6 months ahead of him  informing him he will most likely not be able to work and will be bed ridden for periods of time. Yet most importantly  he will be cured of all of this.     Although  this promise of a cure brings about more problems as these treatments are very expensive and Pete will be turning 26 in two months and will no longer be on his parents’ health insurance. Not many 26 year olds have the means to go weeks without work either. Pete just as always plans to fight through the misery and keep working as much as he can. Yet this will only draw this suffering out longer. I have already told him its going to be worth it to just take the time off and give this treatment the best shot at curing him. He is one of the most beloved guys I know and I know there are many who have witnessed his suffering and wished they could do something to help him. This is how we can help him. Please donate whatever you can to aid him in the costliness of all these medical bills  insurances  and inability to work over these next few months. We all wish to see him finally rid of all this sickness and have the ability to live without fear of this illness wrecking havoc on all that he loves and cares for any longer."

Cancer wasn't even on my radar at that point-- I was working full time  with kids with behavioral issues and pursuing my Master's degree in Special Education while also planning my future with my boyfriend of 5 years  Nick. My family had just moved to South Carolina and I was finally finding my footing on my own..until I was hit with this diagnosis on November 2nd  2018.  Suddenly  I found myself having to put everything on pause to deal with cancer. I'm unable to work through treatment (lowered immune system and my clients can be aggressive)  leaving me with no income and way more bills than I can stay on top of. Nick and I are no longer able to buy a house that we were working to save for. I'm working hard to finish this semester of graduate school but I'm left worried about how I will pay for next semester or if I should continue at this point at all (but then loan repayments kick in!).My parents have been incredible in helping with everything  but they can only take so much as well. They currently live in South Carolina and have already spent countless hours and dollars traveling back and forth between SC and PA  taking care of me and working to maintain an income and health insurance. They don't want me to feel the extra stress of finances right now to focus on getting better  but I also want nothing more than to take it off of them as well because this is way more than just me in this fight. My doctors at Hershey Medical Center have been absolutely wonderful in setting my treatment plan. As of right now   the cancer is a large mass in my left breast and a has spread to a few lymph nodes. I'm scheduled to receive 16 weeks of chemotherapy  followed by (at least a single) Mastectomy surgery and lymph node surgery  and then radiation after that. It will be at least 6 months until I can return to work if all goes well  and there will be medications I'll need for up to 10 years after I finish treatment and lifelong monitoring to ensure it doesn't recur.  I have completed one chemo treatment so far (7 to go!) and I know that I can do this with my support system.This is by no means going to be an easy journey  but I have seen how incredible my friends and family have been already been and I have no doubt that they will get my family and I through this difficult time: mentally  emotionally  and financially."

The HPV vaccine severely damaged my immune system in 2010. As a result  it unleashed a plethora of illnesses on my body. Sick within 24 hours after the first shot  I never got better. I was diagnosed with Late Stage Lyme Disease  multiple co-infections  and Autonomic Nervous System damage at the end of 2016.  POTS in 2018.  And many other illnesses along the way. Eight long years  I have been fighting with all my energy and resources to heal. I was forced to stop working in early 2017. I got a PICC line (an IV catheter) in my arm that has been so helpful in stabilizing me  but I have a long ways to go and my improvement requires ongoing treatment of many different types. It all costs money. Lots of money. My medical treatment costs range from 4k-8k a month.  ￼￼￼￼I have reached my health insurance out of pocket maximum the last 3 years. As you can see  I use in network services as much as possible  but many of my treatments and my main doctors (who see me for 2-6 hours at a time) are not covered by insurance. For those costs  I used my own money  my savings (over 100k)  to survive these last 2 years. Now I need help.I have patiently waited for Long Term Disability to come through  but it keeps getting DENIED - I feel like they’re playing games with me.  I’m exhausted.  Emotionally  mentally  physically  financially. My medical debt and bills are significantly rising with the new year. I am appealing the LTD decision  this time with the help of a lawyer  but that takes both time and money due to the complexity of my illnesses.  Even when LTD is approved  the monthly amount won’t fully cover my medical expenses.Anything you can offer - a dollar  a share  a shout out - helps. Please share it  even if you cannot donate. And then re-share it next month. Fundraising is an ongoing effort  and this won’t be successful without help from many people getting the word out. I hate being so vulnerable. I used to pride myself on being able to take care of myself. Now I feel exposed and scared. But I also have faith. In you. In my body. In strangers that I will never meet.Honest financials:-I made no money in 2018 aside from a tax refund of some sort.  After a year of holding my job  my job had to let me go.-I live by myself. Living with family/friends is not a good choice due to my current neurological challenges.  They do come over often to take care of me.-I pay $800/mo for COBRA because my health insurance is actually pretty good.  In talking with other ill friends  many actually pay MORE than I do as independents.-My friends and family have been helping me behind the scenes before a gofundme was suggested.-I used to have over 100k in my savings.  It pains me to say  it’s gone.-Before this I had ZERO debt (I paid off my student loans and car early. I have or HAD great credit). I estimate I am about 50k in debt now - the majority of which is owed to doctors  labs or medical establishments.-I don’t eat out often. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t party.-I use the gym at my apartment to try to do my physical therapy exercises instead of paying for physical therapy right now.-I love the mountain and on occasion I go to snowboard. That’s a splurge for me. Yes my doctors warn me to be especially careful but they also realize the positive mental benefits and how important that is in healing so they actually support it. Note: Yes I can snowboard down a hill but then cannot stand still straight up for 10 minutes without being very sick. If you understand my illnesses  you’ll understand why that makes sense.-Often other splurges are paid for by people who care about me (I’m grateful)  such as pedicures with my girlfriends or coffee with my sister.  But I’m human.  So sometimes I treat myself to Starbucks.  It is important to treat yourself from time to time  no matter your financial situation.  It’s good for the soul and your money mindset. -I want to work and make my own money again  but I cannot successful right now. I’ve tried my entrepreneurial spirit on countless times since I’ve been sick.  Anytime I’ve gotten momentum  my illnesses have derailed my progress and I fall significantly behind to the point where I have to start over.  Healing takes most of my energy.  -I am trying to “Marie Kondo” my house and SELL anything and everything I can on fb marketplace.  Also  if you live in Northern Virginia and want to donate some things for me to sell  that’s another way you could help.  Thank you to my sister in law for this idea.  That’s my situation in a nutshell.  It’s a lot so I am asking for your help. Please share this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart  Melissa. ♥"

Though her physical body seems to have come through more or less intact  it's less certain how her cognitive abilities will be affected in the long term  which in turn will affect her personal  family  and professional lives.  She has a good prognosis but an unknown timeframe. In the meantime  there are medical bills.Her husband  Brian  described the situation better than I ever could  so permit me to quote from his (ridiculously eloquent) Facebook posts about Jen's stroke: * \"Two weeks ago  Jenifer came down with what we would learn to be an atypical pneumonia  mycoplasma pneumonia. In extremely rare cases  this pneumonia can cause blood clots and  in still rarer cases  strokes. On Sunday night  Jenifer suffered two such strokes resulting in symptoms of aphasia and confusion.\" * Since then  her doctors told her  \"You have had a serious brain trauma. It’s concentrated in the area of the brain associated with higher order cognition- I.e language  memory  and attention. You can navigate your house just fine because that’s automatic  all muscle memory and known spaces. Cooking is okay - again physical and immediate  concrete and in the moment. Reading a detailed recipe or essay  not so much.\"She and Brian have significant known medical bills to pay now  and  perhaps worse  the unknown potential for medical and recovery bills in the future. Even with good health insurance  which Jen and Brian have  a health condition like this is still more expensive than many of us can handle on our own.Though I had to do some arm-twisting  Brian and Jen have acquiesced to my suggestion to do a gofundme campaign. I saw in response to Brian's Facebook posts  not surprisingly  that Jen and Brian have many loving friends and family members who WANT to help them get through this  but don't know how. Many  like myself  live far away so we can't bring over casseroles or babysit children. As a financial planner  I am here to attest that Money Is Very Useful.We're asking for $16 000:$10 000: maximum out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for 2018$4 000: 8 additional weeks of therapy at Frazier Neural Rehab$2 000: Miscellaneous additional medical expenses (CT scans  MRI's  and other diagnostics in 2019  provided no further interventions are necessary). Since Jen's stroke  the Alonzo/Wells household has been down to one income  and their expenses have exploded  thanks to medical bills and the extra care Jen needs. As you can imagine  dealing with this and the holidays with two children is challenging  to say the least. On the one hand  I recognize that asking for financial help from you during the holidays is a Big Ask. On the other  this is what the spirit of the holidays and community--however far flung--are all about  right?  Please help me show and share our love and appreciation for Jen   Brian  Fischer  and Meredith by making a contribution to help cover their medical bills. Their need doesn't stop after the holidays  so if you can't swing it until January or later  please do consider helping them out then. If you have questions  please reach out to me megbartelt@gmail.com (I'm in Bellingham  WA) or Brian via Facebook (if you're craving poetry in the guise of prose)."

Katja is trying to hold it together while caring for her very sick husband  her son Christopher who needs intense medical attention as well  and little Emily.

She has a heart of gold  never judges anyone  and is always the first in line when someone needs help. She has become a sister to me over the years and it is so hard to watch what she has gone through and is going through while being a young mother  during a time which is supposed to be the best years of your life. Katja never asks for help and is a very private person. I did ask her for permission or better lovingly forced her to give me permission to do this for her. Please consider giving whatever you can.

If you can  help before January 2019!!Our dear Maggie (Mona) Hall has been dealing with colon cancer for over 3 years now. It has not been easy by any means  but she has kept working  her personal strength is stunning. The day after Thanksgiving she found out the cancer had become Chemo resistant  and the tumor has grown back to the size it was at diagnosis. She is now on leave from work and she & Nick will be moving into an apartment in our (her parents’) building ASAP. That unit becomes vacant Dec 26th. The timing is horrible I know. Here is why we are asking for your help: 1) Movers run about $2000 - Maggie & Nick’s current apartment is on the third floor with no elevator  there is no way to do it without professionals given the volume of stuff they have. We need to be out of that apartment by Jan 1st. Packing help is wanted too! 2) Budgeting $1000 for a second opinion consult with Dr. Lentz at USC  one of the leading doctors in the world for colorectal cancer  plus any tests he needs to run. Because Maggie has Kaiser insurance and Dr. Lentz is non-Kaiser  it needs to be paid out of pocket. We are hoping future treatment there will be covered by Kaiser but that's iffy. 3) Rental on a storage unit for 6 months  $1000. Since they will be downsizing from a 2-bedroom to a one-bedroom  they’ll need to store their extra stuff; this will be about $160 per month for at least 6 months while we find new homes for some very cool stuff. and 4) Other annoying expenses like health insurance (HAH!)  may be asked for in the future as a tier 2 request  but right now we need $4000 minimum to get things started.So  anyway the main thing is: Maggie needs more support than we can swing right now. If you have the ability to help out either with physical labor packing things up or with donations to help make this move & immediate medical care affordable  we would all be so appreciative.  Maggie is our treasure & she probably is special to you as well. We hate asking for help like this   but time is short & this is vital stuff. Please help if you can.

Through it all  she's remained positive  loving  an incredible mom  and one of the strongest people any of us know. She rarely asks for help (and doesn't even want to ask for it now)  but now is the time she needs her friends and family to help her most. Recently  Harper found a lump in her breast. This resulted in a a bi-lateral lumpectomy surgery  and she was diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast Cancer. Her next course of action is 6 weeks of radiation. She's feeling very positive  but still has a long road ahead.Unfortunately  most of the tests and labs were done before her new health insurance kicked in. Which has resulted in a pretty big hospital tab. Additionally  her new insurance does not cover her entire surgery/radiation and will need to pay a decent amount out of pocket. And she'll need to start making these payments soon. Helping Harper will assist her in paying her hospital bills  but also child care. She's still new to Philly and doesn't have the same network she had in Charleston (yet)  so she'll need childcare/extra helping hands while she's recovering and going through treatment. I know most of us wish we could figure out a way to help her through this. Right now  this is one of the best ways to help her. It will truly help ease her stress about money  bills  childcare and get back to a sense of normalcy for her and Ever. Update: It says this campaign benefits Mary Poe. Harper's first name is \"Mary\"  just in case you didn't know aka it's going to the right person."

Afterward  she worked hard through a painful and difficult recovery to walk again  only to learn that another tumor has now returned. Doctors have termed it ‘very aggressive’ and told her that surgery is not an option.Chemo is the prescribed treatment and presently she has waited over seven week for insurance to approve it.Making matters worse  and on top of everything else  earlier this month Jennifer was terminated from her job because of her extended inability to work.

Heather moved in November to start her new job as a teacher at a local daycare  while Vinny stayed behind in Scranton to finish his last few weeks of work with the intent of joining Heather and Amelie the first week of January in time for Aoife’s birth  their first child together. While in Scranton for the Christmas holiday  Vinny began to feel ill and by December 30th was in the hospital with a potentially fatal condition called sepsis. Vinny’s last day of work was December 23rd and his health insurance covered him until December 31st. He will now have to pay out-of-pocket to contribute to COBRA in order to keep his coverage  but he has no income to do so.Vinny has endured many complications and procedures the past week  including surgery  a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia and damaged lungs. With that comes numerous labs  scans  blood tests  fluids  plus a lengthy stay at the hospital etc. It all adds up. What’s worse  there is a chance he will have to be intubated and placed in an induced coma to allow his severely damaged lungs to heal. There is a good change he is going to miss the birth of his first child  but his optimism is humbling. This evening he told me he’s made peace with the fact he may not be present for her birth. “I’d rather miss the birth of my child than miss the lives of both she and Amelie (who has become a daughter to him).”Meanwhile  my nearly 9-months pregnant sister  is also trying to support herself  Amelie and unborn daughter on one very small income to stay afloat while Daddy Vinny gets well enough to return to them. Heather is struggling to afford childcare currently  but will soon be faced with the challenge of having no income during her unpaid maternity leave. She and Amelie are currently sharing a bedroom at a dear friend’s house until they are stable enough to afford an apartment of their own.WHAT HAPPENED?On the evening of December 30th  my 8 1/2-months pregnant sister  Heather  rushed her boyfriend Vinny to the Regional Hospital of Scranton Emergency Room. When they arrived at the entrance  Vinny stepped out of the passenger side  vomited  and in my sister’s words  “closed the door with his face” as he collapsed and temporarily lost consciousness. After futile attempts to lift him herself  Heather’s cries for help were heard and help came running to assist Vinny into the ER. The diagnosis? Severe Sepsis caused by a tooth infection. Sepsis  depending on how severe  is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by your immune system’s response to an infection. Without timely treatment  sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage  organ failure  and death. Vinny was likely days away from his condition turning fatal. Within the first few days of the sepsis diagnosis  Vinny went through powerful antibiotic treatments  emergency surgery to remove a tooth and drain an abscess  and was also diagnosed with lung damage and pneumonia. Now  there is a chance he will have to be intubated and placed in an induced coma to allow his severely damaged lungs to heal. He will be in the hospital for at least another week  if not more.WHAT WILL THESE FUNDS HELP WITH?I’m hoping these funds will be available to help Vinny and Heather pay for medical bills as well as living expenses until they are both able to bring in an income. They will specifically pay for:-Vinny’s growing medical expenses.-Supplemental income for Vinny  Heather and Amelie after baby Aoife is born (my sister has to go on 6 to 12-week unpaid maternity leave).-Childcare- for before Aoife is born  so my sister can work.-Food-Bills and daily expensesThe clock is really ticking on this one. Heather is due January 27th  but could go into labor at any moment. So the sooner they have some funds  the better. All the funds will go directly to Vinny and Heather. Those of you who have the pleasure of knowing Heather  Vinny and Amelie can attest to their amazing character  love  kindness and generosity to everyone they meet. Please join me in raising them up during this difficult but joyous time in their lives. All my love and appreciation Michelle Bixby"

Within 3 months the body will naturally get rid of these dead  frozen tumor cells and the immune system will be boosted at the same time to regain strength and health.Jenn needs a couple of these treatments because the body can digest only so many dead cancer cells at once.

We need the help of friends  family  and even strangers. We are in dire need of saving Consuella's life  a mother of 2 amazing young children aged 4 and 13.  Consuella is a young 36 year old woman who has an opportunity to live a long and fruitful life with her children. Consuella has severely damaged lungs from a condition called Pulmonary Fibrosis which offers a lifespan of 5 years on average from diagnosis. Today we are fundraising for a lung transplant and to help her and the people helping alleviate a lot of the stress and burden of her care. Each day adds more pressure and stress to the situation. With limited resources and funds  the family and Consuella have been stretched very thin. If you are a stranger reading this please read her story and picture this amazing woman as your friend  sister  or daughter. She loves every person she meets and approaches life with an infectious smile and unwavering optimism. You cannot help but smile when she smiles. Consuella has always put everyone else's needs before her own  friends  family  and even strangers. We are hoping that her life of helping strangers will come full circle and be returned to her in spades. The costs of saving Consuellas life are within reach and achievable. We can all save a life today  we can save a mother  a friend  and my daughter. Lung Transplants are normally $1M  with additional fees incurred of over $6K per month in medical costs not covered; this amount does not include medication required before and after; that is not covered by health insurance which will be required once the transplant takes place of over $500 monthly so that the body does not reject the lungs. In addition  a  family member (medical caregiver) must dedicate their lives to ensuring Consuella has the proper care she needs 24/7  this is a mandatory requirement before  during  and after in order for her to be considered for a lung transplant. Without this  in place  there will be no consideration. Funds raised will allow me  Consuella's Mother   to care for her 24/7 and to serve as the beneficiary and manager of funds raised. Please  I am kindly asking that you make a donation today. Any sized donation will go a long way and help save my daughters life. If you cannot make a donation today please share our story with your friends and family within your social circles. perhaps someone you know is willing to help or to share further. Thank you!

She was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was just 5 days old. After 19 years and the latest bout of the flu last January  she was told that she will need a lung transplant. Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that starts when the cells don’t release salt properly. Due to this  Analiese’s body produces a thick mucus that clogs her pancreatic ducts  intestines  sinus cavity and lungs. She suffers from frequent upper respiratory infections and illness. Because of this  she describes her daily battle to breathe  similar to the same sensation as plugging your nose and taking every breath as if through a straw.Her case is more complicated because she also has Hyper IGD syndrome. The combination of the two diseases makes her a frequent ER visitor and resident at the U of I. She spent 104 days of 2018 in the hospital and is currently back due to severe inflammation and respiratory infections.Despite what Analiese is going through  the Chapman’s are lucky. Community members who love and support Analiese surround them. For years  they have worn Analiese’s face on their T-shirts  held walkathons to raise funds and awareness for Cystic Fibrosis  lined up to visit her in the hospital  and followed her journey through social media – all under the Team Analiese banner.Maybe you know Analiese. Maybe you knew her when she went four-wheeling or volunteered with the Riverdale Fire Department. Maybe you met her in college classes or when she worked at the community college bookstore. Maybe you know that she likes art  caring for her nieces  competing in water fights  sitting around a bonfire in her backyard  cooking dinners for her parents  or spending time with her friends – all the activities 19 year-olds enjoy.So now  Team Analiese has a new mission. Analiese needs new lungs so she can get back to all those things. And we need you to join us.Why we need support-While Analiese’s health insurance will help cover major medical expenses  it does not cover everything. The Chapmans live more than an hour from Iowa City where the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics are  that has been treating Analiese since she was a baby. We expect Analiese will get much sicker as she is waiting for her new lungs. Her mom has already taken a leave of absence from work because Analiese has gotten so sick and will have to take off another minimum of 3 months to take care of her during recovery. All while her dad travels back and forth from their home in LeClaire  Iowa to keep working.Your donations-Your donations will help the family with expenses related to her lung transplant- travel  hotel  bills  food  etc. After surgery  if things go smoothly  Analiese will spend some time in the ICU and about two weeks in the hospital. When she’s released from the hospital  she’ll need to spend two to four weeks within 30 minutes of the hospital in case complications arise. When she is finally able to go home  she’ll need to travel back to the hospital each week or sometimes more for testing. Your donations will help with lodging; food  transportation  and time off Analiese’s parents need to take to be by her side. What you can do right now-Register to be an organ donor: Analiese needs new lungs  and we know that can only happen because a caring individual in life decided to donate their organs after death. Please register to donate. You won’t need you organs when you pass away  and people like Analiese will make good use of them. It gives them a second chance at life. Learn how to register in your state here:  https://www.organdonor.gov.Donate to this campaign: Your generous donations will keep this family afloat while they are facing one of the toughest medical trials of Analiese’s life.

He is a young male  but we can't contact him and proceed with further testing until insurance approves Duke to do the transplant. If he is determined not to match  we will then go with an unmatched cord blood donor.  We are not asking anyone else to donate bone marrow at this time  as by the time the swabs get mailed and put in the system she would have already had her transplant. Time is ticking and we can't wait any longer for a \"perfect\" match. :(Brelynn suffers from a form of Combined Variable Immune Deficiency specifically called IKAROS. It is a gene defect. It causes her to make no B cells and only partial T cells function. This leaves her open to lots of infection. Brelynn was a little over two-years old the first time she was in public. Over the years  we have tried to make her life more normal taking her to dinner  allowing her to play at the park  even taking her to the movies for a special evening. As time goes on  Brelynn has proven she is more sickly. Based off the limited knowledge they do have  it is apparent Brelynn will only get sicker from here. It is best to do the transplant now  while she is considered well with minimal organ damage. Over time the pneumonia's she has had yearly  as well as various infections will eventually take their toll.To date the researchers have discovered 13 patients with this gene mutation. 3 children have had transplants of the 13  one passed and 2 are living. If we can find a close match Brelynn's chance of successful outcome is about 80%. This would completely cure her and revamp her immune system. She would no longer have weekly infusions  Pentamidine treatments  etc. She could go to school  be in public just like normal children. There are medications she would have to take and still see doctors to confirm everything is working like it should. There are lists of complications that I don't want to talk about unless they happen. Some minor and some causing organ failure and fatality.Our plan at this time is to move to Duke 3 weeks prior to transplant for chemo. She will have extensive treatments to completely wipe out her immune system that she does have. Once there we will be in the hospital for 2 months give or take. I have a list of 10 of the closest family members and they are the only ones that will be allowed to visit Brelynn while in the hospital. It is very important that she not get sick while the cells are grafting. After the 2 months in the hospital  we will move to the house with Scotty  Bryson and Granny for at the least 4 months. If she gets sick at any time of course the stays for all of this will change. We were told to be prepared for 6 months to a year in NC.The doctors asked that I have at least 1 to 2 people with me at all times during this because Brelynn can never be left alone in the hospital room  for support and caring for her round the clock. I will need breaks as well even though I will be staying at the hospital with her.Ronald McDonald does not provide living arrangements for more than 2 people in the family. They can only accommodate one bedroom and obviously we cannot all stay there.I was told that the transplant team does own a home  but as of right now they have a family staying there. I have been looking at homes for rent in the area and on average they are $850-$1300 per month. Meanwhile  we have to pay our bills here  house payment  etc. and will have to live there (rent  lights  food  insurance  etc). I'm starting the fundraising now so when the time comes we hope to not have to worry about bills while being with our daughter for the fight for her life.I have been granted a one-year leave of absence from work. My husband  Scotty will be taking the 6 months off to go to Duke with us. We initially tried to get a transfer  but her doctors decided that was not the best decision because he works in the public and that would bring germs into the hospital/home to Brelynn that could make her very sick or potentially kill her. We will still have to pay his job for our normal expenditures  health insurance  retirement  etc during this time. Also  we were informed once insurance approves  they will debate with Duke Children's Hospital on how much they are willing to pay. Example: Insurance agrees to pay 80 000 and the hospital charges 100 000 we will be responsible for paying the 20 000 up front for her transplant. To the ones that want to contribute  we have set a goal of 30 000. If we exceed that amount any money not spent at Duke will be put in an account for Brelynn later in life or whenever she needs it.Please above all keep us in constant prayer and any contribution is greatly appreciated.Love from all of us  Brelynn and Seeger Family"

She has kept her medical issues private for the most part but things have taken a turn for the worst and we need everyone’s help to help her and her family. Crystal has already fought the battle with cancer once and by God’s Grace she beat it! But just like we all know -cancer has a mind of its own. They have found more cancer on the protective layer between her brain and skull and also some spots on her liver. She initially was told about 4 weeks ago that she only had 2 more months to live. Imagine being told that and having to tell your 11 year old son and your loving husband that they may have to live life without you? This is unimaginable for most of us. Her drs have now made a plan and we are all hoping and praying this chemo and radiation she is going through will help Crystal to live a long and happy life with her family. Due to her illness  Crystal has not been able to work since close to the end of 2018. She has now lost her health insurance which means one weeks worth of her medication is $500 that her family is having to pay out of pocket! And that doesn’t even count the medical bills piling up from being in and out of the hospital. It took a lot of convincing to even let us do any type of fundraising for Crystal as she and her husband are never looking for a handout. But they can’t fight this fight alone! They need our help and ANY amount can help towards her living a longer life. If you aren’t able to donate please say a prayer for Crystal and her family.

I hope you take the time to read Beth’s story and find it in your heart to help her out in any way you can. This is an urgent situation!Beth is having surgery within a month! She is scared  and has every right to be. This is a big surgery  but one that will hopefully change her life for the better. She is currently out of work for the most part due to the level of pain she is in  and then after surgery she will be recovering for some time and will be completely without income. Those who know Beth know she would give you her last dollar if she could. She is one of the most caring  and loving humans I know. She loves the outdoors and spends a lot of her time hiking with friends and solo. She is witty  crass  talented  and one of my favorite people who I force to watch scary movies with. Beth HATES to ask for help  as she has been hustling since the moment she arrived in the city of angels. After her surgery she will be down anywhere from 3-6 months  depending on how her surgery goes and how she recovers. She has past medical bills she still pays for  as well as her standard living expenses. She’s heading into this surgery not knowing how she will be able to support herself. The stress is a lot  and really takes a toll on her mentally and physically. During this time of giving  I ask for your love and donation to help our girl heal without added stress. She needs to focus on recovery and get back out hiking  working out  and being the fun  silly Beth we know and love. You can read her entire story below of how this started  what she has done to help her situation  and how she got to this scary point of spine surgery. Beth’s Story:From the ages of 15–28  Beth has been living with a debilitating spine disorder called Juvenile Disc Disease. Basically  a degenerative disc disease that is quite uncommon in anyone under the age of 50.She was kicked off her parents’ insurance plan (not their doing) as soon as she graduated college at the age of 22. She moved out here to L.A. with hopes and dreams that were quickly dashed as her health continued to deteriorate; She needed to hold down a steady enough job so that she could procure health insurance.  She was subjected to steroid injections  epidural injections  trigger point injections (of which you don’t get anesthetic for); all the opiates (because that’s what they’re peddling)  physical therapy  acupuncture  and even the option to “freeze” her nerves. She opted out of freezing her nerves as a last-ditch effort to control the heaping amounts of debilitating pain she was. When she was 25  she had the spine of a 65-year-old woman; arthritis  most of her spine was bone on bone  and what discs were left were slipped or bulging by the age of 28. Beth then had stem cells from a clinic in Hollywood. She was at the point where she could barely stand for more than an hour or two. This helped her greatly  and gave her back so much of her life. During the past five years her life has been relatively pain free. The gift of not being in a wheelchair  of not having to have constant medical procedure “Band-Aids” unleashed on her has been extraordinary. However  not all gifts last forever  her spine disease has come back this past year  and in full force: Two of Beth’s discs are already “dead”  three are bulging  one or two have spurs on them  and one has slipped so much this past year. The ultimate fear is that she could become paralyzed if a surgery doesn’t happen. Please send your love and positive vibes to Beth."

On January 2nd  2011 Staci called her family with horrifying news that she had been in a car accident with her mom  step dad  and daughter. The medics believed her to be okay despite being t-boned by a truck on her side of the vehicle at 60 miles an hour. Months went by and she slowly started losing weight and noticing internal pain. She started seeing doctor after doctor and by January 2012 a gastrointestinal doctor believed it was her gall bladder causing the pain. She had emergency surgery to remove it  but months later the pain was still there. Staci has always described her pain as a lady with high heels standing on top of her. By May of 2012  she had gone from 145 pounds down to 120 and it was painful for her to eat and drink. She went to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and they discovered Pelvic Congestion Syndrome and performed an embolism to help address the condition. She was still having pain and by the end of the summer of 2012 they told her there was nothing more they could do. Staci continued to try and find the underlying problem and thankfully she had an angel on her side. Angie was an ultrasound technician that worked for her family doctor and spent endless hours doing research of Staci’s symptoms. Angie believed that Staci had a rare syndrome called Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS) and asked the GI Doctor to order a specific test. Finally  in September of 2012  after another series of tests and a year-and-a-half after the car accident  we received news that she did in fact have SMAS. Staci went back to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville only to be told that many doctors do not believe SMAS is real. SMAS  or Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome  is the compression of the 3rd portion of the duodenum between the Abdominal Aorta (AA) and the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA). SMAS is also known as Wilkie’s Syndrome or Cast Syndrome. SMAS can develop naturally or due to traumatic injury. There are other related symptoms and syndromes such as Nutcracker Syndrome  Pelvic Varicose Veins  Reverse Peristalsis  Gastroparesis  Gallbladder failure  and Malabsorption Syndrome. Here is a picture which describes the SMA compression of the Duodenum causing the inability to eat and drink normally:By November of 2012  Staci’ weight was down to 102 pounds and they needed to do something so  they scheduled Duodenum bypass surgery at Johns Hopkins in Maryland. The goal was to bypass the compressed section of the Duodenum so she could eat and drink normally. The family believed it had fixed her and Staci was able to eat  drink  and began gaining weight. She was up to 120 pounds and finally had relief but  roughly 6 months later  the issues seriously returned.The pain and weight loss continued. Through online support groups they discovered a doctor in Virginia that had studied under Dr. Sandmann  a German physician that had performed and perfected SMA transposition surgeries. In February of 2016 the family made the trip to Virginia and Staci received a SMA transposition surgery where the Superior Mesenteric Artery is detached from the aortic artery and reattached at a lower point to remove compression of the intestines. Once again Staci felt much improved. Her appetite was back  the pain lessened  and she began to gain weight. Unfortunately  this is the song that never ends. She returned to Virginia in pain and tests showed that her renal vein was being crushed potentially by scar tissue. The solution was to do a bovine graft on the vein. Once again  that surgery made Staci feel improved only to feel worse again. This same cycle has been going on for almost 8 years now.SMAS is a very rare disease that has only affected between .013 - .3% of the population. Staci and her daughter Tara have been all over the country seeing doctors and have yet to find anyone who will do the surgery that Dr. Sandmann has perfected in Germany. Dr. Sandmann will go in and do everything at once versus addressing the issues one at a time. Therefore  her only hope of survival is to travel to Germany and have the surgery.  The cost of the surgery is between $50-$60 000 and is not covered by American Health Insurance. It would also require a lengthy stay in a hotel after surgery to do follow up appointments and Staci will need a family member with her to assist with recovery and care.As a family we are foregoing Christmas gifts this year and donating to Staci in memory of my beautiful sister  JoAnn DiMaso  who passed away from Cancer on October 31st. JoAnn would want us to start this fund as she was all about helping others  especially family.  We are asking for any donation you are able to make and hope to raise atleast $75 000 to pay for the consult  travel to Germany  surgery and necessary lodging and other expenses that will be incurred. Staci is an incredible person who spends all of her time helping other SMAS patients and their families and  with your help  this life saving surgery could pave the way for others. Thank you in advance for your generosity.Here are some before and after pictures of Staci:"

I hope you take the time to read Beth’s story and find it in your heart to help her out in any way you can. This is an urgent situation!Beth is having surgery within a month! She is scared  and has every right to be. This is a big surgery  but one that will hopefully change her life for the better. She is currently out of work for the most part due to the level of pain she is in  and then after surgery she will be recovering for some time and will be completely without income. Those who know Beth know she would give you her last dollar if she could. She is one of the most caring  and loving humans I know. She loves the outdoors and spends a lot of her time hiking with friends and solo. She is witty  crass  talented  and one of my favorite people who I force to watch scary movies with. Beth HATES to ask for help  as she has been hustling since the moment she arrived in the city of angels. After her surgery she will be down anywhere from 3-6 months  depending on how her surgery goes and how she recovers. She has past medical bills she still pays for  as well as her standard living expenses. She’s heading into this surgery not knowing how she will be able to support herself. The stress is a lot  and really takes a toll on her mentally and physically. During this time of giving  I ask for your love and donation to help our girl heal without added stress. She needs to focus on recovery and get back out hiking  working out  and being the fun  silly Beth we know and love. You can read her entire story below of how this started  what she has done to help her situation  and how she got to this scary point of spine surgery. Beth’s Story:From the ages of 15–28  Beth has been living with a debilitating spine disorder called Juvenile Disc Disease. Basically  a degenerative disc disease that is quite uncommon in anyone under the age of 50.She was kicked off her parents’ insurance plan (not their doing) as soon as she graduated college at the age of 22. She moved out here to L.A. with hopes and dreams that were quickly dashed as her health continued to deteriorate; She needed to hold down a steady enough job so that she could procure health insurance.  She was subjected to steroid injections  epidural injections  trigger point injections (of which you don’t get anesthetic for); all the opiates (because that’s what they’re peddling)  physical therapy  acupuncture  and even the option to “freeze” her nerves. She opted out of freezing her nerves as a last-ditch effort to control the heaping amounts of debilitating pain she was. When she was 25  she had the spine of a 65-year-old woman; arthritis  most of her spine was bone on bone  and what discs were left were slipped or bulging by the age of 28. Beth then had stem cells from a clinic in Hollywood. She was at the point where she could barely stand for more than an hour or two. This helped her greatly  and gave her back so much of her life. During the past five years her life has been relatively pain free. The gift of not being in a wheelchair  of not having to have constant medical procedure “Band-Aids” unleashed on her has been extraordinary. However  not all gifts last forever  her spine disease has come back this past year  and in full force: Two of Beth’s discs are already “dead”  three are bulging  one or two have spurs on them  and one has slipped so much this past year. The ultimate fear is that she could become paralyzed if a surgery doesn’t happen. Please send your love and positive vibes to Beth."

The CT Scan revealed a mass on her liver.Having Stage II Breast Cancer is one thing  but a distant metastasis to the liver is quite another.

Nor have we seen the results of the latest CT Scan. As we know  we'll update this page with information.Thankfully  Didi feels fantastic! The only symptom she has had was a tender lymph node. Her blood work is perfect!Regardless  the late stage and two completely unrelated pathologies  constrains our treatment options. Although we are hopeful to find a path of longevity (with continued quality)  our Health Insurance will only cover certain treatments. Some well documented alternate treatments may require international travel. In addition   Sam has not worked in his current position long enough to qualify for family-disability leave and needless to say  high Health Insurance premiums and sky-high deductibles foretell difficult financial waters as well.We are keeping the goal low for now  until we have some specifics to share.

In December of 2018​ after a long illness that was first diagnosed as ​\"flu hypertension headaches ​\" their ​unexpected yet worst fears were confirmed.  Not only had her ​breast cancer returned but it had ​also spread to multiple lymph nodes in her chest  left lung  ​along with multiple tumors in her brain. Heather's treatment ​has been aggressive including monthly injections  oral medications   chemotherapy at Mercy Oncology in Portland  additional radiation appointments in Augusta as well as ​appointments at Dana Farber in Boston to plan ​possible experimental treatments via ​information gathered from CT and PET scans.At the same time  their daughter Paige also ​fell ill.  After a spending a week at Waldo County General with a misdiagnosis of MRSA  Paige was sent home where her condition worsened.  She was ​later referred and admitted to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor where she ​was treated for over one month.  They ​eventually found that she was suffering from Crohn's disease.  Paige endured ​over 15 surgeries during her stay and is continuing treatment at home. ​She and her family are required to make regular trips to Bangor ​(over an hour away) for infusions of Crohn's medication and iron supplements.  She will need monthly followups ​from the surgeries for the foreseeable future and has a long road of recovery ahead of her.While Matt  Heather's husband and Paige's father  does have health insurance through his employer  both of their illnesses spanned two years​. ​Maximum out of pocket was hit within two months.   Costly premiums  high co-pays  and those out-of-pocket costs for items not covered by their plan are piling up ​fast with more bills to follow as the hospital billing department continues to catch up.  Matt has had to take unpaid family leave from work ​to care for his family compounding the lack of income to the bills ​that keep coming in.  Heather is obviously unable to work so her ​past ability to create and contribute income ​to the family has stopped while she receives her treatments. This year will be a difficult one on all fronts. The money donated here is intended to aid in paying the many medical bills they have already received and hopefully help with the bills in their foreseeable future.  ​Beyond medical bills  there is heat  electricity  car repairs  and the basic necessities needed to provide a safe home to recover.

However  she learned in August that she had an aggressive form of breast cancer and plans changed. As Jayna had just finished her postdoc  she was no longer covered by health insurance. Instead of returning to U.S. to get treated  she opted to stay abroad and get treatment in France and Spain. Unfortunately  she had  very limited time remaining on her visa and was paying for medical treatment as well as 50 000 000 plane tickets to fly from France to countries outside the Schengen Area  returning to France for the day for a medical appointment  and flying out the same day. The silver lining is that Jayna has not been going through this alone.

Then  one year ago today  on October 24  2017  Wendy suffered a significant head injury at home. She lost consciousness and fell head first onto her bathroom floor. Wendy's neighbor rushed her to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a severe concussion.

It compromises the immune system. The tick bite can bring on several different other types of serious infections. It can leave a person weak  bedridden  with little quality of life. This is the state of our daughter is in. It kills us to watch her suffering each new day. Effective treatments of Lyme in the early stages is a common offering. It's covered by insurance. Lyme that goes undetected or misdiagnosed requires specific treatments from medical specialists. These treatments are rarely covered by health insurance. Lyme and it’s co-infections can often go undetected. They share many common symptoms with other conditions. And as such  Lyme often sneaks under the radar and the conditions continue to worsen.And this is what happened to our daughter. She was bit by a deer tick when she was a child. There were was not a tell-tale bulls-eye rash. Despite many lab tests  her Lymes went misdiagnosed for many painful years. Caitlin suffered from fatigue  unexplained rashes  infections  bronchitis  migraines  and other debilitating symptoms. Her body was losing the battle against stealth-like  disease-producing microbes. Over time  her symptoms intensified. She began to have joint pain  fevers  swollen lymph nodes  small blood vessel inflammations  night sweats and tachcardia.   She became unable to sleep well at night. She went to scores of specialists  who gave many different diagnoses  none of which made sense. After tons of lab work  Caitlin received a diagnosis of Chronic Lyme’s Disease. Along with a severe co-infection of Bartonella. Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete called Borrelia.  It changes shapes and moves into different tissues and compartments and can change forms to evade being killed.   Bartonella are bacteria that live primarily inside the lining of the blood vessels.  Both form biofilms and cysts  making the bacteria difficult to kill.    A person with a co-infection experiences more symptoms  and a longer recovery.   For more information please look at:    www.lymedisease.org. By the winter of 2018 Caitlin became bedridden  unable to attend her college classes. She began to have cognitive and neurological symptoms.  Caitlin's pain is unrelenting.After all the expenses involved in arriving at a diagnosis. After all the frustration and pain. There is now hope. She's accepted into treatment by a rheumatologist out of Yale. One considered the leading doctor in beating Lyme. His patients have a very high recovery rate. And we have confidence that he will do the same for Caitlin.  Chronic Lyme and Bartonella usually takes two years of monthly treatment to recover.  The treatments are expensive  not covered by insurance  and out of pocket for the patients.   We pray every day for our child’s recovery. We're asking for any help towards covering her treatment expenses. Any donation of any size is a huge help.If you would be so kind  please help us share this Go Fund Me Page with others. It’s crucial to successful recovery of our daughter. We need to reach as many potential contributors as possible.Bless you  and thank you for your consideration and support.Caitlin’s Mom  Dad  and Brother: Diana  Les  and Ian McLean"

She's the teacher who is always willing to listen to a parents concern  who does everything in her power to make sure that our little ones have a good day and are happy learners. She's patient  kind  loving and extremely hard-working. She's always helping others and now it's our turn to return the favor. How can 2 people with good jobs  working overtime  with one child and a small house fall between the healthcare cracks?  They are just over the limit to receive aid .They were faced with the choice to pay almost as much as their mortgage for insurance or go uninsured. Their child gets healthcare through a school policy  though expensive and incomplete. Tate has forgone health insurance the past few years because it would mean getting a third job and not being available for her daughter. A healthy young adult  she hoped she would resolve this in the coming years.Over the past few months she has suffered excruciating pain  diagnosed as a very large kidney stone  blocking her kidney and causing infection and swelling in the surrounding organs. She was advised to have surgery immediately to save her kidney and prevent infections from causing an even more critical problem.Imagine her surprise  sitting in the admitting room on the day of the surgery when the flustered doctor appeared to tell her that because she has no insurance  she could not be treated. The doctor had called other hospitals and none would take her.Eventually an advocate found treatment for her at Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon. She is working to solve her insurance issue  but she will still need support. Her costs will be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Every year Auburn Montessori chooses an organization- the homeless shelters  Mothers in transition  animal rescues  and raise money for a good cause. It reminds children that giving is as important as receiving. Why shouldn’t we take on the needs of one of our own? Tate works 40+ hours a week and gives every Saturday to a horse rescue center. She is probably the most kind  conscientious  giving  hard working woman I have ever met. Please  if you know her  and you are in the mind to help and support someone in need this season  consider giving to our GOFUNDME account."

Treatments will be continual and ongoing the rest of her life. Eva suffers also from a partially collapsed lung and a compound fracture caused by the breakdown of the bone in her spine which is adding to her debilitating back pain. She will soon be having radiation treatments for the severe pain in the spine and other areas of her body. Because this cancer is hormone positive  they are planning on controlling it by blocking the hormone production. They will put Eva into menopause.  This will stop the production of estrogen the cancer thrives on  the doctors are planning to remove her ovaries very soon. Then control further spread with a hormonal treatment. Since chemotherapy can't cure the bones  they aren't going to put her through the torture of that treatment  it wouldn't solve the problem.   If that's not enough  she is also anemic and the infusions are $400/week out of pocket  that's after insurance pays their portion of the $7 000.00 per treatment.  They hope she wont need too many. The funds we raise will aid in medication  medical out of pocket  lower paychecks from days missed at work during absences for treatment  out of pocket expenses  travel  and just by helping in general to close the gap caused by this illness. Other ways Eva can use help.....cooking freezable dishes! Eva seems the most concerned about keeping her little mouths fed without turning to fast food or dry cereal and milk. Fast food is unhealthy and will add to the family's regular grocery bill where they are u⁴ will help  casseroles  freezer meals  etc.  The family is going to look for a deep freeze this week to store frozen meals in. Eva is trying to prepare to be down a little while to get this going and under control but she's already not able to stand in the kitchen.  A donated freezer would be greatly appreciated as were hoping to fill it with premade meals.  This situation is time sensitive because of how quick this has all transpired  the sudden and quick financial burden  even with health insurance  is quickly taking its toll on this 2 income family of 6. We are also taking cash donations at the office if you are local to Springtown  TX. We're using any cash donated for groceries.

She just moved to NYC from Canandaigua two years ago and has no family in NYC. She had to borrow 20 sick days in order to take maternity leave. She is not allowed to borrow more than 20 days. If she goes beyond 20 days  she will go off payroll and lose her health insurance. Her family depends upon her for health insurance and for her income. She will start chemotherapy in 3 days. She will need to take 50 sick days to cover the time that she will have to take off from work for the chemotherapy treatment and the two operations. I would like to raise enough money for her to purchase those 50 sick days. She is able to \"buy\" days from the Department of Education for $280 per day. This will allow her to stay on payroll and keep her health insurance.I deeply understand what Alyson is going through  as I was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and I also had an 11 month old daughter at the time. I was incredibly fortunate to have the entire school community come to my aid. They enabled me to get enough sick days to not have to work while undergoing chemotherapy and I feel so grateful to now be in a position to help Alyson receive the same aid that I was lucky enough to receive. It is exhausting going through chemotherapy when you have an infant who is still waking up throughout the night. In addition  working in an elementary school exposes the body to so many bacteria and viruses  it is just not safe to be in that environment when one's immune system is so compromised.If you are able to help Alyson in any way  she would be so forever grateful. If we are able to raise more than the $14 000 she will need to buy her sick days  Alyson will use the additional funds to pay for co-pays  a wig  travel expenses to and from chemotherapy and any other additional medical expenses she may incur.Thank you so much and best wishes to you all Victoria Lavington"

On January 4  David was tentatively diagnosed with  MS. During the week preceding his birthday  February 3  things began to change rapidly. His falling increased  and it became obvious he could no longer wait to see the MS specialist. At the advice of the Neurologist  he entered St David's Hospital in Austin on Feb. 4th   where a team of doctors ran many more tests. The diagnosis of Tumefactive MS was made  he was treated with steroids  and he was sent home with an appointment to see an MS/Autoimmune specialist 2 days later. When David saw the doctor  Feb. 14th  she sent him straight to Dell Seton emergency to be admitted.  After the doctors saw the results of an MRI taken on Feb. 11th  at St David's  they performed another MRI and decided to do a brain biopsy. Finally an answer  just not what we wanted to hear. David has an inoperable brain tumor in the cortex of the frontal lobe. It is a Primary Bcell CNS lymphoma. The good news is that it is classified stage 1 because it hasn't spread anywhere else.  Dave is undergoing chemotherapy now. He has completed the first round and goes back for the second round next week. Today he is a patient at the Central Texas Rehabilitation Hospital. He has been in the hospital minus 2 days since Feb. 4th. When he goes back for chemo on March 13  he will be back at Dell Seton. David's spirit continues to amaze me. He always says  \"God brought me to it  and I know He will get me through it.\" Denise is working at their shop and driving to Austin in the afternoons. They covet your prayers  which they depend on and can feel daily. So many people have asked how else they can help that I set up this page to provide one way. Although they have health insurance the expenses for treatment are staggering  and simple things like the gas back and forth everyday are mounting up. David is going to need a ramp at the house when he gets to come home.  He is also going to need an adjustable bed as well as potential other modifications at home.Denise and David have given so much to so many that I convinced her to let me allow others to help them. They are humbled at the outpouring of love  prayers  and visits that they have already received.We are continually amazed by what God does everyday. We are praying for His healing as He guides the doctors."

Oct. 3rd  our wonderful  talented sweet 24 yr old son Landon was involved in a very serious car wreck where the driver side was crushed in by a concrete guardrail. He was knocked unconscious and badly bleeding to death internally. His best friend Trevor held him in his arms waiting for EMS personnel to arrive  keeping him alert once he gained consciousness and all the while thinking Landon might die in his arms right there. Landon had been totally crushed in between the door and the center console. Somehow with a huge burst of adrenaline he was painfully able to lift himself out of that small crushed in car area. Gratefully  no other persons were hurt in this tragic accident. Landon was actually out doing business errands on his day off  in his best suit (and there were no drugs or alcohol or reckless driving involved in the event.) Just a scary  awful  freak  automobile accident.Landon amazingly survived and was rushed to a trauma center here in Austin  Texas (at Saint David’s South Hospital) and underwent emergency surgery to repair a lacerated liver  ruptured bladder  and damaged bleeding stomach  stopping the major bleeding. He also suffered from multiple lung contusions  fractured ribs  severe bruising and other cuts from glass  as well as a tracheal hematoma. His pelvis has more fractures then you can really count  it was basically shattered. Landon was in the ICU trauma unit for a week  then moved to another recovery room for another long week. His mother Tiffany was by his side almost 24/7  the entire time  advocating for very best care & pain management for Landon while in the hospital during this excruciating crisis.Two days later after the first surgery  he went through another complicated Orthopedic surgery to put his pelvis back together with large metal screw pins. Landon has undergone a lot of severe pain  but is determined to recuperate. Thankfully we requested the help of a pain management specialist who finally got the right medication cocktail to help manage Landon’s pain without him becoming addicted to painkillers in this healing process. During one long stretch in the ICU he had 12 different tubes in different parts of his body and was on about a dozen different medications!“Landitty”  as he’s affectionately referred to by friends  has a long road ahead of him as his full recovery will take at least a year. Much of his physical rehabilitation and huge hospital bill are not covered by his community medical care program. His mother Tiffany has gladly made quick life adjustments in order to be his full-time caretaker  but she is not trained in medical rehabilitation. Landon needs ongoing physical therapy  doctor’s/specialist visits  and medical equipment that costs far more significant funds than his familys’ limited resources can currently support.Landon deserves to get the proper care so that he heals correctly and with no extra added pain. Most patients with these types of severe injuries go straight from the hospital to a medical rehabilitation facility   but that was not within our budget and is not covered by his medical help program. Unfortunately his type of care is very expensive and since his recovery is going to take so long and it will add up. The bulk costs are going to be from the first 6 months of his recovery and all the specialists he has to see  the medication costs  and his hospital bill which which will not all be covered and would fall on him to pay. He has just qualified for some reduced cost for rehab  thru a state-funded program  which will help thankfully.We are privileged to have Landon back at home now living with us  his adoring family  to help him thoroughly recover as much as possible  and as soon as possible! Unfortunately our own financial abilities do not match the love and good intentions in our breaking  but very hopeful ❤️ hearts. Landon had saved his money for a long time to come up with the $3 000 cash down payment for his 2004 (newer) used car  since his existing little old 2000 Ford Focus was at the end of its lifespan and had no A/C for a very long time either. He even sold prized possessions to come up with the down payment  which of course he has now lost all $3000 since the car was totaled. Landon had just been at a new job he really liked for two months  working as an inventory manager/vehicle porter for a local big Mazda dealership. Therefore  he did not yet have any health insurance unfortunately.Landon is a super good person and shows sincere interest in everyone he comes in contact with and loves to entertain with his incredible musical talent. Any contribution to aide in his care is very greatly appreciated! He plans to hone his music teaching skills and when he can  use this skill to begin bringing in income for himself again  in order to get a fresh start in life. Landon has also been using this time to grow closer to God through prayer and Bible study in order to continue to grow his faith and gain strength and endurance— not only for during this time  but for the future. He shares his faith freely with everyone as a volunteer minister.Thank you so very much in advance for any financial support  but also for sharing this story and link with others!!! Any shared funds will vastly help at this time  and your generosity is greatly appreciated!10-30-18UPDATE: Hospital bill is $241 491.00 — whew!

I suffered through the rest of the weekend trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and ice packs.  By Monday I was desperate for relief from the pain...I called my daughter and she came to take me to Urgent Care.  There wasn't much they could do for me without escalating the visit to an ER visit  which would 10x to 20x the cost of the visit  and with no insurance  I needed to spend my modest savings wisely.  They did a minimal exam  prescribed some pain meds and strongly suggested I see a GYN doc as soon as possible.The next day I called a GYN and scheduled an appointment for the following day.  At the appointment  the GYN did a pelvic exam and collected some tissue for biopsy.   When the doctor called me on Sunday...I knew it wasn't good news...  (I was eerily calm...I think I was in shock...  I'm not afraid to die  but I'm in no hurry to do so.   I have a lot of living still to do  places to go  things to see  people to meet  lives to touch...wonderful children to spend time with  great friends...and an amazing precious granddaughter to watch her grow into a loving  compassionate  intelligent woman who will change the world...)She recommended I see a specialist asap.  The next morning I was on the phone calling a specialist and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.  Three days later I underwent major surgery (radical full hysterectomy).  Because I had no insurance  the hospital required that I pay 50% of THEIR estimated costs up front  and sign a promissory note to pay the balance within 6 months.  That was half of my meager savings...  And that didn't include the anesthesiologist  surgeon  lab work etc...   At the post op appointment the next week...  I learned my uterus was the size of a cantaloupe when he removed it.  AND it was filled with aggressive stage 3 endometrial cancer which had started to grow through the wall of the uterus.  Yikes!!Now I'm facing chemo  radiation and more chemo every 3 weeks for the next 5 months.  Fortunately I was able to get insurance in place for 2019  which will help with most of those expenses but does nothing for the original medical expenses incurred in Nov/Dec 2018.The bills for the surgery are starting to come in and they are higher than I had expected....far beyond what I can pay on my own  especially since I'm not able to work at full speed right now...  After much encouragement from my friends...I'm swallowing my pride to ask for financial help.  No amount is too small  every amount is deeply appreciated  and anything will help...With gratitude...KarenLet's kick cancer out!!p.s.

Their lives have never been the same. Both were injured  Jeff very seriously. In attempts to repair his spinal damage  Jeff has had 9 major surgeries  10 other medical procedures  and dozens of tests. His surgeons now consider his condition inoperable  and he is on painkillers  which are largely ineffective. In 2012  Jeff was laid off from his job as a lawyer and was denied long-term care coverage that they paid for. The settlement from their car insurance company ($87 000) did not cover their financial losses—over $1 500 000—and did not offer compensation for damages. In the more than 8 years since the accident  Steph has worked full time  and Jeff has not been able to work as he had for 30 years. Steph and Jeff have struggled with home care and with paying their bills. After years of compounding stress  Jeff is now considered disabled. Steph's own health has also paid the price. She developed heart disease and has had two cardiac catheterizations with two stents. In 2018  Steph was downsized from her job as an editor and writer when her company lost major contracts  and she lost her health insurance. She continued with COBRA care coverage for 18 months  but that has ended. While she was waiting for her Virginia health insurance from the Affordable Care Act to come through  Steph found herself in the hospital for cardiac symptoms  exhaustion  and dehydration  which left them with thousands of dollars in bills.In recent months  Steph and Jeff have tried to make some life changes to ease the stress of their lives and find a home that would be less expensive and easier for them to manage  possibly in another city. They are under pressure to move  because they are currently renting and their landlord may sell their home in the hot Alexandria housing market. Their housing search in Northern Virginia and elsewhere has not gone as they had hoped  and they are in extreme distress. While they are looking for a new place to live  Jeff and Steph must also contend with medical bills  high-cost health insurance  moving costs  Steph's ongoing job search  and concerns for the future of their two beloved cats  Callie and Dorian. Jeff fell in their home last week and is recovering from a swollen right knee. Steph is not currently driving and has lost 20 pounds in 1 month. They are at their lowest low.We are asking that you donate money to give Steph and Jeff a break from some of their financial load  to help them find ways to lighten their burdens of care and stress  and to give them some glimmer of hope for a turnaround. Steph and Jeff are kind and generous people who have given their talents  money  and energy to their families  friends  neighbors  and their communities in Alexandria and in other cities for many years. In addition to volunteering with ESL students at Key School in Arlington and as adoption counselors with King Street Cats in Alexandria  they both volunteered at Alexandria's Carpenter's Shelter. At Carpenter's Jeff has done pro bono legal work with residents  and Steph was named to the Volunteer Wall of Honor in 2018 for her work helping more than 120 people over the years find work and housing. Steph and Jeff have been there for so many other people their whole lives long. They are now in dire need of the kind of love and support they have given others. Donations are one way you and yours can help. Other ways to help are to help them find a new place to live (ideally one story) in Alexandria  the DC Metro area  or possibly another city. Another is to help Steph get a new editor/writer job or freelance work.

But over the last 8 months Chris has been dealing with cognitive issues from Frontal Lobe Damage caused by neurological issues. He has cognitive/memory problems  trouble with his balance and has had many falls and spills. On December 30th  I found Chris at the bottom of the stairs. He had been unconscious. He couldn't stand on his own or complete a sentence.  He had collapsed due to a subdural bilateral hematoma.  On NYE   he had emmergency surgery to release the pressure and to drain the blood from his brain.  On Jan 2nd  Chris had his second surgery to install a tube that would better drain the blood from his brain.  Chris will be in the hospital for at least a week and approximately 2 weeks in a rehab facility.  While we do have health insurance  it will not come close to covering all of the bills.  We hate to have to ask for help but it is beyond our means to cover these medical costs.  If you are able  we would be forever grateful for any help you are able to give.   The road to recovery is going to be a long and tedious one for Chris but we hope to see this \"Cowboy\" smiling again!  We both thank you for all your support during this difficult time. ****We are blown away by the amount of support.

"Medical","March 16, 2019","Help Hubert Pinder Win His Cancer Battle","$8,565","$35,000","77","1","77","354","ACWORTH","GA","In June  2017  Green Turtle Cay’s Hubert (“Hubie”) Pinder received the news nobody wants to hear. At 72  he was diagnosed with colon cancer. Though the disease had already touched many members of his family – and taken the lives of his sister  nephew and niece – Hubert was ready and determined to fight. After surgery to remove the cancer  he began a year-long course of chemotherapy. Fortunately  his treatment was in pill form  meaning that in between his quarterly check-ups in Nassau  Hubert was able to return home to Green Turtle Cay. At the end of his treatment  Hubert received the news we had all hoped for. No sign of cancer remained. He was cured. His doctors warned  however  that there was always a chance the cancer would reappear. Six weeks ago  during Hubert’s quarterly check-up  doctors discovered that his cancer has not only returned  at an aggressive rate  but has spread to his stomach lining. So  on Monday  March 18th  he will undergo surgery to have a chemotherapy port inserted. Once the area around the port has healed  Hubert will begin a more intensive course of chemo  which may require him to remain in Nassau for extended periods of time. Unfortunately  for many Bahamians  private health insurance is prohibitively expensive. And though Hubert remains positive and upbeat  the reality is that his surgery and cancer treatment will cost him tens of thousands of dollars. To get the care he needs  he’ll need to pay out-of-pocket for doctors  nurses  x-rays  scans  chemotherapy and much more. On top of that  he’ll have expenses related to his travel to Nassau  and meals and transportation while he’s there. Due to his illness  Hubert has had to close his popular Green Turtle Cay business  Hubert’s Cuts & Curls  meaning his income has been dramatically curtailed just when he needs it most. If you know Hubert  you know how hard-working  kind and generous he is. For nearly two decades  he worked at Nassau’s Head Hunters Beauty Salon. (If you lived in Nassau between the mid-60s and the mid-80s  it’s highly likely that you or your Mom and grandmother – or as in many families  all three -- were among his extensive clientele.) Since 1985  when Hubert returned home to Green Turtle Cay and opened Hubert’s Cuts & Curls  he’s been a much-loved member of our community. Whether feeding the local stray cats  helping raise funds for the town’s annual fireworks display  or discreetly lending support to family members and friends in need  Hubert has always been there for others. And now it’s our turn to be there for him. This page has been established by Hubert’s family and friends to help pay for his treatment and expenses  and to give him the peace of mind he needs to focus all his energy on getting well. We hope you’ll help by making a donation and by sharing this page with anyone who might be able to help. And if you’re so inclined  please send up a prayer or send along positive  healing thoughts for Hubert as he faces this fight."

They believe they can handle the stress of watching their child go through major surgery  but any support that will help the parents worry less about financing this rare surgery will undoubtedly be appreciated. Knowing this family  I am sure they will be extremely grateful for any support; they are regular working people who would never ask others for money.  Unfortunately  this surgery and associated costs will most likely wipe out their savings  emergency fund  & possibly more. That’s why we wanted to set this up for them.  They don’t expect anything and will be forever grateful for any donation. Brooke recently went through her own health issues with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. She had her thyroid removed and is doing well.  So  the family has had some other recent stressors and had extensive medical expenses in 2018 as well.Any donation is greatly appreciated!  Regardless of whether you are able to donate or not please keep this family in your thoughts and prayers.Please pass this along to anyone who may not be on Facebook.  Thank you for your support for this family during this challenging time."

She had just finished the previous year with some huge wins as a stylist and couldn’t wait to start the new year off with that momentum. On Tuesday January 8th  that came to a temporary halt. She had a reaction to a medication which caused a seizure  and mini stroke. Her stroke is so rare that only 5 000 people a year get diagnosed. After over a week in the hospital being monitored  she is now on the slow road to recovery. She is expected to make a full recovery with monitoring and medications  but because her clot is very extensive it will be about 6-12 months before she is totally in the clear. She is eager to get back to her normal life of working  going to the gym  and being able to drive. As you may or may not know if you have a seizure in the state of Michigan you cannot drive for six months. So  on top of medical expenses  and continued doctors’ appointments  when family and friends aren’t available for transportation  she must use a ride sharing service  which can cost anywhere from $5-$20 per ride. On the outside  you may not realize the effects this had on Valerie. While she is still her loving  bubbly  talented self  she is also dealing with managing side effects of medications and trying her best to get back into a routine to the best her body will allow. The clot is still present so she must be extremely careful and keep the pressure down in her brain. Being the sole provider for herself  I’m sure you can imagine how challenging it is to still be making money  but at the same time having extremely reduced work hours  and limitations. We are so grateful that she is here with us and a fighter  it’s our goal to help take one of the stresses off her by helping her with some of her current financial burdens. Even with health insurance Valerie is currently looking at $10 000 in medical bills  however with continued checkups  blood draws  and monitoring  that total is likely to rise.  She is a giver both behind the chair and in everyday life. Let’s rally together and give to her in her time of need. Whatever way you can help support our girl Val it is greatly appreciated."

Her name is Lissu Orozco  a single mother  and an ovarian cancer survivor. She was diagnosed five years ago.  During this time  doctors found a 15cm (about 6 inches) tumor in her ovaries  she eventually had a complete hysterectomy  and six chemotherapy treatments which kept her home without being able to work. Despite the long and exhausting experience  tests eventually said the cancer was no longer present. Now after 5 years  my mom’s ovarian cancer has come back.During the emergency gallbladder removal from this past December doctors took a biopsy of the abnormal growth cells and sent them to the laboratory. After a few days  they would soon reveal the tests were positive for cancer. Although my mom doesn’t have her ovaries anymore  the cancer is still considered ovarian since it originated from the same source. The oncologist explained to us that it is very rare for ovarian cancer to come back and if it does it is hard or unlikely to be cured.After several studies  it has been determined that the cancer has spread across a large portion of her abdomen. She will need five treatments of chemotherapy after which doctors will conduct more studies to evaluate the progress and determine if more treatments are needed. Right now  the main objective is to do everything necessary so that the cancer enters a state of remission.The whole treatment is very expensive  and unfortunately; we don’t have the health insurance or resources necessary since we still have hospital debt from five years ago.I don’t know how things will go  but we are trying to be strong and stay positive. I really appreciate and I’m thankful for any help that allows my mom to stay here with me."

Before that happens she will be going through chemo every 2 weeks and also radiation. Today she is going under anesthesia to have a port inserted under her skin where the chemo will enter her body. Kelly's life changed in one day. Her main concern is her health but unfortunately she is in a position where money is also a concern. Kelly is a self employed business owner and her income comes from being at work and grooming as many dogs as she can each day. She works long hours to provide for her business and her 7 year old son. She has had to hire an experienced groomer to take her place so that her and her business partner can keep their business open and successful as Kelly will be unable to work while going through treatment. This obstacle along with a $5000 health insurance deductible and 20% co-insurance is overwhelming. I do not want her to feel overwhelmed by money as I want her to focus solely on her health. I know those that love her feel the same way. Kelly got her first colonoscopy soon after she turned 43. This is 7 years earlier than is recommended. Her cancer is advanced. This feels so unfair as cancer always is. We need your help. Please donate. Please pray. Please send her your loving and healing thoughts. And please get a colonoscopy."

We were happy as a family.  But those times didn’t last long because in 2016 my breast cancer Metastisized to my bones.  It fractured two vertebrae in my neck and there were spots down my spine and on my ribs.  This was devastating news because my cancer now became a Stage 4 (terminal) cancer.  However  I have too much to live for to allow this cancer to get to me.  I have had multiple radiation treatments to several areas of my body and have been going through chemo treatments weekly since my new diagnosis.  These treatments will continue for the rest of my life and are very expensive.  Already this year I have a new medical bill for several thousand dollars.  Life has changed for my family again and I just want my girls and my husband to be happy and not have to worry about money.  My husband has a great job and works very hard but as a result  we are not eligible for any financial assistance.  My family has been through so much and they support me daily. I just need to know that they are going to be ok down the road. How can I know that if I can’t ensure that now? I worry all day about money and often I am up through the night wondering how we are going to pay the bills. I should be focusing on fighting this cancer so I can continue to be here for my family.  That is much harder to do when I find myself always thinking about money and worrying... As it is  this year  expenses have increased but our income has decreased slightly due to the need for additional health insurance for me.  The constant worry is really starting to get to me.  So far  we have to be able to give our children the life that they deserve to have and I don’t want them to feel the daily worry that I have or have to sacrifice more than they already have had to do  on so many levels.  Please understand that I am grateful for everything I have and for everyone in my life and nothing will ever change that!!All along we have been doing everything we could do to keep up with the all the medical bills  personal bills and expenses and provide for our girls but the bills and expenses are becoming too much. I have always been one not to ask for help but when talking to a friend the other day  she said  “Michele  it can’t hurt to ask for help. You will never know if you don’t ask and you don’t need the added financial stress!” I thought about it and she is right. The constant worry and wonder is starting to get to me and the one thing that I do know is that this kind of stress can cause my cancer to have more power. I can’t allow that....All I want is to wake up one day without needing to figure out where the money is going to come from when my daughter asks me to get her something at the grocery store or when the request comes from school for the need to buy a ticket for a field trip.  I want to enjoy life  not take the motions to go through life.  That is what I do now and life (especially mine) is way too short for that.  The amount of worry is too great and I honestly don’t know how to fix things without asking for help.  So  Please  if it won’t hurt you to help my family  we would appreciate anything that you might be able to do to help us.  Even if it is just a $1.00 that you can spare or maybe you would be willing to share my link with your friends and family on social media  All of the above would help.  The more eyes that see my post the more of a chance I have to get back on my feet.  Thank  you is not enough but it is all I can say for now..."

It was around midnight  and the weather that night was cold and rainy  which caused Darion to lose control of the car. The vehicle hydroplaned into several trees and flipped multiple times. After arriving at Culpeper’s emergency room  doctors decided that the injuries Darion sustained were so complex and life-threatening that he had to be rushed to the University of Virginia's Trauma Center. He was not able to move nor feel his limbs below his waist and required a 5-hour surgery to fuse and stabilize his back. The diagnosis was that he suffered a complete spinal cord injury at T11. The next day  his neurologist broke the tragic news that he would only have a 5% chance of walking again. In addition to this devastating injury  Darion also sustained multiple broken ribs  bruised lungs and a broken sternum  which also required surgery. Darion is a bright and talented 23-year-old young man who had just recently gotten married to his high school sweetheart and was planning his future together with his wife before this injury would change their lives forever. Doctors gave Darion a bleak chance for a full recovery and told him he should be lucky that he is still alive. However  Darion’s strength  courage  and resolve will push him harder than ever before to ultimately walk on his own two feet again.Darion's wife and mother had to quit their jobs to assist him on his road to recovery. Darion’s family is raising funds for the ongoing medical bills and his upcoming rehab. Additionally  Darion will require expensive durable medical equipment  beyond what is covered by his health insurance  such as wheelchair-accessible transportation and other home accommodations that will help him accomplish activities of daily living (e.g.  eating  bathing  moving around) independently. 100% of the proceeds will go towards Darion’s road to recovery. Darion is known for his sincerity  kind-hardheartedness  and as someone who would not hesitate to help anyone in need. Darion now needs as much of your support as possible.  We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. May God bless you all."

Oct. 3rd  our wonderful  talented sweet 24 yr old son Landon was involved in a very serious car wreck where the driver side was crushed in by a concrete guardrail. He was knocked unconscious and badly bleeding to death internally. His best friend Trevor held him in his arms waiting for EMS personnel to arrive  keeping him alert once he gained consciousness and all the while thinking Landon might die in his arms right there. Landon had been totally crushed in between the door and the center console. Somehow with a huge burst of adrenaline he was painfully able to lift himself out of that small crushed in car area. Gratefully  no other persons were hurt in this tragic accident. Landon was actually out doing business errands on his day off  in his best suit (and there were no drugs or alcohol or reckless driving involved in the event.) Just a scary  awful  freak  automobile accident.Landon amazingly survived and was rushed to a trauma center here in Austin  Texas (at Saint David’s South Hospital) and underwent emergency surgery to repair a lacerated liver  ruptured bladder  and damaged bleeding stomach  stopping the major bleeding. He also suffered from multiple lung contusions  fractured ribs  severe bruising and other cuts from glass  as well as a tracheal hematoma. His pelvis has more fractures then you can really count  it was basically shattered. Landon was in the ICU trauma unit for a week  then moved to another recovery room for another long week. His mother Tiffany was by his side almost 24/7  the entire time  advocating for very best care & pain management for Landon while in the hospital during this excruciating crisis.Two days later after the first surgery  he went through another complicated Orthopedic surgery to put his pelvis back together with large metal screw pins. Landon has undergone a lot of severe pain  but is determined to recuperate. Thankfully we requested the help of a pain management specialist who finally got the right medication cocktail to help manage Landon’s pain without him becoming addicted to painkillers in this healing process. During one long stretch in the ICU he had 12 different tubes in different parts of his body and was on about a dozen different medications!“Landitty”  as he’s affectionately referred to by friends  has a long road ahead of him as his full recovery will take at least a year. Much of his physical rehabilitation and huge hospital bill are not covered by his community medical care program. His mother Tiffany has gladly made quick life adjustments in order to be his full-time caretaker  but she is not trained in medical rehabilitation. Landon needs ongoing physical therapy  doctor’s/specialist visits  and medical equipment that costs far more significant funds than his familys’ limited resources can currently support.Landon deserves to get the proper care so that he heals correctly and with no extra added pain. Most patients with these types of severe injuries go straight from the hospital to a medical rehabilitation facility   but that was not within our budget and is not covered by his medical help program. Unfortunately his type of care is very expensive and since his recovery is going to take so long and it will add up. The bulk costs are going to be from the first 6 months of his recovery and all the specialists he has to see  the medication costs  and his hospital bill which which will not all be covered and would fall on him to pay. He has just qualified for some reduced cost for rehab  thru a state-funded program  which will help thankfully.We are privileged to have Landon back at home now living with us  his adoring family  to help him thoroughly recover as much as possible  and as soon as possible! Unfortunately our own financial abilities do not match the love and good intentions in our breaking  but very hopeful ❤️ hearts. Landon had saved his money for a long time to come up with the $3 000 cash down payment for his 2004 (newer) used car  since his existing little old 2000 Ford Focus was at the end of its lifespan and had no A/C for a very long time either. He even sold prized possessions to come up with the down payment  which of course he has now lost all $3000 since the car was totaled. Landon had just been at a new job he really liked for two months  working as an inventory manager/vehicle porter for a local big Mazda dealership. Therefore  he did not yet have any health insurance unfortunately.Landon is a super good person and shows sincere interest in everyone he comes in contact with and loves to entertain with his incredible musical talent. Any contribution to aide in his care is very greatly appreciated! He plans to hone his music teaching skills and when he can  use this skill to begin bringing in income for himself again  in order to get a fresh start in life. Landon has also been using this time to grow closer to God through prayer and Bible study in order to continue to grow his faith and gain strength and endurance— not only for during this time  but for the future. He shares his faith freely with everyone as a volunteer minister.Thank you so very much in advance for any financial support  but also for sharing this story and link with others!!! Any shared funds will vastly help at this time  and your generosity is greatly appreciated!10-30-18UPDATE: Hospital bill is $241 491.00 — whew!

I suffered through the rest of the weekend trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and ice packs.  By Monday I was desperate for relief from the pain...I called my daughter and she came to take me to Urgent Care.  There wasn't much they could do for me without escalating the visit to an ER visit  which would 10x to 20x the cost of the visit  and with no insurance  I needed to spend my modest savings wisely.  They did a minimal exam  prescribed some pain meds and strongly suggested I see a GYN doc as soon as possible.The next day I called a GYN and scheduled an appointment for the following day.  At the appointment  the GYN did a pelvic exam and collected some tissue for biopsy.   When the doctor called me on Sunday...I knew it wasn't good news...  (I was eerily calm...I think I was in shock...  I'm not afraid to die  but I'm in no hurry to do so.   I have a lot of living still to do  places to go  things to see  people to meet  lives to touch...wonderful children to spend time with  great friends...and an amazing precious granddaughter to watch her grow into a loving  compassionate  intelligent woman who will change the world...)She recommended I see a specialist asap.  The next morning I was on the phone calling a specialist and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.  Three days later I underwent major surgery (radical full hysterectomy).  Because I had no insurance  the hospital required that I pay 50% of THEIR estimated costs up front  and sign a promissory note to pay the balance within 6 months.  That was half of my meager savings...  And that didn't include the anesthesiologist  surgeon  lab work etc...   At the post op appointment the next week...  I learned my uterus was the size of a cantaloupe when he removed it.  AND it was filled with aggressive stage 3 endometrial cancer which had started to grow through the wall of the uterus.  Yikes!!Now I'm facing chemo  radiation and more chemo every 3 weeks for the next 5 months.  Fortunately I was able to get insurance in place for 2019  which will help with most of those expenses but does nothing for the original medical expenses incurred in Nov/Dec 2018.The bills for the surgery are starting to come in and they are higher than I had expected....far beyond what I can pay on my own  especially since I'm not able to work at full speed right now...  After much encouragement from my friends...I'm swallowing my pride to ask for financial help.  No amount is too small  every amount is deeply appreciated  and anything will help...With gratitude...KarenLet's kick cancer out!!p.s.

Their lives have never been the same. Both were injured  Jeff very seriously. In attempts to repair his spinal damage  Jeff has had 9 major surgeries  10 other medical procedures  and dozens of tests. His surgeons now consider his condition inoperable  and he is on painkillers  which are largely ineffective. In 2012  Jeff was laid off from his job as a lawyer and was denied long-term care coverage that they paid for. The settlement from their car insurance company ($87 000) did not cover their financial losses—over $1 500 000—and did not offer compensation for damages. In the more than 8 years since the accident  Steph has worked full time  and Jeff has not been able to work as he had for 30 years. Steph and Jeff have struggled with home care and with paying their bills. After years of compounding stress  Jeff is now considered disabled. Steph's own health has also paid the price. She developed heart disease and has had two cardiac catheterizations with two stents. In 2018  Steph was downsized from her job as an editor and writer when her company lost major contracts  and she lost her health insurance. She continued with COBRA care coverage for 18 months  but that has ended. While she was waiting for her Virginia health insurance from the Affordable Care Act to come through  Steph found herself in the hospital for cardiac symptoms  exhaustion  and dehydration  which left them with thousands of dollars in bills.In recent months  Steph and Jeff have tried to make some life changes to ease the stress of their lives and find a home that would be less expensive and easier for them to manage  possibly in another city. They are under pressure to move  because they are currently renting and their landlord may sell their home in the hot Alexandria housing market. Their housing search in Northern Virginia and elsewhere has not gone as they had hoped  and they are in extreme distress. While they are looking for a new place to live  Jeff and Steph must also contend with medical bills  high-cost health insurance  moving costs  Steph's ongoing job search  and concerns for the future of their two beloved cats  Callie and Dorian. Jeff fell in their home last week and is recovering from a swollen right knee. Steph is not currently driving and has lost 20 pounds in 1 month. They are at their lowest low.We are asking that you donate money to give Steph and Jeff a break from some of their financial load  to help them find ways to lighten their burdens of care and stress  and to give them some glimmer of hope for a turnaround. Steph and Jeff are kind and generous people who have given their talents  money  and energy to their families  friends  neighbors  and their communities in Alexandria and in other cities for many years. In addition to volunteering with ESL students at Key School in Arlington and as adoption counselors with King Street Cats in Alexandria  they both volunteered at Alexandria's Carpenter's Shelter. At Carpenter's Jeff has done pro bono legal work with residents  and Steph was named to the Volunteer Wall of Honor in 2018 for her work helping more than 120 people over the years find work and housing. Steph and Jeff have been there for so many other people their whole lives long. They are now in dire need of the kind of love and support they have given others. Donations are one way you and yours can help. Other ways to help are to help them find a new place to live (ideally one story) in Alexandria  the DC Metro area  or possibly another city. Another is to help Steph get a new editor/writer job or freelance work. And please  never  ever text and drive. On behalf of Steph and Jeff and their loved ones  thank you.Rebecca Krafft and Sydney Baily"

He has had a total of 8 surgeries on his eyes to try to prevent further vision loss and blindness. Two of those surgeries occurred last year. He has to have costly injections in his eyes regularly ($1 500 per eye every 2-3 months) and has not been able to drive for many months. Because of his vision problems he is no longer able to work. Even with the best specialists available  they are still unable to determine what is causing continual damage to his optic nerves and continuing to cause permanent vision loss.Judy works full-time and is their primary financial provider and only driver. In May  Jon was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.In June  Judy was diagnosed with Breast Cancer.In August  Jon underwent prostate removal surgery.Judy’s cancer is aggressive  and she started on chemo right away. She just completed her last round of chemo  and she is scheduled for surgery in November. After surgery  she will begin radiation for 5-6 weeks. Following radiation she will continue with very costly ($4800/per treatment) targeted drug therapy every 3 weeks for about another year. Thankfully they do have medical insurance  but even with that they have exhausted all of their savings with out of pocket costs and expenses.  Judy has continued to work full time even through cancer treatment. It is necessary in order for them to have income and also to maintain health insurance.  They live a modest lifestyle within their financial means  and as they look toward the New Year they recognize that their portion of patient responsibility for insurance will be reset and they will need to quickly be able to come up with enough money to pay deductibles and make co-payments for their necessary treatments.They would wholeheartedly agree that the most powerful way we can support them is through prayer!

Like the truck stop  it’s part of the Fort Hall Reservation in southeastern Idaho.Amos Phillips sustained broken facial bones and a brain injury while parked at a small truck stop on an Idaho reservation.Phillips recalled that the doors of his 2000 Freightliner Century Class were locked as he slept  but an intruder “grabbed hold of the handle and just ripped it open.” After entering through the passenger door  the intruder demanded money.“I said I did not have any ” Phillips said. “He said either give me money or I’ll mess you up real bad.” As the two began to scuffle in the sleeper  the assailant  with rocks in both hands  pounded Phillips’ head.“At one point I had him in a headlock around his neck ” using his legs  Phillips said. “I took my fingers and tried to get to his eyes  but I don’t know if I did or not. It was dark. Then I squeezed his balls. Then I turned him loose with my legs  took both feet and shoved him to the front of the truck and he fell out the door.”The intruder ran away. He took nothing  but left what could be a critical piece of evidence: his cap.Phillips was hospitalized for a few days. Both cheeks and his nose were broken  and he had stitches. Most seriously  he had hematoma – a blood clot – on his brain.His son Erik Phillips brought him home to Camdenton. “A few days later  I started having convulsions  or seizures  because of the head trauma ” Amos Phillips said. He spent four days in a hospital in Osage Beach  Missouri. He’s not sure when he’ll be cleared to resume driving.Fort Hall Police Detective Brandon Tuia said Tuesday he expects the assailant’s cap to be sent to the state’s forensics lab this week for testing for hair and sweat. Unlike simpler forensics analysis  such as fingerprints  with DNA testing “it might take months to get the results ” he said.Unless the suspect has a prior arrest that led to his DNA being entered in a criminal database  there will be no match to help in Phillips’ case. He said he has no estimate of age or other identifying features of the assailant other than he appeared to be Native American.U.S. Attorney Jack Haycock of Idaho will determine whether the case goes to federal authorities or the tribal court. When a suspect is Native American  a case can go to both jurisdictions without it being considered double jeopardy  Tuia said.He says it likely will become a federal case  based on its severity and the assumption that the suspect is Native American  whether proven by DNA or based on Phillips’ word until proven otherwise.Phillips and John Williams  owner of JWE  said they’re frustrated at the slow progress of the investigation.“They seemed to be very aggressive at first ” Williams recalled. “Then it seemed like they did back off a bit. I was calling every day.”Williams said he keeps forward-facing cameras in his trucks that run even when the trucks are parked  but Phillips’ attacker approached from the truck’s rear and exited the same way. The intruder’s approach and exit were caught on a truck stop security camera  but the images aren’t clear enough to help  said Stephanie Afraidofbear  interim manager of the truck stop.The truck stop’s overnight security guard  who mostly monitors activity inside the convenience store  did not witness the incident  she says. The truck stop  run by the tribe as a Phillips 66 franchise  has about 10 truck parking places  she said.Williams said the driver who was sent to retrieve the truck found blood-stained rocks inside and a mattress so bloodied it had to be thrown away.Phillips said he’s concerned about paying for his medical bills because has no health insurance. He is the sole provider for his household  which also includes his wife and her two children  who are in high school.At Phillips’ request  Williams said he’s tried to hire an attorney  but the two he’s called have referred him elsewhere."

In 2016  he was forced to give up the sport he loves so much due to complications stemming from what doctors diagnosed as traumatic brain injury (TBI)  likely acquired from the many matches he participated in.On Tuesday  January 29  2019  Peter went to see his doctor who had previously treated him after his retirement. His blood was taken and he was told to await the results. Shortly upon returning home  his doctor called him and ordered him to immediately go to the emergency room for more invasive testing. I took him to HCMC in downtown Minneapolis where he was then hospitalized for nearly two weeks. He was found to have a bacterial staph infection in his bloodstream that was comprising the effectiveness of several of his organs. Prior to his release he was given a PICC line where he has to inject four different medicines  three times a day  along with 8 other daily oral medications. He’s already missed one month of work and will likely need to miss more. He does have health insurance that will cover some of his medical bills  but other bills are mounting due to his inability to go do his job. All funds raised from the generosity of those who can contribute will be allocated for medical expenses  and other bills in general so he can avoid being forced out of his home while being out of work. This is genuinely a case where literally anything will help and 100% of proceeds will go to aiding Peter in getting back to full health.

Thank you for reading and for your help!My daughter Darya (Dasha) lives in my home country of Belarus. This is where she was exposed to Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe two month after her birth in 1986…In 2013  she was diagnosed with primary Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma  nasopharynx  T4N0M0. In 2013-14  Darya received primary treatment: part of the tumor was resected surgically  the unresectable part was treated with chemo and radiation therapies.In 2016-17  a local recurrence  totally unresecectable  was discovered and treated with radiation therapy (Gamma Knife). However  later the tumor came back: In December 2018  unrelated local recurrence in two locations  upper nasopharynx and hearing tube through the ear  both on the right side  were discovered  both found unresectable. This time  the only treatment available is stereo-tactic radiation therapy which includes a very high risk procedure due to the tumor proximity to critical structures  and the accumulated effect of two prior radiation treatments. This treatment has been deemed technically impossible in clinics where she received her all previous treatment in Belarus and Russia.  The only clinic which has agreed to treat in this case is a UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston  TX). The risk increases with the tumor growths i.e. with time since the recurrent tumor has been diagnosed and hence requires urgent treatment with high-precision radiation therapy  the only option available in this case. Finally  I was able to bring Darya to America and start the radiation therapy treatment in Houston in February 2019. This is the last chance for us and we really hope for the best!Her disease left her unemployed and with no funds. While living in the US I could not add her to my health insurance since she is a foreigner. So I ended up paying the full cost to UT MDACC (currently  about $ 104 000  actual charges already exceeded MDACC estimate shown below) and all associated costs (international travel  living  domestic consultations)  total to 115 K$  out of my pocket. Although I have a job I did not have such funds available even after taking my retirement funds and loaning from my friends and colleagues. Hence “GoFundMe” appears to be our last resort to complete Darya's treatment she has just started. Thank you for your consideration and help!!!Dmitri LapotkoP.S.

"Medical","March 12, 2019","Support Chucky Buckets","$8,055","$48,000","59","1","60","55","ANNARBOR","MI","To know Chuck is to love Chuck.Anyone who has met my dad would agree that he is a fiercely loyal man. He is as loyal to his family  friends  and pets as he is to his sports teams and beer choices. His devotion to his family became more evident than ever 5 years ago when my mom suffered a massive brain aneurysm that changed us forever. At the time  she was 64 years old and in seemingly great health. She went from working full time to fighting for her life. From finding her unresponsive  to months in the ICU  to multiple nursing homes  every single day of the past 5 years has been a battle for her and for our family. (Her story was captured here:  www.welovebonnie.weebly.com .) While many men may have become distant from their wives or families after such a catastrophic event  my dad grew more committed to caring for his wife  my sister  and me. When many of his 65 year old retired friends were golfing and traveling  he was spending his days in the nursing home with our mom. He took this role seriously and was committed full time (seriously... he was at the nursing home from 9am to 5pm  every.single.day.). His positive attitude  nonstop jokes  and unwavering love continue to be a bright light in the darkest moments. With our parents residing in our hometown of Goshen  Indiana  my sister in Denver  and me in Chicago  the distance soon become too much to manage. After three years of flights and long-distance care-taking  we knew we needed to move our aging parents closer to one of us. With me moving to Ann Arbor  there was absolutely no way Chuck (who had been chanting Go Irish his whole life) was ever going to step foot near the Big House (there would be no Go Blue in his future) With Michigan out of the picture and Dad on board with the idea of spending his golden years in Denver (read: Golden Years near Golden  Colorado... eh-hem... home to Coors Brewery)  we began the process of selling our childhood home. In the fall of 2017  my sister  our parents  their two cats  and I took a oneway flight to Denver. Within a few short weeks  my mom had moved into a Denver nursing home  my sister had married her husband  James  and they had turned their basement into a \"Poppy Pad\" for our dad. Just when we were all beginning to feel settled into to our new normal  our dad was diagnosed with advanced Stage 4 prostate cancer. This shook us to the core. How had the doctors in Indiana missed this? How could it be that this amazing father and husband  who had committed to spending every single day of his retirement in a nursing home caring for his sick wife  would now have to fight for HIS life? \"The Golden Years\" in Colorado quickly took a turn for the worse  and I truly cannot begin to put into words the physical and mental toll all of this has taken on my sister and me. One sick parent was heartbreaking; two sick parents has become excruciating. For the past year  I've gone through the motions  trying my best to help out from twelve-hundred miles away. I call Acreedo to order my dad’s Xtandi cancer medication  check in on him to make sure he had taken said medication  login to his MyChart to review the latest test results/appointment schedule  and then hear from my sister how difficult everything is... ::Mom doesn’t remember where she is. Dad hasn’t eaten today. We need to file for Medicaid again. Mom fell out of bed. Meals on Wheels is coming  can you remind Dad to answer the door? Dad is in the ER. He can't stop vomiting. Chemo isn't working. Dad's labs don't looik good. The cancer has spread.:: Doctors. Nurses. Scans. Vitals. Health Insurance. Bills. Medicaid. Repeat.Now and again  I forget this new normal isn’t actually normal. Most of my friends aren’t taking care of their parents. In fact  most of my friends’ parents are watching their babies. Sometimes I wonder what that would be like. Sometimes I get so mad. Sometimes I break down crying. And now that I have a baby of my own  sometimes I worry about her having to take care of me one day. And while all of this is hard on me  I can only begin to fathom the toll it is taking on my sister and her husband.When Sara and James selflessly moved our parents across the country and turned their basement into an apartment for our dad  he was a generally healthy and vibrant retired man in his mid-sixties. So while they anticipated caring for our mom right away  they were not prepared to become full time caretakers for two parents  only a week after their wedding. When they were supposed to be living in wedded bliss  they postponed their honeymoon and began meeting with oncologists about what was supposed to just be a \"swollen lymph node\". The past year has been an emotional rollercoaster  with recent weeks taking the cake for being the hardest yet.2019 hasn't been easy on our dad  with more time in the hospital than not. When he is discharged  hopefully this week  he will be released to a rehab facility for OT and PT. While we will continue to pray for his health to improve and him to be able to move back into the Poppy Pad  it may be too unsafe for him to ever return home. Between the stairs in the apartment  the support he needs walking  bathing  using the restroom  eating  and his memory and cognition  the risks may always be too high. On top of this  his oncologist has shared her concern that his body is no longer responding to treatment. If our dad does need to move into a skilled nursing facility  the cost will be at least $8 000 a month. With our mom already on Medicaid  we are hoping to preserve some of my parent's estate to support our mom when our dad is no longer with us. We are seeking support to raise funding for 6 months in a skilled nursing facility.They say it takes a village  and that's true of my family. I want to honor my dad  Chuck  for taking care of my mom for all of the years he was healthy and able; his dedication to his marriage has set the bar high for my own. I also want to honor and thank him for his positive spirit. His ability to see the positive in everything is something that carries me through hard days. I want to honor my sister  Sara  for putting herself second and our parents first. On top managing the physical health of both of our parents  she spends her \"spare\" time making sure they are happy. From researching Dementia games  doing crafts and eating lunch with our mom to spending the Super Bowl in the ER and treating our dad to a Bob Segar concert  she never lets their illnesses stop them from living. And I want to honor my brother-in-law  James  and his mom  Lynn  for caring for my dad like they would their own family. They didn't sign up for this  and their loyalty to our family has touched my soul.It is with the most humble of hearts we turn to friends and family in hopes of alleviating part of this financial stress so we can focus on treatment and healing. Your thoughts  prayers and generous donations are sincerely appreciated."

This then included a bout of pneumonia shortly after that. He was treated at a private clinic and seemed to be getting better but recently he started complaining of more symptoms and as of yesterday he had to be admitted to ICU at the Princes Margaret Hospital in Nassau. Originally he was to have surgery to remove his gall bladder as he had stopped eating and drinking anything for days due to discomfort but because of his current heart condition he won't be able to have surgery until that condition improves. After a series of tests and scans we found out that most of his organs were shutting down putting him in critical care.He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit with a combination of kidney failure and congestive heart failure. His family are with him constantly. As some of you know  because Ramon is deaf  communication is difficult with nurses and doctors who don't use sign language so family members stay with him when allowed to make sure he is understood and not afraid. As of yesterday however he was sedated and recently was put on dialysis to try and restore kidney function. Currently he is not breathing on his own but we are hopeful that this will change over the next few days. We are reaching out because Ramon has no medical insurance to help cover the very expensive stay in the ICU and the continued treatment that will be necessary for the unforeseen future. While we as a family are able to dig in to help we are aware that the hospital stay  doctors and nurses care and medication will need to continue as the hospital works to keep Ramon alive and hopefully functioning on his own. This is his first time in a hospital at the age of 58. We want to ensure the best care possible for him with hopes that he will pull through this time and continue to be with us in the future. At the moment we don't know what is down the road in terms of continued care but we will keep updates coming as we know more. I am Derek Burrows  brother of Ramon. Originally from Nassau where Ramon lives I live now between Mexico and Nassau and occasionally in the US. The funding of this project goes completely to the hospital costs for Ramon's ICU stay and if enough are raised then to his continued care. ICU costs are above $2000 a day and Ramon has spent 16 days in the ICU until he was finally allowed to leave. Other costs include medication and he has  lot of medications to take daily for the rest of his life.  Doctor's visits which are frequent also add a hefty additional cost and as he has no health insurance the costs continue to rise. Ramon  was our father's constant companion  working with him for many years. We would be forever grateful for any help to insure that Ramon gets better and continues a long life ahead.Every prayer  every dollar  every gesture of support is greatly appreciated.With love and gratitudeThe Burrows Family"

As Scott and family was preparing for discharge  Scott stopped breathing  having an episode of apnea. He was quickly stimulated and resumed breathing again; however  after a brief examination it was decided Scott would be admitted to the NICU for observation. Once he was moved to the NICU Scott had another few episodes of apnea and they consequently had to put in a breathing tube.– Scott and his Brother  Liam  at birth  May 2018. –The medical team began running tests and it was quickly revealed by MRI of his brain that Scott had a very large stroke on the left side of his brain. He was placed on a 24 hr video EEG which determined that the stroke had caused Scott to have seizures which were presenting as the episodes of apnea. After several rounds of different medications the seizures were finally stopped  allowing Scott to come off the ventilator. Scott spent 2 weeks in the NICU before being released home.  After coming home  and despite being closely followed by many doctors  Scott had a relatively normal first few months of life getting to know his older brother  parents  and grand parents. It wasn't until his second follow up EEG that Scott was diagnosed with a new type of seizure  called infantile spasms. Scott was immediately placed on a harsh regiment of drugs to try to get the seizures under control.– Scott's first introduction to Mrs. Clause  December 2018. –Over the first year of Scott's life we have seen countless medical visits and consults. Scott's seizures were bought under control with drugs until December 2018 when they returned. Although through the addition of more medications we have been able to keep the seizures at bay and reduce them significantly  it is clear that a medical solution is not possible in the long term. – Scott eating some banana while under going a 24 video EEG at Upstate Children's Hospital  January 2019. –After a visit to Boston's Children's Hospital in February  it was determined that the best course of action and treatment for Scott's condition was to perform a Hemispherectomy. A Hemispherectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is disconnected to prevent the damaged side from interfering with the development and function of healthy side. After undergoing more evaluations and tests Scott's surgery has been scheduled for April 2019.– Scott and Mommy preparing for the baby MEG at Boston's Children's Hospital  March 2019. –Through Kayla's employment as a resident at Upstate Hospital in Syracuse  NY  the family has been blessed with a good health insurance plan which has covered a good portion of Scott's medical bills. However the deductibles  co-pays  travel costs  and incidentals have begun to add up and the family is asking for any help that might be available from family and friends.We ask  if you have the ability  that you might consider a small donation that would be used to help pay for Scott's Doctor's visits  medications  therapies and getting him to and from the various hospitals and appointments.

As Scott and family was preparing for discharge  Scott stopped breathing  having an episode of apnea. He was quickly stimulated and resumed breathing again; however  after a brief examination it was decided Scott would be admitted to the NICU for observation. Once he was moved to the NICU Scott had another few episodes of apnea and they consequently had to put in a breathing tube.– Scott and his Brother  Liam  at birth  May 2018. –The medical team began running tests and it was quickly revealed by MRI of his brain that Scott had a very large stroke on the left side of his brain. He was placed on a 24 hr video EEG which determined that the stroke had caused Scott to have seizures which were presenting as the episodes of apnea. After several rounds of different medications the seizures were finally stopped  allowing Scott to come off the ventilator. Scott spent 2 weeks in the NICU before being released home.  After coming home  and despite being closely followed by many doctors  Scott had a relatively normal first few months of life getting to know his older brother  parents  and grand parents. It wasn't until his second follow up EEG that Scott was diagnosed with a new type of seizure  called infantile spasms. Scott was immediately placed on a harsh regiment of drugs to try to get the seizures under control.– Scott's first introduction to Mrs. Clause  December 2018. –Over the first year of Scott's life we have seen countless medical visits and consults. Scott's seizures were bought under control with drugs until December 2018 when they returned. Although through the addition of more medications we have been able to keep the seizures at bay and reduce them significantly  it is clear that a medical solution is not possible in the long term. – Scott eating some banana while under going a 24 video EEG at Upstate Children's Hospital  January 2019. –After a visit to Boston's Children's Hospital in February  it was determined that the best course of action and treatment for Scott's condition was to perform a Hemispherectomy. A Hemispherectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is disconnected to prevent the damaged side from interfering with the development and function of healthy side. After undergoing more evaluations and tests Scott's surgery has been scheduled for April 2019.– Scott and Mommy preparing for the baby MEG at Boston's Children's Hospital  March 2019. –Through Kayla's employment as a resident at Upstate Hospital in Syracuse  NY  the family has been blessed with a good health insurance plan which has covered a good portion of Scott's medical bills. However the deductibles  co-pays  travel costs  and incidentals have begun to add up and the family is asking for any help that might be available from family and friends.We ask  if you have the ability  that you might consider a small donation that would be used to help pay for Scott's Doctor's visits  medications  therapies and getting him to and from the various hospitals and appointments.

My name is Addi Steinert  and I’m creating this page on behalf of my mom  Becki Steinert  to share her story. In one moment a person’s life can change! My family’s and  most of all my mom’s   did the day we found out she has lung cancer. It all started just a little over a month ago. My mom started having a minor pain in her lung. This prompted a doctor visit to Cass Lake over the holidays  where a lesion on her right lung was discovered. This required a biopsy for suspected lung cancer. The biopsy was positive and confirmed by a follow-up appointment with Dr. Jerry Johnson at St. Luke’s in Duluth on January 10th. The diagnosis: small cell lung cancer.  For those of you who aren’t familiar  small cell lung cancer is an aggressive type of cancer that is not the type of cancer that can be cut out surgically. Unfortunately  the only treatment is advanced chemotherapies. Since the diagnosis   it’s been scheduling MRI’s and PET scans to figure out the severity of the illness. Thank God  the MRI on Mom’s brain confirmed the cancer has not spread there! Great news! But we have a long battle ahead of us. We currently are working on obtaining health insurance to help with the medical expenses  but  as of now  she doesn’t have it. We know there will be many trips back and forth to Duluth for treatment and doctor appointments. My mom is a fighter  and we have faith  but the cost of treatment and expenses has caused a lot of stress. My family and I graciously ask for any support you can offer to help a woman who would give the shirt off her back to help someone in need as she fights the big fight! We are grateful for any donation.  Thank you and God Bless!"

After a recent surgery failed to resolve his heart issues his doctors advised that a heart transplant is necessary for him to have any quality of life. The funds raised will go toward medical  travel  and housing expenses.Full details of Fernando’s health journey: In 1989  at the age of 19  Fernando was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma. Aggressive chemotherapy & radiation treatments led to the destruction of his heart. He was in remission until 1993 when the same form of cancer returned. From 1993 through 2004 Fernando had period of good health where he was able to enjoy life.  However in 2004 he started not feeling well and was in & out of the hospital for a couple years.  In 2006 he was diagnosed with heart disease and had an emergency triple bypass. He was in the hospital for over a month. He was released only to return 3 days later and was diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation and needed a pacemaker. Ever since then  Fernando had numerous doctor appointments  ER visits  and hospital stays. This past year  2018  he was battling fluid retention and his doctors had not pinpointed a cause. His health has been in a downward spiral.  In November 2018 he was told that he needed tricuspid valve replacement because the pacemaker lead penetrated the tricuspid valve.  His doctors hoped that the valve replacement would increase Fernando's quality of life. Finally on January 14th  2019 he had surgery to replace the tricuspid valve.  additional pacemaker work done due to the previous valve surgery damage. After being released from the hospital  Fernando was re-admitted February 1st. Doctors had determined that his heart failure was more advanced than anticipated and the surgery did not provide any relief.   Fernando has been denied Short Term Disability due to pre-existing health conditions.  Since he is not able to work he is on an unpaid leave of absence and unable to pay for health insurance. Fernando's wife  Jennifer  has been on disability since 2000 due to her own battles with cancer and epilepsy. She is unable to work to contribute to the financial needs of the family. The constant stream of medical costs over the years has been devastating to the family and our hope is that this fundraiser will provide the Armijo Family with resources necessary to pay the costs associated with medical expenses (hospital  heart transplant  prescriptions  occupational/physical/cardiac/speech therapy  and a home health nurse) as well as travel and housing expenses. Any contributions are greatly appreciated! We know that the Armijo Family  which includes his wife and 2 sons  will be truly grateful for the help in their time of need."

"Medical","December 15, 2018","Help Dee Survive &amp; Thrive - Diedra Brooks Lanphear","$7,650","$45,000","77","4","70","330","DURHAM","NC","We are raising funds for my wife Diedra to continue pursuing alternative treatments against her stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer. These treatments have been and will continue to be instrumental to her survival  but are not covered by health insurance. Dee  as she is known to many  is really struggling right now and has been battling her ovarian cancer and it's recurrences since 2005. Dee is a joyful person who loves and embraces life. Dee is a spiritual person  a person of faith  ever optimistic and cheerful  and always lifts up and lends a hand to others. She is the sweetest person with the sweetest soul I have ever met. People that meet her often comment that she is a ray of sunshine that lights up the room she is in. Dee is a voracious reader and has done much research on her illness and has employed many natural and alternative therapies in addition to conventional medicine. Now she must re-double her efforts as the cancer that has recurred for the fourth time is inoperable  has and will require more and ongoing alternative therapies to shrink and eradicate it.  Dee's first diagnosis and major surgery were at Christmas in 2005. Since conventional chemotherapy and radiation were not proven effective against Dee's particular clear cell cancer  she sought both conventional and alternative treatment at Dr. James Forsythe's integrative oncology practice in Reno  Nevada in 2006. Dee was six years removed from that initial diagnosis  surgery  and treatment  when in early 2012 during her career as an international flight attendant with American Airlines  she became ill in London soon after working a trip from her beloved New York City base. After days of being too ill to travel and being confined to her hotel bed in London  she was finally able to fly as a passenger and return to our home in Durham  North Carolina. Unfortunately  tests revealed the severity of her illness  that being a mass in her abdomen that had perforated her colon and caused an infection and internal bleeding. In March of 2012 after five hours of surgery  the mass and a portion of her colon and small intestine were removed and it was diagnosed as a Stage IV recurrence of her ovarian cancer. Needless to say after a leave of absence she had to medically retire as the cancer precluded her return to flying and working. She returned to Dr. Forsythe in Reno  we invested in expensive but extensive testing to identify the most effective treatments to her particular cancer and we employed those therapies designed to build her immune system to combat any random cancer cells left behind from the surgery. Unfortunately and more than three years later in the fall of 2015  symptoms and a CT scan revealed a 2nd recurrence of her ovarian cancer in the form of another abdominal mass. Two weeks after receiving and amidst processing this news  Dee slipped and fell breaking her right arm at the shoulder. Dee was incapacitated without the use of her dominant arm for some months while determining the best course of action to deal with this 2nd recurrence. Having met and befriended members of a foundation for healing from Basel  Switzerland  on our return to New York during our last vacation in May of 2015  Dee pursued the alternative treatment suggested in hopes of building her immune system to fight the cancer and to shrink the mass. She traveled in January of 2016 to a clinic on the Baltic sea in Travemunde  Germany and received three weeks of intensive treatments via the clinic doctor and other members of the healing team. It was also unfortunate that my father  Dee's father-in-law (whom we cared for since the passing of my mother from glioblastoma cancer of the brain in 2006) was diagnosed with terminal lung and bladder cancer shortly thereafter. Our care for him precluded our complete focus on Dee's health  as his surgeries and hospitalizations both preceded and followed Dee's hospitalization and her very complicated and delicate six and a half hours of surgery to remove the mass and more of her bowel in September of 2016. The surgery was performed by Dr. Karyn Stitzenberg of the Lineberger Cancer Center at UNC Medical Center - Chapel Hill.After my father's passing in 2017  Dee's CT scan just before Thanksgiving in November of last year revealed a new abdominal mass. Dr. Stitzenberg again performed a complicated surgery to remove the mass and a portion of her duodenum and stomach that the tumor had attached to. Unfortunately  Dee had to spend another Christmas in the hospital and a longer recovery time  but we were grateful for another successful surgery.A CT scan at the end of July this year indicates that another mass has formed and it's proximity to vital organs and vessels precludes surgery. That was a shock but despite being inoperable  Dee as always is steadfast  resolute and optimistic she can beat this and shrink this tumor via alternative treatments. After experiencing severe abdominal pain resulting in a trip to the ER in August  another CT scan showed the mass was growing   compressing her stomach and bowels and causing a partial bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the hospital. Following her release  having already researched and with a trusted friend's recommendation and first hand account of numerous success stories with cancer treatment  Dee went to Bavaria in September for three weeks of intensive treatments and infusions (highlighted by local thermotherapy treatments to the area of the cancer  as described on the clinic's website) with Dr. Alex Weber at the private in-patient clinic for integrative medicine   www.klinik-marinus.com . Dee stayed for the fourth week of treatment as ultrasounds indicated the hyperthermia treatments were arresting the growth of her mass and the clinic provides such a healing environment  as is evidenced by accessing the link to their website above. Dee was too weak to climb stairs when she arrived at the clinic  but by the third week was walking daily on the paths in the meadows around the clinic and was even well enough to do some sight-seeing in nearby Kufstein and Salzburg  Austria at the end of her stay. Although we bought out Dee's retirement to fund a majority portion of the approximately $24 000 cost of the initial four weeks of treatment at the clinic  we used a credit card to pay the balance upon leaving the clinic after her last day of treatment on October 15th. Many of the clinic's patients return time and again for the beneficial \"maintenance\" of the treatments. It was like night and day for how Dee looked and felt from arrival to departure from the clinic. We always envisioned her returning at some point next year  but are now considering a return as early as January 7th. After six weeks of renewed vibrancy being home from the clinic  Dee experienced complications  namely acute nausea and vomiting causing pronounced weight loss and weakness. A recent CT scan and cancer markers in her blood work preceding a hospital stay again last month indicated the mass has started to grow again and is further compressing her stomach and bowels. Dee was readmitted to the hospital again last week after renewed nausea and other complications were attributed to hypercalcemia  an elevated level of calcium in her blood. After treatment for dehydration and the hypercalcemia  Dee was able to keep soft foods and liquids down again and was released from the hospital on Saturday. We are now formulating our plan of attack to stabilize Dee's symptoms and to stop and shrink the mass. By employing the diet and nutrition plans of the likes of Chris Wark and Dr. Schultz  and by pursuing any and every measure of alternative treatments locally  such as vitamin and mineral infusions and ozone therapy  we hope to rebuild Dee's strength to allow a return to the healing environs of the Klinik Marinus am Stein in Germany in the New Year! Hopefully like below  she will be able to play hymns on the piano in the dining room for her fellow patients again in 2019! Although we have been reluctant to this point to ask for  expect or accept any help other than the continued prayers  well wishes and the positive words of encouragement that lift Dee up...any donations will help to defray some of the costs of the treatments she has already received and perhaps will help Dee to be able to pursue the additional and ongoing alternative treatments she will need moving forward!Thank you for your encouragement and support of our darling Dee!           May God Bless You!  Brad Lanphear"

To many  it is the name of their genuine  immensely-thoughtful and fun friend who has experienced many setbacks in her lifetime but still manages to keep a smile on her face through them all. To others  it means sister  daughter  or fiancée.In 2016  after months of doctors visits and not being able to work in the garage  Sofi was diagnosed with and treated for an autoimmune disease called ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the nature of the disease  she was unable to absorb any nutrients from the food that she consumed and could not function for more than 10 minutes at a time without feeling the need to pass out  while also dealing with constant excruciating abdominal pain. Any time she has a flare up  this causes her to be laid up in bed for months and takes a couple more month to gain her strength and stamina back. Although she is currently in remission  she still experiences significant relapses in periods of high stress and is required to take medication for the rest of her life  while still being constantly threatened by an increased risk of colon cancer or the eventual need for one of many surgical procedures to remove her colon entirely.Stem cell transplant therapy has been identified as an effective method of improving the quality of life of people with UC and reducing many of the aforementioned risks. Due to regulations in the US on such treatments  Sofi is forced to explore options outside of the country that are not covered by health insurance. This amounts to an approximate out-of-pocket cost of nearly $30 000.Though she is always donating thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars for charity  Sofi has never once asked for help with her own mishaps  so we think it is time for us to step up and help her. She will be immensely grateful for every little bit that you are able to provide!"

She was scheduled for an appointment on 12/18 with a surgeon at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle to discuss surgery. In the past few days pain has increased a lot and it seems to have progressed a lot for the worse  so we are hoping they will schedule the surgery for as soon as possible. We will post updates here as we know more.Help With ExpensesObviously Nancy is not able to work during this time and it will likely be a lengthy process. She has health insurance and we are still waiting to find out what exactly it will pay for or not. In any case  the expenses will rack up and will likely be in the many thousands. If you know Nancy  you know that while she has never had much  she has always given to others freely. She is not currently set up with savings to handle a situation like this. As her children  we are pulling together to cover whatever needs to be covered  and upon encouragement by several close friends we decided to put together this GoFundMe as a way for our friends and community to take part. About NancyNancy moved to Orcas Island in 1997 from Seattle and has lived in the islands ever since  while spending some years on Lopez before returning back to settle on Orcas. She is a mom of four  a grandma  and a \"Nana\" to many island youth. She is a caregiver  a midwife  a gardener  and a musician. If you live on Orcas Island you may know Nancy as the \"Marimba Lady\". That's because she has played and taught marimba music in the islands for the past 20 years. For many years it was a common occurrence on Orcas to hear marimba music resonating out from the town park. Nancy's signature during a performance is always to convince a random person from the audience to come up and learn to play on the spot  and which point she'll teach them a part and they'll be performing with the band in no time!\"Family-style\" Marimba in the parkNancy with baby Ruby 28 years ago.---With Gratitude Learner  Ruby  Lucas and Davis"

She has spent her adult life working outdoors as an organic  farmer and an organic gardener and landscaper creating incredible beauty throughout the Berkshires. Theresa is proud and strong and fiercely independent and is terribly uncomfortable that we are doing this for her. In 1992 at the age of 25 Theresa not only had a new baby but was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. After 18 months of multiple forms of chemo plus radiation she went in to remission. 27 years later those life saving treatments came back to haunt her with devastating consequences. In August 2018 Theresa was diagnosed with a form of breast cancer now known to be a direct result from the scatter effects of the radiation. Having had a lifetime dose of radiation in 1992 a lumpectomy and radiation were not an option. Theresa had a bi lateral mastectomy in October 2018. Just prior to the surgery she was also diagnosed with Tachycardia which can be life threatening and has gotten worse since the surgery.  Symptoms include racing heart  fatigue  pounding headaches and blurred vision.  Heart and lung damage are also some of the long-term side effects from the forms of chemo used in the 1990’s as well as the radiation.  Theresa is part of the Dana Farber Adult Survivorship Program which studies  follows and treats the later effects of previous cancer treatment. Extensive testing and procedures in Pittsfield  Springfield and Boston over the past 4 months have been inconclusive. Until the doctors can figure out the cause and the treatment she is unable to work and must restrict her physical activities. Theresa is fortunate to live in MA and have great health insurance through Mass Health.   Our goal is to raise $25 000 to cover everyday expenses and out of pocket medical expenses and give Theresa the time to have the reconstruction and heal her heart and get back to work."

Tests showed that due to the size of the tumors and some lymph node involvement she is at a Stage 3.  Good news  if there can be good news from this  is that her cancer is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive which makes long term prognosis in her favor.   Here we are 2 months later and 4 chemotherapy treatments in.  My sister has lost her hair and just feels awful.  She is pushing through and trying to remain strong while working and taking care of her two littles.  While she is still working she is missing a lot of days because these treatments leave her absolutely debilitated.  She has 12 more infusions left.  We met with her surgeon last week who says she is making good progress.  She is planning on a double mastectomy Im guessing in August followed by radiation treatments and reconstructive surgery.  I would like to at the very least lesson her financial burden by raising money to pay her deductible  so that she can focus on her mental and physical health.  Nobody ever plans on having cancer and unfortunately health insurance doesn’t cover everything.  Please consider helping in any way you can  no donation is too small and lots of prayers are welcome.  Our family truly appreciates you all!"

Barron  former CIA Disguise Specialist will be doing Callie's evaluation at her appointment in March.   Mr. Barron is committed to restoring identities through prosthetic devices.  He has people travel from China to consult with him.  He has made guest appearances on Oprah  Montel and Botched.  Unfortunately Callie's health insurance will not cover any of this because it is considered cosmetic.  They do not consider the pain that Callie might endure because let's face it.... bullying and ridicule are way too prevalent in our world.  Fortunately  Callie has charisma and inner strength that just blows us away.  We are asking for donations so that Callie can have the ear that she is so excited about by the time kindergarten starts.  The total cost for the ear is $7000.  In order for Mr Barron to begin making the impressions Callie's parents will need $2 300 with the remainder due soon after.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  All of us are forever grateful for any help that you can give ....

Instead of doing what I have always done  quietly powering through and worrying alone  I am doing the most difficult task of my life: asking for help. Will you help me because I am feeling hopeful and overwhelmed? There is nothing more gratifying to me than to help others. In the salon  it has been helping salon guests find and develop their beauty. At Redken  it has been helping fellow stylists  salon owners  and colleagues grow personally and professionally. At home it was raising my sons so they could become the loving  successful  independent men they have become. Now  at home  it is caring for my husband  a disabled US Army veteran  and our dog  BB King  my husband’s service dog. By helping to fund this surgery  you are creating the hope and possibility that I can continue in my career  and be active enough to enjoy my life  my family  and my future grandchildren. I have been suffering physically and psychologically with chronic pain and infection for a very long time… and it is the expert medical opinion that I will continue to experience ongoing pain every day of my life until I am able to access this treatment. After an extensive series of physical and psychological evaluations  my team of doctors and I have arrived at a comprehensive surgical plan which we are confident will provide massive relief to my pain and radically improve my life. My entire care team agrees that it is profoundly urgent for me to begin treatment as soon as possible. We have already spent most of our savings trying to access care. I have been fighting hard to get some of the procedures covered by my health insurance  but even in the best-case scenario I will only be able to get them to cover a small fraction of the treatment plan my doctors have put together. I desperately  urgently need your help! Any help you can give is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this and thank you for helping me. Much love  Jennifer Gonzales (Tully)"

She is also fighting the lingering effects of Lyme’s disease and several other health issues. Jessica has had mysterious symptoms for several years  but only recently has the cause been determined.It wasn’t until May of 2018 that the devastating medical diagnosis of lymphoma was finally confirmed. This was about a year after her husband Jared had taken a new teaching job in Alabama. Their move away from Texas and their extended family had been filled with the excitement of settling into a new community and job  but their lives were soon turned upside down. For those of you who don’t know Jessica Velnosky Painter that well  she is a devoted wife and mother. This diagnosis has been especially hard since her children are aged 2  7  and 9. She became unable to care for her family  and all the responsibility fell on her husband  since there was no family nearby.  Her passion for fulfilling her Godly destiny  and her love for her family  are Jessica’s reasons for living. Jessica has health insurance  but it will not cover all of the treatments that she needs. Since she is fighting multiple health issues  some of the treatments are very specialized  and many of them are not covered by insurance. It takes all of Jessica’s time and energy to follow the healing protocols prescribed. She is determined to overcome all of this and is putting a great deal of effort into doing everything she can—physically  emotionally  and spiritually. Along with the expense of the treatments  they have other extra expenses  such as medical travel  expensive dietary needs  and daycare for the two-year-old. Jessica has been receiving weekly treatments in a nearby state for about two months now. She is definitely seeing improvement and the cancer factors in her blood are decreasing. The swelling in her lymph nodes is going down. We are all very excited to see these positive signs. But the credit card is maxed out and expenses are quickly getting out of control. They really  really did not want to ask for financial help  but to keep receiving treatments and to avoid financial ruin  it seems that now is the time to ask others to help in this worthwhile cause.Please consider donating to this wonderful family. Each dollar will be used wisely. We are fully convinced that Jessica will be made whole and able to complete her mission here on this earth. There are not words that can fully express our appreciation for your generosity. God bless each of you. TEAM Jessica–Melissa Stephens (Best Friend)  Terry Velnosky (Mother)  Debra Painter (Mother-In-Law)"

The medical bills for Danielle will be high  and the best way we can collectively help her is to donate to this fund to help her keep up with these substantial expenses. Health insurance will kick in and help but only after she pays a high deductible  which is causing her more stress at a time when she should be focused solely on healing and fighting this disease. As many of you know  she left the corporate world several years ago to start her own business  so she does not have the support of paid time off or medical leave plan. She wants to be able to keep up her important work with people in recovery as much as she can  and will pay as much of the expenses as she's able to  but every little bit helps. If you could contribute ANY amount - no amount is too small - it would be a great help to her. It's hard to ask for help  and so I set up this campaign because it was done for me when I had cancer  and I know how much it relieves anxiety about keeping up with even daily expenses when your world has been turned upside down.I am honored to be able to help give back to a woman who has given so  so much to me over the years.  Thank you  so much   for anything you are able to donate.  We will update this CaringBridge page with her progress to keep everyone informed.  Thank you  truly  for any amount you are able to give.  We are so very grateful for your support.- Ellie Schoenberger"

"Medical","February 11, 2019","Support Khelse - Journey to Recovery","$7,725","$20,000","84","2","82","242","HOUSTON","TX","Dear Family and Friends that are Family  We write to you today as part of a Private Fundraiser to help and support all of our best friend  Khelse. Khelse is fighting an unimaginable battle to regain her strength. To provide a brief background  Khelse’s journey to regain her well-being began in January 2018 when she was admitted to the hospital for a massive blood clot in her portal vein – a vein conveying blood to the liver from the spleen  stomach  pancreas  and intestines. During her treatment  she was diagnosed with chronic  but microscopic thrombosis (blood clots). As time progressed  Khelse continued treatment plans for thrombosis that included weekly and monthly specialist appointments to regain the strength of her liver and other affected organs  and to understand the long term affects of these blood clots.Although Khelse was on blood thinners for months  she was admitted again to the hospital on Christmas Day 2018 and diagnosed with 5 blood clots  terrifyingly  one which traveled through her heart and lodged in her lung; very often a lethal path. It was clear then that the blood thinners Khelse had been taking were not effective. As a result  she was diagnosed with an extremely rare blood clotting disorder that the hematologist/oncologist cannot specify.For over a week  Khelse remained in the hospital building her health and strength with endless treatments and care plans. Finally  on January 2  2019 she was allowed to go home. Although she followed her physician’s orders without error in an attempt to regain normal life and to fully recover  with great sadness  she was readmitted to the hospital on February 4  2019 in even worse condition than any time before. Today  Khelse is undergoing countless procedures to determine the cause of her current state. Due to the complexity of her situation and illness  the medical team of doctors taking care of her are discussing and even disagreeing over the next steps of her treatment  procedures  and surgeries. Overall  Khelse has undergone multiple operations and will have many more. As we write this  her anticipated hospital stay is multiple weeks and her anticipated recovery time is 3 months.As we can only imagine  hospital stays and treatment of chronic diseases are extremely expensive. Because she exhausted all of her paid time off during her priorhospitalization and recovery process  Khelse will not earn a paycheck during her present time away from work  and does not have Short Term Disability to cover her missed salary. Khelse's last paycheck was $33.00. Khelse is a level-headed  hard-working young woman with health insurance through her employer  Baylor College of Medicine. Yet  even with this partial coverage  Khelse’s medical bills are reaching extraordinary costs. Currently her out-of-pocket expenses total over $20 000.00 and it’s hard to discern the exact amount of her medical bills before she is recovered. To give you a bit of insight  Khelse’s deductible alone is $6 000 which after she is responsible for 25-30% of her medical expenses. She is currently on a number of permanent medications costing approximately $250 per month after insurance and she is required to have multiple doctor appointments ranging from $140-$200 per appointment. She will also be required to have several high dollar procedures done such as MRI’s and CT scans.To make matters worse  because Khelse has been hospitalized and missed work for treatment since January of 2018  her FMLA is running out in the coming days putting her employment and health insurance in severe jeopardy. Most importantly  Khelse’s normal responsibilities remain in the forefront  such as her rent  car payment  and other general monthly expenses.Since Khelse’s second hospitalization in December 2018  many people have contacted her and us with inquiries of how to help her. For most of last year  Khelse silently took personal and financial responsibility of the repercussions of her hospitalization and newfound illness  but at this point it has become apparent to all those very close to Khelse that the financial consequences of this 2+ week hospitalization and 3+ month extensive treatment will be insurmountable. For these reasons  we humbly started this fundraiser for a specific way to help Khelse be able to focus solely on her health rather than the accompanying stresses associated with being in the hospital. In any regard  on behalf of Khelse's family and with all of our heart  we thank you for your continued love and support of Khelse. It has touched her in ways you cannot imagine and truly helps her get through every day of this process.Respecting Khelse's privacy  we request in advance that this GoFundMe be kept amongst those with access to this page. You are all Khelse's family who have loved and encouraged her throughout this inconceivable journey. For now  we ask that you please keep this information off of the general Internet  including Facebook and other social media sites."

She has been recently told by her doctors that she may not be able to continue to work and as a single woman who has worked hard and owns a home  this has quickly become a financial burden. Bills have already started to stack up and without being able to work she also risks the chance of losing her health insurance.

Most of you know them and for those who don't  we will all attest to the remarkable  and selfless people they are. My purpose for this hopeful endeavor  is to ask for help. Something my family  and especially my parents do very seldom. But  with a heavy heart my mom has been diagnosed with Cancer  for a second time. She previously beat a brutal diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancer  about a decade ago. I have no idea how she did it. It was very intense and damaging.  It was extraordinary  how she rose to the challenge  the surgeries  radiation  and chemotherapy  and came out the other side to live a full life to this day. That in-of-itself is enough for one human being  not to diminish the permanent  and long term effects that she has to live with day in and day out.      Even though they have health insurance ( the companies fight to deny her legitimate claims still to this day making it more costly and upsetting) i think we all know the burden finances place on top of the worry of appropriate and adequate treatment. Yet  they never complain(ed)! They just did and do what they have to do to pay and maintain their lives the best they can. My brother  sister and I are going to do everything we can to help  but even we can only do so much to combat the staggering costs  which is why i nervously do this venture so far outside our comfort zones.      If anyone could help  even just a little  not just money  but even a kind message or a share of this  would really go far and be appreciated.

"Medical","December 15, 2018","Help Dee Survive &amp; Thrive - Diedra Brooks Lanphear","$7,650","$45,000","77","4","70","330","DURHAM","NC","We are raising funds for my wife Diedra to continue pursuing alternative treatments against her stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer. These treatments have been and will continue to be instrumental to her survival  but are not covered by health insurance. Dee  as she is known to many  is really struggling right now and has been battling her ovarian cancer and it's recurrences since 2005. Dee is a joyful person who loves and embraces life. Dee is a spiritual person  a person of faith  ever optimistic and cheerful  and always lifts up and lends a hand to others. She is the sweetest person with the sweetest soul I have ever met. People that meet her often comment that she is a ray of sunshine that lights up the room she is in. Dee is a voracious reader and has done much research on her illness and has employed many natural and alternative therapies in addition to conventional medicine. Now she must re-double her efforts as the cancer that has recurred for the fourth time is inoperable  has and will require more and ongoing alternative therapies to shrink and eradicate it.  Dee's first diagnosis and major surgery were at Christmas in 2005. Since conventional chemotherapy and radiation were not proven effective against Dee's particular clear cell cancer  she sought both conventional and alternative treatment at Dr. James Forsythe's integrative oncology practice in Reno  Nevada in 2006. Dee was six years removed from that initial diagnosis  surgery  and treatment  when in early 2012 during her career as an international flight attendant with American Airlines  she became ill in London soon after working a trip from her beloved New York City base. After days of being too ill to travel and being confined to her hotel bed in London  she was finally able to fly as a passenger and return to our home in Durham  North Carolina. Unfortunately  tests revealed the severity of her illness  that being a mass in her abdomen that had perforated her colon and caused an infection and internal bleeding. In March of 2012 after five hours of surgery  the mass and a portion of her colon and small intestine were removed and it was diagnosed as a Stage IV recurrence of her ovarian cancer. Needless to say after a leave of absence she had to medically retire as the cancer precluded her return to flying and working. She returned to Dr. Forsythe in Reno  we invested in expensive but extensive testing to identify the most effective treatments to her particular cancer and we employed those therapies designed to build her immune system to combat any random cancer cells left behind from the surgery. Unfortunately and more than three years later in the fall of 2015  symptoms and a CT scan revealed a 2nd recurrence of her ovarian cancer in the form of another abdominal mass. Two weeks after receiving and amidst processing this news  Dee slipped and fell breaking her right arm at the shoulder. Dee was incapacitated without the use of her dominant arm for some months while determining the best course of action to deal with this 2nd recurrence. Having met and befriended members of a foundation for healing from Basel  Switzerland  on our return to New York during our last vacation in May of 2015  Dee pursued the alternative treatment suggested in hopes of building her immune system to fight the cancer and to shrink the mass. She traveled in January of 2016 to a clinic on the Baltic sea in Travemunde  Germany and received three weeks of intensive treatments via the clinic doctor and other members of the healing team. It was also unfortunate that my father  Dee's father-in-law (whom we cared for since the passing of my mother from glioblastoma cancer of the brain in 2006) was diagnosed with terminal lung and bladder cancer shortly thereafter. Our care for him precluded our complete focus on Dee's health  as his surgeries and hospitalizations both preceded and followed Dee's hospitalization and her very complicated and delicate six and a half hours of surgery to remove the mass and more of her bowel in September of 2016. The surgery was performed by Dr. Karyn Stitzenberg of the Lineberger Cancer Center at UNC Medical Center - Chapel Hill.After my father's passing in 2017  Dee's CT scan just before Thanksgiving in November of last year revealed a new abdominal mass. Dr. Stitzenberg again performed a complicated surgery to remove the mass and a portion of her duodenum and stomach that the tumor had attached to. Unfortunately  Dee had to spend another Christmas in the hospital and a longer recovery time  but we were grateful for another successful surgery.A CT scan at the end of July this year indicates that another mass has formed and it's proximity to vital organs and vessels precludes surgery. That was a shock but despite being inoperable  Dee as always is steadfast  resolute and optimistic she can beat this and shrink this tumor via alternative treatments. After experiencing severe abdominal pain resulting in a trip to the ER in August  another CT scan showed the mass was growing   compressing her stomach and bowels and causing a partial bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the hospital. Following her release  having already researched and with a trusted friend's recommendation and first hand account of numerous success stories with cancer treatment  Dee went to Bavaria in September for three weeks of intensive treatments and infusions (highlighted by local thermotherapy treatments to the area of the cancer  as described on the clinic's website) with Dr. Alex Weber at the private in-patient clinic for integrative medicine   www.klinik-marinus.com . Dee stayed for the fourth week of treatment as ultrasounds indicated the hyperthermia treatments were arresting the growth of her mass and the clinic provides such a healing environment  as is evidenced by accessing the link to their website above. Dee was too weak to climb stairs when she arrived at the clinic  but by the third week was walking daily on the paths in the meadows around the clinic and was even well enough to do some sight-seeing in nearby Kufstein and Salzburg  Austria at the end of her stay. Although we bought out Dee's retirement to fund a majority portion of the approximately $24 000 cost of the initial four weeks of treatment at the clinic  we used a credit card to pay the balance upon leaving the clinic after her last day of treatment on October 15th. Many of the clinic's patients return time and again for the beneficial \"maintenance\" of the treatments. It was like night and day for how Dee looked and felt from arrival to departure from the clinic. We always envisioned her returning at some point next year  but are now considering a return as early as January 7th. After six weeks of renewed vibrancy being home from the clinic  Dee experienced complications  namely acute nausea and vomiting causing pronounced weight loss and weakness. A recent CT scan and cancer markers in her blood work preceding a hospital stay again last month indicated the mass has started to grow again and is further compressing her stomach and bowels. Dee was readmitted to the hospital again last week after renewed nausea and other complications were attributed to hypercalcemia  an elevated level of calcium in her blood. After treatment for dehydration and the hypercalcemia  Dee was able to keep soft foods and liquids down again and was released from the hospital on Saturday. We are now formulating our plan of attack to stabilize Dee's symptoms and to stop and shrink the mass. By employing the diet and nutrition plans of the likes of Chris Wark and Dr. Schultz  and by pursuing any and every measure of alternative treatments locally  such as vitamin and mineral infusions and ozone therapy  we hope to rebuild Dee's strength to allow a return to the healing environs of the Klinik Marinus am Stein in Germany in the New Year! Hopefully like below  she will be able to play hymns on the piano in the dining room for her fellow patients again in 2019! Although we have been reluctant to this point to ask for  expect or accept any help other than the continued prayers  well wishes and the positive words of encouragement that lift Dee up...any donations will help to defray some of the costs of the treatments she has already received and perhaps will help Dee to be able to pursue the additional and ongoing alternative treatments she will need moving forward!Thank you for your encouragement and support of our darling Dee!           May God Bless You!  Brad Lanphear"

To some  it is the name of the founder of GT-Moto  a Dallas-based motorcycle fabrication business born from the desire to generate money (over $50 000 to date) for cancer research  veterans with PTSD  and even helped a local moto-mom raise money to help pay for her medical bills after being diagnose with breast cancer. To many  it is the name of their genuine  immensely-thoughtful and fun friend who has experienced many setbacks in her lifetime but still manages to keep a smile on her face through them all. To others  it means sister  daughter  or fiancée.In 2016  after months of doctors visits and not being able to work in the garage  Sofi was diagnosed with and treated for an autoimmune disease called ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the nature of the disease  she was unable to absorb any nutrients from the food that she consumed and could not function for more than 10 minutes at a time without feeling the need to pass out  while also dealing with constant excruciating abdominal pain. Any time she has a flare up  this causes her to be laid up in bed for months and takes a couple more month to gain her strength and stamina back. Although she is currently in remission  she still experiences significant relapses in periods of high stress and is required to take medication for the rest of her life  while still being constantly threatened by an increased risk of colon cancer or the eventual need for one of many surgical procedures to remove her colon entirely.Stem cell transplant therapy has been identified as an effective method of improving the quality of life of people with UC and reducing many of the aforementioned risks. Due to regulations in the US on such treatments  Sofi is forced to explore options outside of the country that are not covered by health insurance. This amounts to an approximate out-of-pocket cost of nearly $30 000.Though she is always donating thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars for charity  Sofi has never once asked for help with her own mishaps  so we think it is time for us to step up and help her. She will be immensely grateful for every little bit that you are able to provide!"

Thank you for being in this with us. ---The DiscoveryOn Friday December 7th  Nancy went to the doctor after discovering a lump in her side and having very low energy for many days. Upon doing a cat scan it was discovered she had two large tumors (measuring roughly 4x3x3 inches each) in her lower abdominal area. She was told they need to remove her uterous  ovaries  and lymph nodes all around that area as soon as possible. That will likely be followed with chemo or similar therapy  but we haven't been briefed on the options yet. Fortunately the cancer is \"stage 3\" and hasn't yet metastasized to her intestines or vital organs. She was scheduled for an appointment on 12/18 with a surgeon at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle to discuss surgery. In the past few days pain has increased a lot and it seems to have progressed a lot for the worse  so we are hoping they will schedule the surgery for as soon as possible. We will post updates here as we know more.Help With ExpensesObviously Nancy is not able to work during this time and it will likely be a lengthy process. She has health insurance and we are still waiting to find out what exactly it will pay for or not. In any case  the expenses will rack up and will likely be in the many thousands. If you know Nancy  you know that while she has never had much  she has always given to others freely. She is not currently set up with savings to handle a situation like this. As her children  we are pulling together to cover whatever needs to be covered  and upon encouragement by several close friends we decided to put together this GoFundMe as a way for our friends and community to take part. About NancyNancy moved to Orcas Island in 1997 from Seattle and has lived in the islands ever since  while spending some years on Lopez before returning back to settle on Orcas. She is a mom of four  a grandma  and a \"Nana\" to many island youth. She is a caregiver  a midwife  a gardener  and a musician. If you live on Orcas Island you may know Nancy as the \"Marimba Lady\". That's because she has played and taught marimba music in the islands for the past 20 years. For many years it was a common occurrence on Orcas to hear marimba music resonating out from the town park. Nancy's signature during a performance is always to convince a random person from the audience to come up and learn to play on the spot  and which point she'll teach them a part and they'll be performing with the band in no time!\"Family-style\" Marimba in the parkNancy with baby Ruby 28 years ago.---With Gratitude Learner  Ruby  Lucas and Davis"

She has spent her adult life working outdoors as an organic  farmer and an organic gardener and landscaper creating incredible beauty throughout the Berkshires. Theresa is proud and strong and fiercely independent and is terribly uncomfortable that we are doing this for her. In 1992 at the age of 25 Theresa not only had a new baby but was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. After 18 months of multiple forms of chemo plus radiation she went in to remission. 27 years later those life saving treatments came back to haunt her with devastating consequences. In August 2018 Theresa was diagnosed with a form of breast cancer now known to be a direct result from the scatter effects of the radiation. Having had a lifetime dose of radiation in 1992 a lumpectomy and radiation were not an option. Theresa had a bi lateral mastectomy in October 2018. Just prior to the surgery she was also diagnosed with Tachycardia which can be life threatening and has gotten worse since the surgery.  Symptoms include racing heart  fatigue  pounding headaches and blurred vision.  Heart and lung damage are also some of the long-term side effects from the forms of chemo used in the 1990’s as well as the radiation.  Theresa is part of the Dana Farber Adult Survivorship Program which studies  follows and treats the later effects of previous cancer treatment. Extensive testing and procedures in Pittsfield  Springfield and Boston over the past 4 months have been inconclusive.

He is humble and shares his heart openly.  He’s an artist  and a photographer.  He is hardworking and a master at his craft installing beautiful tile for the last two decades.  Our family made the move from Massachusetts to Maine a year and a half ago for a better way of life. This past October  the day after his 42nd birthday  he got the call that a yearly endoscope procedure revealed some trouble spots that came back diagnosed as diffused stomach cancer.  Since receiving this news  Josh has been to a multitude of appointments with various teams of physicians and other medical professionals  all performing many different tests to determine the staging and course of action. It has been determined that it is Stage 4 metastatic stomach cancer. Josh’s treatment plan is to undergo chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer that’s there now.  After the first round of chemo  more tests will be done to determine the next steps.  Eating has has already become an issue and a feeding tube has recently been installed. When he is able to eat  he will be eating according to a very strict nutritional diet plan and will be taking a number of supplements that will hopefully  strengthen his body's ability to handle the strong doses of chemo. He will also be looking into more natural types of treatment. The current plan will be Josh’s best chance at survival. While Josh does have health insurance  he will have to travel to the hospitals that are best suited to administer his treatment. Right now  this means traveling for chemotherapy and other additional treatments  and it is not definite that our insurance will cover the high cost of such treatments  and all the procedures that are an integral part of the treatment plan. We are also looking into treatments in Boston  but again It is not certain that they will accept our insurance  and it would be out of pocket expenses for us.During the course of treatment  Josh’s immune system will be seriously compromised  he will be exhausted   as well as dealing with a myriad of other pains and side effects that come with cancer treatments.  As a result  he will not be able to work. He is a self-employed individual  carrying the weight of his career by himself..  he will not be getting any type of compensation the whole time he is not working and may not be able to actually go back to a construction lifestyle.. This means that Josh will have no way to contribute towards rent  utilities  food  child care  pet care  or any other of life’s expenses.  So  not only does Josh have to worry about getting better  he also has to worry about paying his and his family’s basic living expenses. I have just started a new job in the last couple of months  and while the company has been very accommodating  starting as a new hire with this kind of news  needing time off for appointments  care  etc  will be difficult at times. I will be the only one working through this journey  as well as taking time off to help him. Even with a solid support team behind us it is guaranteed to be a tough road. There is also a very brave little 10 year old girl  who loves her Daddy very much  involved with this! One can only fathom the anguish a child feels while a parent deals with such a dilemma. We will be trying our absolute best to maintain normalcy thru the days  as he will be receiving his treatments straight through the holidays.This is where you can help.  Through your donations  whatever they may be  love  light  positivity  snacks or even a heartfelt “Hey  hope you’re all doing OK!” each of you has the power to give Josh our love and thanks  to be there for him in this difficult time  giving him peace of mind that he and his family will be taken care of while he is not able to do so. Please join in donating whatever you can to help Josh beat cancer! Layla and I thank you all tremendously. It is hard for us to reach out and ask for help  but in times like these  help is needed. Thanks for your support.Love and warmest regards Ilana Dean"
"Medical","November 20, 2018","Helping the Helpers--Kilgore Medical Issues","$7,375","$25,000","47","4","49","76","BEVERLY","MA","Hello!  We’re Jen and Peter Bayreuther  and we know Cheryl and Randy Kilgore because we’ve been walking alongside them as friends and working alongside them as co-laborers in their ministry efforts for over 15 years.  As some of you already know  a perfect storm of serious health challenges and a drop in both donors and the amounts those donors are giving is having a disastrous impact on Cheryl and Randy.  It is heartbreaking to watch  especially as they continue ministering to and helping others around them.   (Please see below for some of the many things the Kilgores do to help others as they also serve Jesus.)  The Need:  After nearly two decades of active ministry  Cheryl and Randy now find themselves at the very edge of fiscal  emotional and physical collapse.  With no reserves and very little extended family  the Kilgores have worked tirelessly to bring hope and help to people in need without ever asking for anything for themselves in return.  Three years ago  they began to experience a series of relentless health challenges that have cost them more than $80 000 in medical expenses beyond those covered by their health insurance. In 2016  Randy underwent open heart surgery to repair a life-threatening defective artery. Earlier this year  Cheryl was diagnosed with endometrial cancer  requiring major surgery and a lengthy recovery period. In between  Randy had two additional weeklong hospital stays  one to address gall bladder surgery and another to clear a blocked colon  Cheryl was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes  and their son battled serious illness that left him without income and work for nearly three months. Will you come alongside Randy and Cheryl with us in this time of need? This is not abstract; it's concrete  meaningful  and life changing. Our goal is significant AND reachable. Your gift of $25 or $2500 brings tangible relief to a family near and dear to all of us.  Our goal is to raise $25 000 to help them cover their medical bills  premiums  automobile repair  as well as groceries and utilities while they are ramping back up.  Smaller gifts will enable them to tackle specific items while larger gifts will help them pay the huge medical premiums and bills still coming in. Actual medical costs are expected to exceed $30 000 in the coming year  so any funds received above our goal will be used to cover those costs as well. A History of Helping: After nearly a decade with a Boston-based ministry that folded in 2006  Randy founded an international initiative  the Theology of Work Project  Inc. ( www.theologyofwork.org)  and Cheryl served as it’s Project Manager.  It’s initial goal was to provide commentary from each book of the Bible on what God teaches about work.  At the same time  the Kilgores founded Desired Haven Ministries  Inc.   an evangelistic and discipleship organization aimed at helping people encounter and know the great love of God  with a specific emphasis on informing their work lives.  One of the highlights of their ministry are writings and teachings from Scripture useful in everyday life.  Because of their own inability to access certain helpful tools because of their cost  Cheryl and Randy have always believed God wanted them to make their resources available at little to no cost so no one was denied access regardless of their personal financial situation.  This sacrificial view  however  has often meant living on the edge of God’s provision week after week even when their health issues weren’t major.Beginning in 2012  God began moving them beyond their more narrow focus on workplace ministry  calling them to spend more time writing for and ministering to the people who find themselves marginalized by organized religion. Of particular importance is their desire not to add to the fighting that presently dominates the public debates on the front lines of culture.  For example  with suicide rates increasing at a dramatic pace  Cheryl and Randy work to address some of the causes for the hopelessness that leads to this tragic action. This includes writing about best care and ministry practices already available  as well as developing new tools to help people cope with mental illness  addictions  anxiety and depression  and other issues of everyday life.  God has also called the Kilgores to provide support to Christians and others in the LGBTQ communities  including strengthening and building new bridges between families split by hard attitudes and harsh treatment by extremists in and out of the church. In addition to new tools  Cheryl and Randy are eager to understand what help is already out there for the people they serve; and and how to build bridges between the people in need and services already available.  Their new website ( www.IntersectionZ.com) not only provides a way for them to write about both the need and potential help  but also gives them a chance to spread the word about volunteer and giving openings that exist  all while building an online community of people who understand the issues and want to help."

We had a very healthy pregnancy that was progressing well until March 28th when Rachel's water unexpectedly broke at 31 weeks. We went to the doctor that Thursday afternoon and talked to them. After running tests the doctors believed the baby had simply pushed some urine out and that all was well  they sent us home with the belief that things would resolve themselves. The next day the same issue of leaking fluid was still happening  so we made another trip to the hospital hoping that all would be okay. Upon arriving in the room  the doctor ran a swab test that immediately confirmed Rachel's water had in fact broken. Following this realization  the doctors started piling info onto us regarding what the next few weeks would look like.  First  Rachel was admitted into OU Children's hospital for roughly two weeks while the doctors have tried to speed up lung development and avoid infection. Steroids have been administered for speeding up the development of the baby's lungs and Rachel was given antibiotics to lower the risk of infection (that risk had gone up since the baby is now exposed to the outside).While these things were being administered  Rachel stayed in a labor and delivery room. There they had the resources that would be needed in case Rachel were to go into labor naturally.  She remained stable during the first 12-16 hours of observation.  Once the immediate threat of labor passed  she was moved to the Special Care section of the labor and delivery floor.  Now she is being observed each day with and the goal is to stay pregnant until she is 34 weeks along.  Once she turns 34 weeks on April 14th  the plan is to induce labor and have our baby.  If she develops an infection or goes into labor the plan is to deliver sooner rather than later.  Either way  the baby will go directly to the NICU to continue development before going home.This leaves us hopeful yet anxious for our first child's well being.  The nurses and doctors here are some of the best  and we know God is watching over us.  However  the financial burden of this unexpected turn is overwhelming and hard to navigate.  We want the best care for our family  but Rachel has left work much earlier than expected and is left with little to no maternity pay.  We know that God will provide for us and that he works in mysterious ways to make miraculous things happen.  Turning to our loved ones for help has been a humbling and incredibly grateful experience.  Thank you for reading this and for any prayers or support you can provide.With everyone's help  we're hoping to raise $7000. This to us is a staggering amount of money. The total is made up of a $5000 health insurance deductible which will help keep our insurance covering 75% of the remaining total instead of dropping to an unknown percent of coverage if we are unable to pay. We had a plan consisting of Rachel working until the end of the school year and receiving paid time off during the summer as self earned maternity leave  unfortunately that plan is no longer viable. Because that plan essentially fell apart and we lost half of our income overnight  the other $2000 is to help with any costs  bills  and emergencies that happen in our day to day lives outside of the hospital  like loan payments  utility payments  car repairs  food  gas  etc. Please let us know if you have any questions that we can answer. Everyone's support  generosity  and aid mean more to us than we can possibly express. -Rachel  Samuel  and Baby Wilson."

Yes  six boys  I always put my families needs above my own and sacrificed long hours to make sure we had a good roof and food on the table. I did not come from money just the opposite a broken home  and we were relatively poor but strong in spirit.  I had the American dream work hard and grow old on my retirement pension. However  that dream came crashing apart very quickly in 2016.Ten years after I retired  from the City of Chicago  whom I worked for 32 years  which guaranteed me 80% of my salary and would provide me with health insurance as part of my compensation in my pension deal. Sounds like a great deal  right.  However  three years ago in 2016 the city made a decision to cut-costs and stopped all health insurance benefits on retired pension holders  stating that going forward we would need to purchase our own health insurance as the city was in a deficit. On a take-home pension of  $50K per year  I now had to front $32  160 per year to cover my spouse and myself for health insurance.  This didn't even allow me enough money to cover my mortgage payment  credit card debt  utility bills  car insurance  and other standard living expenses.To make matters worse at the end of that same year  2016   I was diagnosed with MDS Blood Cancer  which over the next two years morphed into AML Leukemia. The past three years have wiped us out financially  and now the banks threaten to take our house as I sit in the hospital literally fighting for my life.  I now have till the end of April to come up with money to save my house with mounting medical bills  and I am praying to God for a miracle that I may survey this life-threatening disease and still have a home to come to if I survive.If by any chance you have the means to even give a $1 or two and to please share my story  I might actually be able to come up with the funds to stop the bank  so that I can still have a roof over my head if I survive.  Thank you for reading this and God bless you and keep you safe."

Brownsville  TX. High School Spanish class. ... Sitting at her desk  a young Angela spies a handsome Arturo (Art) sitting at his desk  across the room  and it is love at first sight!  She told her 2 best friends that she was going to marry that boy. She had found her soulmate. She can’t believe her good fortune when the two start dating. Over the course of the next seven years  after surviving high school drama and the pressure of playing competitive sports  Art worked many jobs so Angela could finish her college degree  because that’s what you do for someone you love – your perfect match; you are there for them. They were blissfully married on June 12  1998  blessed with their first child and Arturo went on to complete his college degree. In 2008 the family made the difficult decision to leave everything and everyone they had ever known to take advantage of the many opportunities a bigger city  Houston  TX  has to offer. Both Angela and Art were educators in the school system  but had to face the hard fact that education jobs in Houston were few and far between at that time. Despite that  Art and Angela fell in love with Houston and Art could no longer ignore his deep desire to “protect and serve” his new community and proudly became a Houston Police officer. They are beyond blessed to have 4 amazing children;  Alyssa 20  a Junior in college  Audrey 18  a senior in high school  Abriana 15  a sophomore in high school  and Aj 12  a seventh grader.  Art has been their softball coach since they were old enough to swing a bat and continues to coach them throughout their lives.   Fast forward to March 2018. Art now has 10 years on the force at the Southwest Division where he has earned several top performer accolades from his department. Unfortunately  Art found out his kidneys have failed him due to his lupus. He is told he is in need of a kidney transplant ASAP.  Art comes from a family of 7 and even though his siblings offered to be tested  Art strictly refused. Art being Art  he did not want to complicate anyone’s life by taking their kidney. The family and friends who did get tested  unfortunately  were not a match. Remember  Art and Angela are soulmates  a perfect match  so it stands to reason that Angela would be tested. This had to work. After months of being poked and prodded  Angela was a match! Now it is her turn to be there for him. She is able to give her husband  her soul mate  the father of their children  their provider and coach  the ultimate gift - her kidney; because that’s what you do for someone you love. After staring death in the face and refusing to accept its’ calling  Art will be able to continue to serve the community that he loves  be the supportive and loving husband and father he is and live a long healthy life.  The procedure is scheduled for December 17th  2018.  Even though both Art and Angela have health insurance as a benefit through their jobs  being a perfect donor match for your husband comes with its’ own set of challenges; 1)      Recovery time - Art: The family will be without either parent working for a few months. No amount of health insurance will cover the necessary expenses a family of 6 faces every day. This will be a financial hardship like the family has never known before. As many police officers do  Art works extra jobs to help maintain the financial stability of the household and he will not be able to do this during his recovery. 2)      Recovery time – Angela: Due to certain policies at her current job  Angela will not be compensated during her recovery time. On behalf of the amazing Garcia Family  we are asking for any monetary support you can provide.The out-of-pocket expense for this procedure is astronomical. We understand that the holidays are just around the corner  but please consider donating to help this loving family get through this incredibly trying time.

Your kind words and prayers lift us up every day. On December 1st my dad  Gregorio Esquivel  suffered a severe stroke. Initial treatment was timely and appropriate  but still his condition worsened. He was admitted at SSM University Hospital in St. Louis. Multiple scans showed that significant damage had occurred in my dad’s brainstem  specifically an area needed for movement. Due to the stroke  he is currently paralyzed from the neck down. He also has weakness of his head and neck which means he cannot eat or drink by mouth and he cannot vocalize his words yet. We are happy to say that he is out of ICU and is stable. He is completely conscious  aware of his surroundings  and as smart as ever. Gladly  his spirit and sense of humor are intact. Based on the symptoms  the doctors agree that his stroke should be treated as if it were a spinal cord injury. His best chances at regaining movement is by going to a rehab center that specializes in this type of therapy. But the story does not end here:In 1999 we moved to the US from Monterrey  Mexico. For nearly 20 years he has called the US his home. During that time my dad has worked tirelessly  paid his taxes  provided for our family and enjoyed every day of it. He is a good member of his community and a friend to all. In the early 2000s  he began communicating with the Immigration Services to gain citizenship. However  it can take 20-30 YEARS for immigration applications to go through  this includes my dad’s application. They are currently reviewing applications filed in 1998 and 1999. Although he may be lawfully here  he is not a citizen  nor does he have a green card. To further complicate things  he does not currently have health insurance. This is where we are stuck and in the most humble way we are asking for help. If my dad is to accept Medicaid or any sort of government help  his request to gain citizenship in the future will likely be denied. We have been given the option of sending him to Mexico but if both of my parents go  they could be penalized with 10 years of no re-entry. We are working hard every day to find out what options we have available. We are confident we will solve these problems. But the fact remains that my dad is lying in hospital bed and mom remains attached at bedside. My dad is 53 years old and has lifetime of memories left to make. Help us help him. Help us get him the help that he needs and deserves. He has long road to recovery  but we have high hopes and even higher faith that he will recover and together we will get through this."

Unfortunately  short term disability does not provide full pay.  Some of his medical expenses are not covered and with the everyday necessities of life  money is getting tighter and tighter.  Paul is one of the strongest  most selfless people we have ever known and is always there to give his love and support or the shirt off his back to anyone that needs it.   Now  it's time that we send back some of that love and support to Paul and his family.  Thank you for your unwavering love and support. Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated.  Everything we can do to help and surround him with love is what is most important so he can focus on beating this thing. We will do our best to keep you updated on his status.Please spread the word. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts…muchas gracias!Mariana Rodriguez Ortiz"

Some from an aggravating injury at work and a small hernia. He had formed a mass on the upper part of his right leg and began to favor it with a limp. He began to experience pain in his back and met several times with various doctors and a general surgeon. While waiting on word from workers comp and pending insurance approval for a hernia operation  on the morning of September 5th  2018 he was headed out to work but returned home shortly. As he was trying to wake up his wife  he was panting and near collapsed. He was on the floor unable breathe and had stabbing pains in his back. She quickly rushed him to the ER. Being convinced it was a possible broken rib they awaited the results of all the tests. The Xrays showed he had formed a blood clot in his lung and in the some of the scans it showed enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal area. They needed to admit him for further testing and start him on blood thinners. They also suggested this could possibly be cancer. A WORLD FOREVER CHANGED For 8 days in the hospital he was receiving heparin via IV to reduce the likelihood of the blood clot to worsen. More screening tests and scans were ordered. They took a biopsy of the mass on his leg. On September 2  2018 they performed a surgery on the lymph node removing about 1/3 for further testing. Tests were still pending and on Septemer 13  2018 he was discharged with a pending prognosis. They suspected it could possibly carcinoma  soft tissue sarcoma or even possibly rhabdomyosarcoma. On October 2  2018 my cousin went back for a prognosis. Testing was not conclusive so they performed some more testing and had him return on the 10th. It turns out my cousin Chong has has enlarged lymph nodes throughout his entire his body all the way up to one in the neck. It was categorized as a Stage 4 High Grade Pleomorphic Soft Tissue Sarcoma. The worst part is  it is high grade and travels through the lymph nodes of his body. It has already spread to his liver. On the 12th of October he received his first chemotherapy treatment. Last night on October the 16th he was hospitalized as his kidneys gave out to chronic kidney failure and we are praying for a speedy recovery but it seems he won't be able to receive his scheduled his 2nd chemotherapy trearment this coming Friday. HOW WE CAN HELP 1. Prayers are greatly appreciated as there are many studies whether we believe them or not that blind prayers could help in a manner that is beyond explanation. A prayer wont make Stage 4 cancer go away but we can ask for courage and strength so that he can battle the cancer head on. 2. Recently my cousin and his wife bought their first home together. While Kristen has a good job  my cousin Chong is not able to work which has reduced them to single income. Kristen's boss has been more than supportive allowing time off but a fight with cancer isn't a short battle. 3. All money raised will go directly to my Chong and Kristen so that they can use the money to pay for all the things that health insurance doesn't cover. There are many costs associated it with it from something as simple being able to eat in the hospital cafeteria all the way to covering expenses related to every day life. We are not expecting a million dollar donation  but if everybody could give anything even if it's a single $1  a share of the page would go a long way. 4.... hmmm being from L.A. I'm a Dodgers fan  but if the Astros could make it to the World Series and give the Dodgers a good series and then go to a game 7  maybe I would be happy with either outcome since it would lift his spirits.

He’ll also resume chemotherapy. He still has a long road ahead.Throughout it all these past 6 months  John has been positive and inspirational to many of us  as always. He’s going through radiation and chemo  lost much of his hair  he’s exhausted  he’s going through a divorce  but he has continued to make so many of us beautiful by going to Blanc  rocking Moroccanoil  raising his wonderful kids  working out  doing yoga and never letting us know how hard it is every single day.  This GoFundMe campaign is to help John cover his expenses while he’ll be out of work the next few weeks and continuing to recover in the ongoing months.

"Medical","November 9, 2018","Help Jessica Beat Lyme","$6,900","$40,000","45","5","44","149","SEATTLE","WA","We met Jessica during our freshman year of college at Whitworth University. She and Michelle were assigned to be roommates  and I lived next door. We quickly developed a bond that lasted through the ups and downs of college life and beyond. It was the best kind of friendship  one where you could be absolutely honest and ridiculous (as anyone who knew us in college can attest) and transparent and just yourself. Jessica was  and is  one of those rare  beautiful  kind people that is so easy to befriend. If you know her  you know what we mean  and you know how special Jessica is.And that's why we're asking for your help. In 2015  Jessica began to experience a number of troubling health problems  including severe pain and fatigue. She was initially diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Despite seeing many different doctors and pursuing various treatment options over the next couple of years  Jessica's symptoms worsened to the point where she became bedridden. Once a vibrant school counselor who lived a physically active life  Jessica found herself unable to work or even do much to meet her own basic needs. In March of 2018  Jessica learned of a naturopathic clinic in Pocatello  Idaho  that specializes in helping people with similar chronic health issues. The doctor there discovered Lyme bacteria in Jessica's blood  along with other chronic infections. After a month of intensive treatment at the clinic  Jessica's body showed some improvement. Nevertheless  as she headed back home to Tacoma  she knew the road to full recovery would be long and arduous.Since then Jessica has continued to receive treatments from providers in the Tacoma/Seattle area. Although there have been some improvements  her overall health is still severely compromised. Due to persistent nerve pain  extreme fatigue  and neurological symptoms  she continues to live a hugely restricted life. Most of her time is spent lying down. She can only stand or walk for a minute or so before needing to get off her feet. Her vision and auditory system have been impacted in such a way that she must limit the use of her eyes and avoid noise as much as possible. She had to give up her apartment and now lives with her mom who provides care for her. Jessica depends on others to do all of her grocery shopping  errands  food prep  dishes  and laundry. No longer able to drive  she remains homebound and only leaves the house when someone takes her to an appointment.  Jessica now receives frequent in-clinic treatment from a doctor near Seattle who specializes in complicated chronic illness. He has told her that the majority of his patients have seen at least a dozen doctors before finding him. She believes that her new doctor’s comprehensive approach will eventually make a significant difference. This doctor is quite hopeful for her but estimates it may well take 24 months for her to regain enough health to get a part-time job.When Jessica had to quit work in 2017  she initially received long-term disability income that covered her living expenses. Unfortunately  that has since been revoked. She is in her third phase of applying for Social Security Disability Income  but her chances of receiving support through this avenue seem slim. Chronically ill patients often have a hard time proving the disabling effects of their illnesses. The Social Security Administration  in addition to companies that provide long-term disability insurance  want applicants to provide hard data that measures their debilities. Since Jessica’s lab tests have mostly yielded normal results  she is unsure if she will be able to win her case.After three years of pursuing medical interventions and two years of being unable to work  Jessica has run through her financial reserves. Her parents are currently covering her living expenses and have already poured large sums of money into her treatment. And although Jessica receives very limited health insurance  it does not cover any of the alternative treatments she needs  which typically cost $2 000 per month. Jessica is now at the point of needing to look beyond herself and her immediate family in order to pay for ongoing treatment.For Jessica's friends and family  this whole situation has been overwhelming and difficult. Obviously  for Jessica  it's been even more so. But if you have talked to Jessica at all during this journey she's been on  you already know that she's handling all of this with unbelievable tenacity and grace. As she wrote in one of her update emails to family and friends  \"If this health journey has taught me anything so far  it’s that I truly do not need to figure everything out. God holds all the puzzle pieces and I am relieved that I only need to focus on the piece that is currently in my hands.\"So  how can you help Jessica beat Lyme and recover her health? Here are a few suggestions:- If you are a praying person  Jessica would love prayers for this journey. Please pray not only for healing and provision  but also that she would have hope  peace  and faith in the midst of circumstances that feel wildly out of control.- If you have the means to do so  please consider contributing to this GoFundMe campaign to assist with covering Jessica's medical bills. Even the smallest donation would make a big difference for her.- Share encouraging words with Jessica here on her GoFundMe page. One side effect of her illness is that it has isolated her physically and emotionally  so this is one place you can reach out to Jessica to let her know you're thinking of her.- Share this page with others who would benefit from hearing Jessica's story or would like to support her in her journey.On behalf of Jessica and her family  thank you for your support and generosity! - Katie and Michelle"

A professional home inspector since 1999  David has worked with us in St Johns  Duval  Flagler and Putnam Counties for 19 years. A couple of months ago  after having some dental work  David noticed a lump on his neck had appeared. Thinking it was some swelling after the visit to the dentist  he gave it a week to see if it would go away. When it didn’t  his wife Tracy suggested a trip to the doctor for a professional opinion. Although tests came back normal  the physician ordered an ultrasound which showed abnormal lymph nodes triggering a biopsy. The diagnosis came back as squamous cell carcinoma. The doctor thought it could be localized to the left tonsil and surrounding areas so the tonsil was removed. Thankfully  the pathology post-surgery came back negative and the prescribed course of treatment is radiation for a period of 5-7 weeks. 70% of the time radiation is successful and no second surgery is required and we are all hoping this is true for David. He went back to work the week after the surgery and plans to work during his radiation treatment  although on a more limited schedule during that time.David is self-employed which means his health insurance premium is higher than his mortgage payment. Back in August he switched his insurance plan so all the medical expenses incurred since the diagnosis in November and up to January 1  2019 must be paid out of his pocket.For those of you who know David  you know he’s typically the one offering help and not the one asking for it. So we  his friends and colleagues  are asking for him. Any financial help you can provide will be greatly appreciated and will offer David and his family some peace of mind during this holiday season. Your generosity will allow him to focus on beating the cancer and not worrying about how the family will pay the medical bills.All donations will be used solely for the out of pocket medical expenses. On behalf of David and his family we thank you in advance for your generosity and compassion during this difficult time. Wishing you all a wonderful holiday season and a bright new year."

Johanna had just started her new job two months before the accident. This was her first job after graduating with her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). She was excited to close her education chapter and was going to become the breadwinner for her family. After the accident  Johanna has had three surgeries and needs to do physical therapy around the clock or else suffer more damage. At the moment Johanna still cannot walk and is working on regaining knee mobility. The recovery for these kinds of injuries takes over a year and  unfortunately  she has lost her job due to the accident and does not qualify for long-term benefits. Moreover  she lost her health insurance and she needs for physical therapy and care from doctors.  Medical bills have piled up to the ten of thousands and her student loans  car insurance  and day to day expenses will not go away. It’s estimated that she will be unable to work for at least the next six months. Johanna has always given back to the community by volunteering and serving as a mentor. She and her family need all of the help they can get to cover expenses that are currently overwhelming. Your support for Johanna during this time is greatly appreciated and please consider sharing this message. Thank you in advance.Spanish Version:Johanna Heureaux tuvo un accidente donde se rompió la pierna izquierda a la rodilla. Johanna acababa de comenzar su nuevo trabajo dos meses antes del accidente.

Después del accidente  Johanna se ha sometido a tres cirugías y necesita hacer terapia física durante todo el día o puede sufrir más daños. Por el momento  Johanna aún no puede caminar y está trabajando para recuperar la movilidad de la rodilla. La recuperación de este tipo de lesiones lleva más de un año y  desafortunadamente  ella perdió su trabajo debido al accidente y ella no califica para los beneficios a largo plazo.

I arrived 6.5 hours later to find her all bandaged up - basically from her legs down.

She then has to take various hormones  injected a couple times a day  to get her ovaries to produce lots of eggs. During this stimulation phase  there are appointments every few days to monitor the ovaries. After nearly two weeks  the doctor orders a final “trigger” shot to encourage the eggs to fully mature and release. A day or so later the eggs are collected in a procedure done under general anesthesia.  All mature eggs are then injected with sperm and the wait begins to see how many embryos are created.  Following the egg retrieval described above  I will likely need to undergo laparoscopic salpingectomy surgery to repair or remove my blocked fallopian tube.  Inflammatory fluid in blocked tubes can flow back into the uterus and lead to lesser chance of successful pregnancy.  Therefore  the damaged tube may need to be removed to enhance our odds and reduce risk of miscarriage.Once the tubal issue is addressed and I've healed  we will then go back for a Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET)  where an embryo will be inserted into my uterus and we'll pray that it successfully implants.  Assuming the best  we'll then continue for an additional 3 months of hormone treatment until my body is able to support the pregnancy on its own.Unfortunately  our insurance does not cover anything related to infertility.  All medications  surgeries  scans  lab monitoring  and appointments will need to be paid for upfront and out-of-pocket.  Total cost will be around $20 000.Our plan is to move forward with the goal of starting our first round of IVF in spring/summer of 2019.LIVING WITH INFERTILITYBefore 2017  I honestly didn't know much about infertility.  I had no idea that my health insurance would cover 0% of any medications or interventions related to helping me become pregnant.  I didn't know that 1 in 8 couples in the US struggles with infertility.  I didn't understand the deep sadness and loneliness  the disappointment and grief that I would feel.  I didn't realize infertility would rob me of the joy of celebrating pregnancies and milestones with friends and their children  because while I was happy for them it was just too painful for me. Before infertility  I never felt that sting of wanting something so bad but it being just out of my reach. I didn't realize the stress and strain it would cause.  I never thought financial constraints would come into the discussion about having a family.  Before infertility  I didn't realize how strong I was or how strong I could be.  I didn't understand how deep I could love  both those around me and that future child not yet in my arms.  I didn't appreciate how strong my marriage was.  I didn't fully know how deep faith and hope can run.  I learned that infertility doesn't define me.I also didn't realize just how many people would want to help us along the way.THANK YOUIt's said that it takes a village to raise a child - and maybe that starts even before birth.  From the bottom of our hearts  thank you for reading our story  for sharing it with others  and for helping us on our journey to become parents.   Thank you for your donation  as every little bit makes a difference.  We truly cannot express our gratitude enough for your help towards us becoming parents.Additionally  if you or someone you know is suffering with infertility please do not hesitate to reach out.  You are not alone.  It can be hard to know what to say or how to help - we're no experts either!  There is an amazing community of couples fighting infertility out there and I hope you find comfort in knowing you aren't alone  just as I have. Thank you to all of our friends and family who have been with us throughout this journey - every hug  prayer  and act of kindness has helped us through those trying times.  It means more than you will ever know.To say thank you isn't enough - we are forever grateful.Brian & Katelyn"

To the people who know us to the ones who don't  my dad  Pompilio John Sambogna  is a man of many titles including Husband to his loving wife  Father to his three daughters  Grandfather aka Pop to three granddaughters  Friend to all  and small business owner of Pompilio's Pizzeria and Restaurant in the small town of Westwood NJ. He is a warm and welcoming smile and a fist bump followed by light hearted conversation and many laughs to everyone he meets. Always putting everyones health and happiness before his own  he would give the shirt off his back or the very last meatball on his plate(much more important than the shirt to an Italian man) to anyone who needs it. Unfortunately  he may have given too much of himself and was left vulnerable. This past year  he has gone through carpaltunnal surgery  has had two pins put into his left ankle  rotator cuff surgery  and to top it off  after his most recent  spinal decompression surgery  he came down with a very rare post surgical virus called Guillain Barre which attacks the nervous system. Our entire family came together to get him through all of this with all of the love and support we could muster  hoping that the new year would start us off on a healthier less worrisome path. However  a few short months later  he began to see shadows or \"floaters\" and streaks of light in his left eye. Having had been told he had caterax  he went to the doctor thinking that would be the issue. If only it were that simple. Because eye specialists are not easy to come by in New Jersey  he was flip flopped from one doctor to the next being poked and prodded  until he was given the recommendation for the best eye specialist in New York City.Today  at that visit  my father was diagnosed with an ocular melanoma  which is a cancerous tumor located right behind the eye.This news was a heartbreaking shock to us  but thankfully this specific tumor is treatable via a radiation patch that gets placed behind the eye for a week  then removed  followed by medications to stop the tumor from leaking fluid into the eye. As with any procedure  there are possible side effects such as radiation splash and sight loss  but we are hopeful with this incredible doctors success rate of 99.99%. Which brings me to the reason I am here writting this to all who come across it. This specific doctor does not go through any health insurance for payment  so the whole $25 000+ would have to come out of my parents pocket. They have thankfully been able to gather about half of what is needed  but not without struggle and loss. Now  I know the state of the economy and the want and need to pinch pennies wherever possible  so I am creating this page to ask for anything from a dime you found on the sidewalk to the most gracious of donations to help keep my family whole."

She has a warm and caring spirit  evident in how she has focused her life in serving and caring for others. She served with the U.S. Coast Guard with an honorable discharge  and is now a nurse and massage therapist. Barb is driven to helping people recover and feel well. Barb found a kindred spirit in my brother  Rob  who is also big-hearted and always coming to the aid of others. They met in 2009  fell in love  and married in 2013. They moved to a charming home in the beautiful countryside of Berkeley Springs  West Virginia. They love the outdoors and nurturing living things  so in addition to their day jobs  Barb and Rob put their heart and soul into farming their 4 acres of land  affectionately named Earth Family Farm. They work the soil  grow organic vegetables  and raise chickens  turkeys  and alpacas. Barb has been diagnosed with breast cancer.This diagnosis has changed the course of their lives and now this battle against cancer is part of their story. Barb is determined to keep a positive outlook--a weapon she uses to push back on the incredible stress that cancer brings. They are doing their best to face this challenge with courage and hope. The cancer is relentless though  and her disease has progressed to stage four. It’s taking its toll physically  emotionally  and financially. It is an extremely difficult time for Barb  Rob  and all who love them.  The medical expenses are great and have devasted them financially. As the disease progressed Barb had to stop working full-time and her income is virtually gone. She’s determined to do what she can  though  so she manages to work a few hours each week. They have health insurance  but the medical bills far surpass what insurance will cover. They’ve incurred $15 300 for her recent surgery  and now they need to be prepared for the radiation treatments costing $55 000  and for additional tests and procedures yet to be scheduled and costs unknown. As “givers” they are always rushing to the aid of others  so  it’s difficult for them to ask for help.  But it’s clear that this challenge is too big to for them to tackle on their own. While we can’t battle cancer for Barb  we can help to alleviate some of the financial stress so that they can focus on her recovery. This GoFundMe campaign provides a way for family and friends to rally around them and offer support. Our goal is to raise $70 000 for their medical and living expenses.Rob and Barb desperately need our help. ­Any donation is helpful and deeply appreciated. If you can help in other ways  feel free to reach out to the family. Spread the word to your family and friends  by word-of-mouth  through email  and social media.

What he lacks in arm size  he makes up for with his fun  witty attitude and caring heart. We are asking for your help with his medical bills  living expenses  and whatever needs arise  so he can focus on stomping this cancer back to the Cretaceous period where it belongs.All joking aside  Jeremy Greene was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer on December 10  2018. Unfortunately  this diagnosis comes with a 30% survival rate. Growing up with Cystic Fibrosis  he continuously exceeded all doctors’ expectations and he is determined to do it again by beating this terrible disease.For those of you that don’t know Jeremy personally  he is an extremely positive 39 year old who loves sports  snowmobiling  and filling the room with laughter. He has a 14 year old son that currently lives in Texas with his mother. Sadly  Jeremy’s failing health had him making the tough decision to leave his son in Texas and move back to his home state of Minnesota in order to get access to the healthcare he needs. He currently owns a home with his lifelong friend  now girlfriend  Danielle  her four children that range in age from 6 to 16  and their dog Nala.As you can imagine  the costs for the medical procedures that are needed to save his life are astronomical. The medical bills for the few month it took to get the diagnosis were $297 346.35  of which Jeremy will be responsible for between 5%-10% depending on the procedure. And treatment hasn’t even begun yet. His first chemotherapy appointment is this Friday.Jeremy recently began working at the Minnesota Department of Transportation when he moved back to Minnesota to seek the medical care he needed. Because he has not been employed at his job for the required length of time  he does not qualify for the rights afforded in the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). This means that his employment and his health insurance are in jeopardy because he may not be able to work enough hours to sustain employment during his chemotherapy treatments.So please consider donating to help this incredible man. Even $5 can make a HUGE difference. And if you cannot afford to donate right now  please share this page on social media. His friends and family love and need him more than they can express.To make you smile  here is a clip of Jeremy in his T-rex suit chasing a Jurassic Park Jeep. It gives you an idea of what a fun loving person he is. Anyone who knows him probably has a story about his crazy antics and is honored to call him a friend. Are you asking yourself  Why all the T-rex jokes? Because Jeremy’s had a T-Rex suit since before they were a “thing”. He has many fond memories playing with his son and the T-Rex suit  and he continues to use the suit to make others laugh.This GoFundMe was put together by Jeremy’s coworkers and all of the money generated through this site will go directly to helping Jeremy.Updates on Jeremy can be viewed on his Caring Bridge page at:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jeremygreene88/journal"

Two weeks ago she was diagnosed with pneumonia and also with pleural  effusion which is extra fluid on the lungs.   After a week of antibiotics Lynn still wasn’t feeling well plus her ankles and her legs were starting to swell so she drove herself to the ER the day after Christmas.Much to everyone’s shock and surprise Lynn was diagnosed with a serious heart issue which  is going to require surgery. She has a heart of gold:  full of kindness and compassion for others but it’s not working properly for her.  ***Update!  Effective 1-21 the company rescinded their offer to continue paying her insurance AND terminated Lynn’s employment in an EMAIL!  ***Lynn works for a small company and has health insurance.  It won’t cover 100% of the costs and since being discharged from the hospital after a week her first round of new meds alone  was $325.00.  If she were able to work that wouldn’t be an issue however Lynn has been placed on an unpaid medical leave. That means that her basic bills such as housing and car plus car insurance will need to be paid along with any medical costs not covered by insurance once she goes through the small amount of savings she has.( Not to mention the hospital bills not covered!). She’ll probably be off work anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks with this open heart surgery.  The good news is that the surgery will make a significant difference in her health and she should be able to live an even better life afterwards.   We don’t want her to have to worry about finances on top of everything else. She already takes care of two elderly parents and that’s enough stress for anybody.

A routine chest x-ray was performed that showed a nodule that required further testing. From then  many lab tests  ultrasounds  CT Scans and biopsies have been done all to find out that at the age of 17  Pablo has been diagnosed with Lung Cancer.

At this time his Oncologist is still determining the best course of action. Although Pablo’s family does have health insurance  it unfortunately will not nearly cover all the costs associated with this battle.

She has a heart of gold:  full of kindness and compassion for others but it’s not working properly for her.  ***Update!  Effective 1-21 the company rescinded their offer to continue paying her insurance AND terminated Lynn’s employment in an EMAIL!  ***Lynn works for a small company and has health insurance.  It won’t cover 100% of the costs and since being discharged from the hospital after a week her first round of new meds alone  was $325.00.  If she were able to work that wouldn’t be an issue however Lynn has been placed on an unpaid medical leave. That means that her basic bills such as housing and car plus car insurance will need to be paid along with any medical costs not covered by insurance once she goes through the small amount of savings she has.( Not to mention the hospital bills not covered!). She’ll probably be off work anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks with this open heart surgery.  The good news is that the surgery will make a significant difference in her health and she should be able to live an even better life afterwards.   We don’t want her to have to worry about finances on top of everything else.

Three years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Since then I have struggled with attempting recovery  only to have the illness come back each time. I spent nine months in a specialized treatment facility last year. I had to go back to work and eventually leave the program altogether before I was physically and mentally ready due to financial reasons. I've been told by my treatment team that my current health situation is critical and I am being sent to a residential treatment facility on Thursday  Jan 24th to be medically stabilized. Because of this I am losing my job and my health insurance and will be unable to work for at least six months (if not more). As hard as this decision is  I've been told that if I keep going on like I have been much longer I am going to die. I want to recover. But I need a lot of help to get there.I have been able to cover all the medical expenses on my own up until this point  but I am now completely drained financially and cannot get the care I desperately need without help. My family is assisting as much as they can  but we need help. The money I am asking for will assist me in covering costs for medical care  health insurance  and bills while I am out of work. I do plan on filing for disability  but must be out of work for a minimum of 30 days before applying and the process is not quick or even guaranteed. And due to me being out of work so much last year  any amount I would receive would be minimal. Unfortunately  I am not covered under FMLA due to the size of the company I work for.Anorexia is considered the deadliest mental illness. 1 in 5 sufferers die. Through the years my ongoing battle with anorexia has caused damage to my thyroid  kidneys  liver  and heart. I am fighting through extreme fatigue and insomnia. My hair is falling out. I have lost consciousness on multiple occasions due to a combination of low blood pressure  low heart rate  and low blood sugar. At one point during a biweekly medical check up my heart rate was so low my doctor said she had to call an ambulance to take me to a hospital immediately because I was in danger of going into cardiac arrest. My heart seems to be taking the hardest hit and I have been in the emergency room multiple times due to heart palpitations and chest pain. Currently  walking even short distances doubles my heart rate because the consistent malnourishment has weakened it to a dangerous level. I know this all sounds scary. Because it is.I don't want to die. But I can't fight this battle alone. I'm ready to fight through this illness and get better. I'm ready to be happy again and to have my life back. I want to be able to have the mental ability and energy to do the things I'm passionate about  including MRKH awareness and teaching my church preschoolers about the love of Jesus. My eating disorder has taken so much from me. As hard as it is to share all this  I need help to get there. Thank you for reading. It is a challenge for me to be so vulnerable after keeping this struggle a secret for so long  but I am desperate to get better. I am stepping out in faith and trusting that God will provide during this time. Any support and prayers you can give are much appreciated. Know that I am surrounded in love and encouragement from my loved ones during this time.With love Kristen"

If you have been following Keli's posts and updates recently  you will know that she was in the hospital and had major surgery a couple weeks ago. And while it saved her life  she has a very long recovery and another surgery ahead of her. This summer she'll have another surgery to put her bowels back together and they'll do a hysterectomy at the same time. This all started and got so bad because she had undiagnosed endometriosis. She has been dealing with the symptoms since she was a teen but her doctors never took her pain seriously until it spread throughout her bowels and nearly killed her. She has a very large incision (if you ask  she'll send you a pic) that will take months to heal and a colostomy bag. Both make it very difficult to get around and she won't be able to go back to work for nearly a year. On top of all this she is a type 1 diabetic -- this complicates her recovery and she needs money to pay for her insulin and diabetic supplies. She needs your help covering her bills while she is out of work (e.g. cell phone  car insurance  health insurance  diabetic supplies and dog food). We've done some math and she'll need about $750 a month to cover the basics and she might not be able to get back to work for 8 or 9 months. So she really needs $7 000 just to cover the basics and that doesn't include hospital bills that are yet to come.  Any help you can give is appreciated. We will be updating this page as her needs change and any excess funds will go towards her medical bills."

Living her best life in Charlotte  NC  our beloved Kristin suffered a heart attack on December 9  2017  at the age of 28. Cardiologist worked to control spasms with medication and therapy which seemed to work. What they discovered six months after the attack was something no one expected. We were all devastated when doctors found a malignant mass was rapidly growing near her heart. She was diagnosed with a rare heart cancer called Sarcoma--  The cancer is so rare that symptoms are often mistaken for other illnesses and often diagnosed too late. Kristin’s life was saved by a low-grade fever which lasted for three days. Simple tests and due diligence by her primary care physician led to questions and more complex testing. She was hospitalized for 5 weeks last June in the intensive care cardiac unit where teams of specialists began an aggressive chemo regimen four days a week. They worked to shrink the mass  but not too fast because of the risk of cardiac arrest. At one point  cardiologists had to perform an emergency procedure to place a stent in an artery that was nearly closed. Kristin shared her story with only a few friends and family.  As we all prayed  Kristin began a courageous fight for her life. She has remained brave and strong  enduring the horrific effects of chemo and physical stress of the mass which caused extreme discomfort  shortness of breath  weakness  loss of strength. BUT God--  We serve an AWESOME God and we knew Kristin would fight the beast invading her body with every breath.  Most of last year was spent in and out of the hospital with family traveling back and forth to Charlotte staying months at a time during critical periods of hospitalization.  Because of this medical crisis  Kristin has exhausted her savings and has been forced to stay on medical leave without income for daily living expenses like rent  utility bills  car note  health insurance premiums  and medication.  We are extremely blessed and know that with faith and prayer Kristin will get her life back and is already working with the hospital to help other young people stricken with this type of rare cancer. We are humbly asking family  friends  and supporters to come together to help with financial support during a very difficult time.  We continue in prayer for Kristin’s complete recovery and strength. Despite all her physical and financial challenges  she remains committed to helping other young people fighting cancer. On April 27th  Kristin will participate in the Levine Cancer Institute’s  Sarcoma Stomp! Kristin’s Crusaders will join hundreds of others to fight this insidious rare cancer.Our family would like to sincerely thank you for your love  prayers  friendship  support  and donations  which will greatly help her during this challenging time!Love and Blessings to you all.The Oliver Family(If you have any questions  please email Pam Oliver pam.newslady@gmail.com or Tiffani Marshall Marshall.Tiffani@gmail.com)"

It turned out that the mononucleosis triggered something that completely changed my life. Even though I thought I was better the symptoms then came back again on a monthly basis. This lasted for years  and each time the symptoms came back I lost a little more motion  balance  and coordination of my body. I do know that is a progressive autoimmune/neurological disease that continues to this day. Due to this  I now use a wheelchair.For 17 years  I have gone without a diagnosis  which could potentially lead to treatment. I have seen many doctors  including those at Harvard  New York Presbyterian  Weill Cornell  and The Cleveland Clinic  and I am currently working with a geneticist at Yale New Haven Hospital.

So far  this testing has not yielded anything that could hint at a diagnosis. She wants to conduct mitochondrial DNA testing of my genes  which could provide more answers  and genetic analyses of my parents and brother. Health insurance tends not to cover genetic testing  so I am asking for your generosity to help me pay for these tests in the hopes of getting closer to possible answers.There is a chance that the testing may not provide an answer  but I cannot know this unless it's completed. If it does yield any information  it could lead to a diagnosis and/or treatment which could help me better plan for my future. Plus  I will finally know what I have  which has been a question I have lived with for almost two decades.Every day that passes is another day where my disease is allowed to progress unchecked. I need your help today. Your kind donation will help me keep the fight going to hopefully get the answer I have been seeking."

You can’t prevent it from striking  all you can do is batten down the hatches and hope it doesn’t take everything from you. We have friends who are sitting in a dark  damp cellar right now while the storm rages... and we can help!!As many of you know  James Burdick was diagnosed with testicular cancer about a year ago. He went through surgery and chemotherapy. Looked good! Thought he beat it! But  nope  the lab work and scans shows it has come back. James  his wife  Kristin and their two boys - Tucker and Garret are in a place none of us ever want to see. They’re watching as everything changes daily - the head of their family is in jeopardy. He is now at the start of one of the most difficult chemotherapy treatment regimens we have. He will be so weak and nauseated while going through this for the next few months that he’ll have trouble just making it to the kitchen much less driving himself to his daily chemo treatments.  He has already been told he can no longer drive.We’re really hopeful that it will work and their lives can get back to normal. But right now the entire Burdick family is in the midst of this storm. I know that they have a ton of friends who are willing to help provide a little shelter. They have health insurance but they have to take time off from work and short-term disability doesn’t provide 100% of the paycheck. Savings goes right out the window and then the credit card bills start mounting. They’re way too self-sufficient to ask for help so instead they’ll scrimp on necessities and keep working when they should stay home. Kristin  an amazing nurse who works with cancer patients  should be able to be home taking care of the most important cancer patient in her life. Meals are tasty and convenient  thoughts/prayers are lovely  good wishes are appreciated but let’s send some cash with them. Let’s give them a little breathing room financially so they can just concentrate on weathering this storm and then putting it all back together again. After you donate  please share this story with some friends. Even if they don’t know the Burdicks  you can reassure them that these are truly the type of people that make America great!"

My name is Tammy Millholland.And this is my wonderful brother Bryan Huseby...Bryan is in desperate need of your assistance and prayers. This is him today...But he didn’t always look this way….                                                          BRYAN’S STORYA once vibrant young man….Bryan  44 and the youngest of 4 children  used to be a vibrant young man who enjoyed life to the fullest. Through his life he was an honorable US Marine...and successful up-and-coming amateur kickboxer......who went on to become a well-respected yoga & chi gong (qi gong) instructor and practice the healing arts. He was also a kind soul to every animal and person he came into contact with.Who enjoyed a simple life and gave of himself…Bryan’s way of life has always been a simple one  albeit a unique one. For over 10 years  Bryan lived around the Sedona  AZ region. He loved to help people  was always willing to lend a hand  believed in Karma  and enjoyed nature. And while gainfully employed  Bryan even purposefully took a year and lived in a tent in the forest so that he could be at peace and enjoy the amazing world we live in. In 2016  feeling that he had been away too long  Bryan moved back to his little home town of DuBois  PA because he wanted to be around  and to help  his aging mother in her later years. Who has limited health insurance…When he moved back to his birthplace (pop. 7 454)  Bryan was quick to obtain employment where he could. He leveraged his experience and managed the costs of his simple life with the money he made from teaching yoga  chi gong (qi gong) and helping others through the healing arts. But like many  his health insurance was limited and provided only the most basic coverage. Who has endured an incredible amount of pain for 5 months…In late summer of 2018  Bryan experienced extreme and sudden pain when his appendix burst. However  with his strength of mind and years of staying in shape physically  he ‘gutted’ through the pain and thought that he would get better. However  that was not the case…After going to his local hospital twice  and being sent home twice  Bryan’s pain got so much worse. He became feeble  withered away  and became a skeleton of himself. It was only after 2 months of trying to deal with it on his own  and not asking for help or letting even his family know of his situation  that some of his friends saw how bad he was. To his friends he was literally at death’s door. They immediately paid for a flight and  seeing how bad he was and that he needed expert care  had him flown to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore  MD.A man who should have died…By the time Bryan arrived at Johns Hopkins  the poison from his appendix had already taken a major toll. His blood was septic with 5 different bacteria and he had numerous abdominal abscesses and at least one fistula. This allowed the abdominal abscesses to not only drain into his body cavity  but also allowing the poison into his abdominal organs  taking him closer to death by the minute. In addition the doctors found a small bowel perforation. He had lost more than 50% of his body weight (and he was not overweight to begin with). The doctors at Johns Hopkins  top experts in their field  told him that they were completely shocked and baffled how he was still alive.Johns Hopkins treated him the best they could. He was treated  stabilized  and discharged with multiple active drain tubes and sent back to DuBois on November 10. Too weak to move and in constant pain  his family and friends assisted Bryan the best they could.However  even with home health care assisting  Bryan’s drain tubes became infected themselves and needed to be treated. When he reengaged his local hometown hospital however  they told him that he would need to go back to Johns Hopkins to have the issues with his drain tubes resolved.… And who is fighting for his life this very minute...On Nov 27  2018 with infected drain tubes  and getting weaker instead of better  Bryan left to go back to Johns Hopkins for a follow-up. He was quickly admitted again and  as of this post  is still an inpatient at the hospital. The infection and the drugs required to fight it has taken such a toll on his body that his blood is not producing hemoglobin in large enough amounts. On Dec 11  this resulted in a required blood transfusion. The doctors are still not sure if it will work. And while this hospital picture shows him smiling (back in early Dec 2018)  he was still incredibly weak; and just just before this picture was taken could stand without assistance. He is unable to eat  but through a pic line is being given round-the-clock nutrition  antibiotics and pain medication. He has been told that he will more than likely be unable to eat anything  even semi-solid  for a long time (6mo or longer).UPDATES: 12/24/18 - John Hopkins has released Bryan! What a wonderful Christmas gift. He will be staying with our sister there in DuBois. 3/18/19 - After a short stint over Christmas at home near his family in DuBois  Bryan's condition again became unmanageable. He was transferred to UPMC Hospital in Pittsburgh in January.  After weeks and weeks of additional professional care  Bryan's condition improved enough to allow his surgeons to operate. Today  Bryan underwent over 8 hours of major surgery to try and repair the extensive damage to his abdominal cavity and intestines caused by continued perforation issues and the poison from the abscesses. It is still unknown if he will be returning home to DuBois or if he will need to go into a nursing facility.  ...In the meantime  please send any letters of encouragement or cards to: 1462 Fairfield Dr  Clearwater  FL 33764A man who has lost everything…Since this tragedy  Bryan has been unable to work. This has led to him being multiple months behind on his rent  his utilities  all of his bills. And while family and friends have helped where we can  this illness has ultimately cost him his place to live  and his two cherished pets.  He has essentially become homeless while in the hospital getting care he can’t afford and that his insurance won’t pay for.…Just needs a little help.Bryan  a fighter  a lover of life  a warm friendly smile  and kind soul is fighting for his life. However like most of us  he worries  even in his feeble state. He gets deeply concerned when he thinks about his home being gone  his pets that he loved being gone  and where he will live; how he will pay for all the medical bills  and how will he ever get back on his feet. He knows that the road to recovery will be very long  and he deeply worries about how much of a burden he will be to his family and friends. How can you help?1.      First and foremost  Bryan and his family could use your prayers and emotional support. 2.      Donate to Bryan’s Fund.3.      Share any link that you get on your Facebook  or tweet this link with the hash tag #BryanHusebyFund4.      Not getting better and not being able to take care of himself has crushed Bryan’s spirits. And while donating money here would definitely help Bryan get back on his feet  a card or a word of encouragement would also greatly help him know he is not alone.Where would your money go?All monies raised will go to paying Bryan’s medical bills  providing him with the necessary medical support once he is discharged again  and helping Bryan get back on his feet so that he can continue being a loving son and a wonderful and caring member of society.How much do we need to raise?Frankly speaking... every dollar helps. Thanks to the kind folks at places like John Hopkins and UPMC Pittsburgh  a great portion of his medical bills are being covered. However  at this point  Bryan has been in medical facilities receiving treatment for roughly 8 of the last 9 months. And even with the generosity of the facilities  he will eventually be burdened with those bills.  Not counting the surgery costs  inpatient stay alone runs up to $2500/day.  Even with 90% of the total costs discounted  Bryan is still more-than-likely facing bills easily exceeding $100 000. And that is not even getting him back onto his feet.FAQ: If he is a veteran  why isn’t he getting medical support from the VA?Frankly speaking  since Bryan served and was discharged honorably  he should be entitled to basic VA hospital benefits.  However  like tens of thousands of veterans who served honorably but never had any real health issues  Bryan didn’t’ want to be a burden on the system and hadn’t signed up with the VA. As of this post  we are working with Bryan and the military to get copies of his paperwork and start the VA process. Unfortunately  this will take ‘significant’ time to rectify and he simply cannot go without medical treatment until this is resolved."

Towards the end of the month  the lymph-node in his armpit started to get big and after two weeks of nothing getting better  we went to see the doctor. After many visits  antibiotics  blood work  and miserable nights  Chris landed himself in the ER Christmas night and got admitted to Holmes for 4 days. During that time more tests were done until finally they decided they needed to biopsy the swollen lymph nodes in his neck. After a few days  they called to inform us that Chris has a form T-cell non-Hodkins lymphoma. We still have many questions and things to learn about what is happening and the obstacles that are before us. Some of you know Chris left his Job at UPS over the summer to go back to school. We went from a two income household to a one income household. While we’ve been keeping our heads above water  we have just been skimming by. He lost his health insurance when he left UPS and as a very healthy 25 year old  active male  we both weren’t concerned with finding coverage. Who would have thought  huh (If you don’t have insurance don’t wait like we did and go get it!!)? We were able to get him covered (last minute and at a lot more than we can afford). There are lots of days I’ll be missing from work to go to appointments  watch the kids while he’s going through Chemotherapy  and lots of other added expenses that come with cancer (like our giant hospital bill from our Christmas stay).  I understand lots of people go through tough times  everyone has something going on in their own lives  so I appreciate you taking your time to read about our lives and even considering to help. I’ve always had a hard time reaching out for help. It makes me feel  well  vulnerable and weak. But this isn’t about me it’s about Chris and our family. It’s about me trying to be there for all of them through this tough time and we couldn’t do it without all of our family  friends  and random strangers who support us from the kindness of their hearts.

Both my husband and daughter have entered mental health residential treatment for crisis interventions. We have a high deductible health insurance plan which has a $5400 deductible before it kicks in for coverage. My husband will have a reduced salary while he is in treatment due to his leave of absence at his job. He is the main breadwinner for our family as I have not been able to secure steady work for the past 2 years after my own mental health crisis. We rely on his salary to cover our living expenses  rent  car payment  household bills  medications   Student loans etc.  and my income covers food the best I can. My income is only about $400-$600/ per month and we frequently find ourselves with more month than money. I am currently working as a VIPKID teacher 3 hours a day  an Art model about 2X per month  a gynocological teaching associate once a month and am in training to become a travel agent  which will take time to begin to achieve income. I am also offering cooking lessons  soap making lessons and herbal medicine making lessons but these also are taking time to show income and I do food recalls for food suppliers on an as needed basis. We are already under water with back medical bills due to the previous need for intensive mental health care for the family. This current crisis comes at a time of great financial stress for us. For February we are looking at not having enough income to cover our basic living expenses for rent and household expenses and food before we even begin to pay the deductible of $5400 we have racked up. I can no longer keep our financial situation in order with out some kind of help. I have tried to negotiate with med providers  hospitals  and gotten information assistance from NAMI( National Association for Mental Illness) but the fact of the matter is we will not be able to make rent  bill payments  food needs and pay our deductible come Feb 1 and the assistance we most need is financial. I am asking for any help you can provide to help us get through this crisis.  And please share this campaign if you feel so moved. That can help quite a bit. Thank you very much."

The other driver got angry about the horn blowing & continued to “brake check” Dalton several times in attempts to make Dalton run into the back of him.  Dalton blew his horn a few more times. Dalton backed way off as theyexited the tunnel &  proceeded up the interstate & thought the “altercation” was over. Dalton noticed the other driver slowing down as if he were going to exit the interstate. This is when Dalton looked over to see the driver pointing a gun at him & he started shooting at Dalton through his passenger side window & door. Dalton was struck 5 times out of 7 rounds fired. Dalton was instantly injured critically & was barely able to maintain control & maneuver his vehicle back to the right side of the road. He was able to slow the vehicle just enough before hitting the jersey wall  coming to a stop & then rolled out of his truck onto the ground. He was lying in a growing puddle of blood on the side of the road when helpful people began to stop. Thanks to Jesus Christ  several passing motorist  Sentara Norfolk General rescue teams & the strong heart of a hard working young man...Dalton is still fighting for his life here on this earth. The police explanation is that it was a \"road rage incident\". Dalton is in critical care in Norfolk Sentara hospital. He has suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the chest & abdomin. Dalton is very lucky to even be alive & now faces a long hard struggle to get back to some nomality in his life. He had a fairly good job at Branscom Asphault Co. & had been working up to 60-70 hours a week at times because he had been trying hard to get several bills \"including some previous medical bills\" caught up & paid off. He volunteered  to work any & all possible extra hours & even helped work on peoples cars in his spare time to earn extra money. His plan was to get his medical  Truck & motorcycle bills paid so he may be able to find a house closer to work to rent or buy on his own soon. He has always been a kind  Freindly & helpful in any way kind of young man. Any & all donations will go directly to Dalton to help him during his recovery as to not get any farther behind on bills & any medical or therapy bills that may arise from this incident.  I could go on for a very long time about how wonderful of a young man & friend Dalton is to so many. But anyone who knows him already knows this. I wanted to get this page up for Daltons sake. I know that he has & would never ask for anything from anyone without offering work or assistance in return... But I also know that this may be a very long recovery. Dalton has very limited health insurance so any & all help will be needed  & EXTREMELY appreciated. Within the first few days Dalton has already started recieving bills from anastesia & radiology totaling over $17 000 dollars. Anything that may help him not worry so much during this road to recovery is worth the world to Dalton  his family & friends.  Thank you kindly for your thoughts & prayers during this time.￼￼"

My wife  shown in the photo is Maureen Nimmo. shortly before her massive left-brain hemorrhagic stroke August 31  2015. She spent 26 days  on the brink of death  in Intensive Care at Beth-Israel Deaconess Hospital in Boston  after life-saving emergency neurosurgery in the early hours of September 1  2015. The stroke was so damaging to her right side arm and leg  cognition  speech & respiratory system (to name only a few)  that the Post-Op predictions for her were very bleak indeed with the projections from the surgical team of her  at best  being wheel-chair ridden  breathing through a tracheotomy and eating via gastrointestinal tube for the rest of her life.Since that time  Maureen has stayed in FIVE different Health facilities  each having done much to mitigate particular issues that she has had to deal with  & then transferred to the next  either for the next issue to be handled  or because she has \"plateau-ed  and there is nothing more we can do for her\"  basically code  for Health Insurance Companies to discontinue paying for her care. Yet  at each facility  Maureen HAS made progress  admittedly with a lot of my insistence  and screaming at said Health insurers until I'm blue in the bloody face for them to continue paying for her care  and soliciting the help and support of the medical staff of the respective institutions to aid me in these efforts.The fact is  Maureen has made continuous  unprecedented progress for 3.5  years  and is yet to \"plateau\".  I want to bring her home. She is the sweetest  kindest person I've ever known  and is currently making liars of the insurance companies with regard to said plateau issues. Many  actually  most medical professionals' (i.e.Neurosurgeons  and Doctors in general) and ALL Health Insurer's will tell stroke victim's and their family/friends that the window of opportunity for any sort of neurological progress after a stroke is 6 to 12 months. BUNK! Three and a half years is a little longer than that  isn't it? In fairness I must add that I have been by her side full-time advocating for her  and doing five days per week therapy with her.  Now I feel that she is well enough to come home.Trouble is  we only have a few thousand dollars left to do all of this with i.e. Home renovation  Custodial Care  therapy  prescriptions etc. I am 67 and Maureen is 65. Me  You can throw me out  but not my girl.  She's got too much to prove beyond what she has already done. I  have never asked for a hand out in my life & nor has Maureen  but we don't know what else to do. The Healthcare System (Medicaid  Medicare & Private Health Insurers) would rather spend $thousand per month keeping Maureen institutionalized  in Long Term Care than give me half that much (actually  they will give us ZERO assistance) to bring her home and keep her safe and happy. I will admit  I have NO CLUE  or experience with regard to managing a social media campaign. Perhaps you can help me-I'm all ears. I am sorry for begging  and Maureen  would be too  if she knew I was doing this  but I haven't told her yet  because I don't  want to get her hopes up too much. Thank you so much for whatever you can do  and if that is not monetary  that's o.k.  but please share our story with anyone you can via social media and friend networking in order for this wonderful recovery of Maureen's to continue........God Bless you all"

Specific prayers requested are for his lungs to heal  for his lungs to loosen up  for his oxygen to keep being stable  for his to stabilize on his back this week and for signs that he can eventually be weaned off of the ventilator. We are asking for financial support since Mike probably won't be able to work for months. And even with health insurance  we suspect the cost of all of this will be huge! Anything is greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

All proceeds will go towards medical treatment & to help offset the costs associated during this difficult time!When I look at this picture  I don’t just see a sick Mom  but a strong woman who is fighting to stay alive not only for herself but her children  grandchildren  family & friends that she makes such a big impact on their lives.  Katie is 46 years old  a mother of 4 amazing children:  Deidra-29  Stephanie-24  Cheyanne-22  & Gage-13 yrs old  a 1 yr old grandchild-Lucy  & another on the way in March.  She is also the stepmom of Bryan's children  Meghan-13 & Tyler-12.  A mother’s time is the foundation of a family & Katie is the rock to these children and the ray of light in their lives.  She has raised children that are not hers  taken in so many people that were not blood  and impacted so many lives in ways I cannot even relate to.  She is one of the most kind  selfless  and loving souls I have met and is a stranger to nobody.  Katie would help her worst enemy (if she had any) in a thoughtless second  which is such a rare quality anymore.  She’s given so much support to my family over the past 10 years and enriched my Brother’s life beyond means.  She truly gives the definition of family a new meaning and it’s so refreshing watching the love flow from her to those in her presence.It’s really hard to explain the character of someone you love so much but we’re not here to convince you how amazing and wonderful she is  we’re reaching out in a time of crisis.  She’s picked up so many people and it’s our time to pick up this amazing woman and help save her life!  We are not ready to say Goodbye!Any and all contributions are appreciated and every little bit helps so we genuinely thank you in advance!"

But as you sat down with him  you’d notice that the most striking thing about him wasn’t his physical appearance at all. Instead  it was his playful and charming happy-go-lucky personality; capable of leaving you smiling and feeling special about yourself at the end of the conversation. That was until earlier this year. My name is Sarosh and i’m a final year medical student at Jinnah Sindh Medical University  Karachi. Back in March  my father presented with recurrent episodes of nausea  upper abdominal pain and burning. There was nothing unusual about these symptoms. All of us have experienced them at one point or another especially in the aftermath of a large holiday meal or an untimely midnight snack. Therefore  we felt the rug pulled right from under our feet when my dad was diagnosed with Stage IV Gallbladder Cancer. Gallbladder cancer is a relatively rare and lethal malignancy. According to the Institute of Health and Metrics Evaluation it is  along with biliary tract cancers  the 20th most common cancer with only 169 019 people suffering from the disease globally. What this means is  not only the prognosis for the disease poor but treatment options are also limited due to limited data available from clinical trials. In most circumstances  the only treatment that can be given to patients is palliative chemotherapy. In Baba’s case too  after consultations with doctors from around the world  chemotherapy seemed to be the only way forward. My dad works as Deputy Commissioner in the Federal Board of Revenue— aka the Tax Department. Knowing this  would draw up a certain stereotypical image of a wealthy dishonest bureaucrat in the imagination of many; however  unlike most government officials  my dad has worked with brute honesty on a basic salary his entire life. This is why after thirty years of service  the only property to call his own is a three bedroom apartment in a middle class neighborhood. And this is also why  gathering finances for his treatment  which is unconscionably expensive  has been a challenge from the beginning. Still  using whatever savings we had and help from the family  we decided to start treatment at Agha Khan University Hospital. Naively thinking  praying  this wouldn’t be permanent  somehow with therapy his cancer would downstage and become surgically operable but the money kept pouring out and baba’s health has kept declining. Anyone that knows about Agha Khan  knows about the treatment costs there. Without health insurance and the government criminally slow to reimburse costs  we have had to spend millions of rupees (tens of thousands of dollars) on chemotherapy  procedure costs  lab tests  scans  consultations and in patient treatment by taking out personal loans  exhausting our savings and at times asking family members for help. After 6 cycles of treatment at AKU  we have switched out his treatment to a local more affordable chemotherapy center near our home. During this time  we have also discovered that certain tests can be done to determine whether my dad can be given newly researched targeted therapies. Expensive tests and treatments— done and imported from overseas. But at this point  we have been drained financially to continue getting him the standard treatment he so desperately needs let alone think about new treatment options. Baba’s disease has not only been emotionally devastating but has also crippled our family financially. For someone who started his life without a penny in his pocket to become a gazetted officer  through sheer hard work  it is painfully difficult to ask for help from others just to keep him alive. We humbly request everyone to please contribute whatever you can in the way of Allah to help fund my dad’s fight against this unforgiving disease. May He reward you for showing compassion towards His creation.

She is the loving mother of 4 children and full time care taker to 3 of her 5 grandchildren with her 6th on the way. Mama Ana was diagnosed with gallstones a few months ago but was planning to pass them naturally. On New Year’s Eve  unexpectedly  my father in law found Ana on the floor of the bathroom violently ill and in life-threatening conditions. Coach Bichos mother  Ana Rosa Lorenzo Enciso  was unexpectedly rushed to the Hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting on Sunday. Through out the course of the day  her condition rapidly deteriorated and she fell into cardiac arrest and toxic shock. She has been diagnosed with acute pancreatic necrosis  which now has created an advanced decay of the surrounding organs. She now is being held in the Hospital Versailles in Puerto Vallarta with a specialist in the endocrine field  but she needs to be transported to receive a major open abdominal surgery and needs to be held in the ICU at the CMQ in Puerto Vallarta. This is a time sensitive condition as her pancreas is secreting fluid into her abdomen and lungs making it hard for her to breath  and the hospital will not accept her with out a deposit of $100 000mx pesos. Her hospital bill will be around $60 000mx pesos a day after the operation  not including medicine for recovery.Unfortunately  Bichos parents do not have the means to even begin to cover the hospital bill of where she is being held now  and they are unable to transport her to receive treatment because they don’t have the financial ability to make the deposit. We are calling out to all our friends and family is a desperate cry for help. We understand it is holiday season and many don’t have much to contribute  but any donation will get us closer to making sure this amazing woman and mother to coach bicho survives the new year. Ana Rosa has been our #1 supporter through our career as SUP athletes  housed and fed us when we were living in athletes salaries... she has never missed a JR SUP event or a professional race of ours. She has rescued us from injury and illness  she has provided unconditional love and support for us and the team every step of the way. We now are asking for loving support in return.Our family does not have private health insurance so all of the hospital bills and medicine are full price and we are unable to cover them personally. All the funds acquired in this gofundme will go to covering the down-payment needed to gain her access to the ICU in the CMQ Puerto Vallarta where she will be able to receive the treatment needed to be on the road to recovery. They will also help our family with the 3-4 week long hospital stay the doctors have said we are looking at. After she is released from her hospital stay  she will need monthly abdominal scans for the next year  and months of insulin injections and high powered antibiotics to control the return of the pancreatitis. We thank everyone who has helped to care for Ana  her daily visitors  and all of the kind donors who have pitched in to help my mother-in-law survive this infection."

It was heartbreaking for all of us  but especially scary for Mike as he has battled with addiction for years. Mike desperately wants to get clean and healthy but a major barrier for this is the cost of treatment.Mike is currently in a detox facility but ultimately needs a long term  structured care program with a dual-focus on addiction and grief counseling. While he is fortunate to have health insurance that covers detox treatment  Mike's insurance will be running out soon without coverage for a 60-day program that will provide a stable foundation on which to build his recovery. A sober-living facility with specialization in dual diagnosis and treatment is key to that success  but the cost is over $10 000.Many folks asked me what they can do to support us while we are grieving. My family's most immediate need is to get Mike the care and support he needs.

Our mother  Lori Leif  was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that metastasized to her liver at the age of 55. The diagnosis came after a girls camping trip to Colorado. About a week before the trip mom started having some abdominal pain and wasn’t feeling herself. We talked about cancelling the trip but we had all taken off work to make it work and done a lot of planning so she said she’d be fine and she wanted to tough through it. We made the 8 hour drive to Colorado and she was a trooper the whole time. We slept on the ground  roughed it in the woods  and set up/took down our camp. On the way home she was so miserable we decided it was time to go to the hospital. We thought it was her gallbladder so we brought her to the hospital that we work at and had everyone for her surgery picked out before even walking in the door of the ER. This alone was a big deal for mom. She always says how she wants to keep all her parts  so she was stressed out and scared about having to have surgery. It was also a big deal because mom didn’t have health insurance. We knew it was gonna be pricey but we were all willing to do whatever it took to help her feel better. After getting to the hospital on September 11th and telling the doctors her symptoms  they ordered an ultrasound to check her gallbladder. On the ultra sound they found multiple masses on her liver. They ordered a CT scan to get a better look and discovered an area on her colon that was concerning. It gave a whole new meaning to the song “ Where Were You” by Alan Jackson. Our lives were stopped in that moment. She was our person. Our only parent as we don’t have a good relationship with our dad or his parents and my moms parents are deceased. She’s who we look to in times of turmoil  frustration  sadness  etc. The tests continued and we got the final diagnosis. She was in the hospital for a week before finally being discharged. Now is where our new normal starts. She gets chemo every other week on Fridays  and will continue to do this in 6 month increments until the tumors are gone (the miracle we are praying for)  a new option  or until it quits being effective.  She gets a CT scan after every 4th cycle of chemo to check and see how the tumors are responding to the chemo. On her off weeks she comes in for lab draws to make sure that her blood levels are reacting well with the chemo. On her chemo weekends she stays in Lincoln with Miranda and Brittany. All four of us enjoy spending time together and doting on her while she is with us! On top of the cancer diagnosis  Lori's divorce was also finalized a week after she found out she had cancer. Which this was a good thing but unfortunately she is also responsible for some bad decisions made by her ex and has monetary responsibilities that add to the financial burden. Through this whole ordeal we have worked closely with wonderful advocates at the hospital to help with getting treatments covered and assisting with applying for Medicaid. But unfortunately nothing in life is free and treatments  procedures  labs  doctor visits  and life expenses all add up quickly. As Lori is not able to work at this time she does not have an income and has many outgoing expenses. We have tried to help with as much as possible but there comes a time when you have to set your pride aside and accept help. There have been many people who have reached out wanting to help and right now a monetary donation would be the most helpful for our family. Any donation would be MUCH appreciated and put towards paying medical bills  housing expenses  groceries  etc. I hold HOPE with the future being unknown  because anything is possible! We will surround Lori with love  light and support while she continues to fight back against those nasty cancer cells. Through all this  Lori remains positive and radiates love and support to those around her. She is truly one of the very best humans I know (not just because she is my mother!) and she inspires me to be a better person  grow in my faith  and love everyone around me just as she does. Thank you so much for reading this. Your time  donation and love will truly make a personal difference! We love you Lori. Not a day will EVER go by where we don't fight this cancer with you and help hold you up when you need a crutch!  Good vibes only and prayers to our Warrior Queen!"

Please help ♡Lori moved to Nashville in 2012 for a fresh start after divorce  and was living on her own for the first time in her life. She was thriving in her new hometown soaking up all the live music she could. I mean she really soaked it up. e.g. she went to 46 live music events in her first year in Nashville! In 2013 she purchased her first home by herself and was sure to get one just big enough for herself  a home office  and a guest room. She is passionate about helping others and opened her home to up and coming singers/songwriters/musicians to stay at no charge while they were in town writing and/or recording. She also helped fund many artists’ records anytime she was financially able. In all she unconditionally gave more than $35 000 to support musicians or struggling friends over a 3 year period. In late 2014  Lori became very ill and over the next 8 months or so went through a full range of tests to figure out what was going on. After seeing numerous specialists and enduring hours upon hours of testing she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and is still dealing with the effects of the condition which at times makes her unable to get out of bed. She was still working despite her condition. On the morning of March 11  2016  Lori woke and was unable to walk. She was home alone and had to call 911 for assistance. An MRI showed that Lori had two severely herniated discs in her lumbar spine impinging her spinal cord causing extreme pain. It was determined that the herniations were a result of a bad fall on ice she had several weeks prior. On April 4th she had major back surgery to fix the herniated discs and within hours after surgery she was walking on her own. It was almost miraculous! Several weeks later she was back to walking an average of 7 miles a day with her dog until one day in July she rolled her ankle and fell in the street. The back pain returned and she did everything she could to avoid a 2nd surgery but there was no relief and in November 2016 she underwent major back surgery again  only 7 months after her first one. The surgery provided some relief but not completely. She could handle the discomfort but once again  she fell and the pain became unbearable. She went through months of physical therapy but the pain would not go away. In November 2017  Lori had to have her lumbar spine fused and spent a week in the hospital. It typically takes three months or so for a fusion to heal but Lori’s bone graft was not growing. She had to wear a bone growth stimulator 24/7 for several months but the bone graft still wasn’t taking. A year had passed and in November 2018 her surgeon told her there were two options – wait and see or do a 4th surgery to revise the fusion using a different graft material. At this point  I need to mention that in November 2016 while she was on medical leave for the second back surgery  she lost her job. She continued to pay COBRA cost of health insurance due to her Fibromyalgia  spine issues  oh and the fact that she was told she is high risk for breast cancer after a questionable spot was found on her mammogram. She has had to go every 6 months for diagnostic mammograms  ultrasounds and breast MRIs to monitor the spot. Because of her spinal fusion not healing  her spine surgeon has not released Lori to return to work. Her COBRA insurance ran out in August last year and she went without insurance. Because of this she had to choose the “wait and see” option of her spine issues. Without any income since 2016  she used all savings accounts  her IRA account  her 401k  gifts and/or loans from friends and family to pay her mortgage  car payment  household bills  COBRA insurance and medical bills. She still has not been able to return to work and has reached the end of her funds. She is still in need of the surgery to revise the spinal fusion and is in a catch 22. She can’t work because of her spine and she can’t get spine surgery because she has no income. Lori started the disability application process with the Social Security Administration in 2017 and her case is still in process after multiple denials and finally getting a hearing in front of a disability judge. Lori has always done everything in her power to help others and is too independent and “proud” to ask others for help. Thankfully she did apply for assistance with food and currently receives SNAP benefits each month to buy groceries. However  she does not know how she is going to pay her mortgage or other bills next month  much less the remainder of the year."

This terrible disease has exhausted her savings and led to complications including osteonecrosis  which necessitated the removal of several teeth and part of her jaw bone. While on antibiotics for the osteonecrosis  she was required to suspend chemotherapy for seven months  thus interrupting her progress toward remission. Now back in treatment  Sandra is facing a mountain of medical bills  only a small portion of which are being covered by health insurance. She is seeking donations for her bills  as well as money for chemotherapy and urgent dental surgery. Sandra’s been given an improved prognosis for achieving remission thanks to an aggressive treatment that combines two chemotherapy drugs. If successful  this approach could help many others affected by bone-marrow cancer. Her goal is to “feel better”—but she wants those suffering from this disease to do so  as well. Sandra is a fighter  having successfully won a battle with breast cancer a decade ago. Since then  she’s used her time to “pay it forward” by supporting her church  friends in ill health  and others in need. She also spent many years caring selflessly for an elderly couple who suffered from dementia. Sandra has never hesitated to give of herself for the benefit of others. NOW  SHE’S THE ONE WHO NEEDS YOUR HELP. Sandra hopes  more than anything  to get well enough to spend her remaining time living at home with her beloved service dog Beckham.

Eric and my Mom have been married for 21 years and I am proud to call him my Dad.  He is a faithful Christian and the sweetest  honest  most caring and good hearted man I have ever known and I’m so happy that my Mom found him.  Mom is retired and gets a skimpy SS check every month.  Anyone that knows Eric  knows that he would do anything for you  including giving you the shirt off of his back. He is one of those guys that will drop whatever he is doing to come and help you out.  He is definitely a rare breed.  I’m sure there is a fine line of decision when you are diagnosed with Cancer…..do I let Cancer beat me or do I try to beat Cancer and strap my family with a financial burden for the rest of their lives?? Here is the story of what some people might go through to try to beat it.In the Spring of 2018 at the age of 53  Eric was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer. This came as quite a shock since he had no symptoms of the disease. He has always been healthy  doesn’t drink or smoke.  His blood work came back with high PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) counts.  They took 12 cultures of his prostate and discovered all 12 cultures had cancer present and the cancer was at a #7 and very aggressive and had to be removed as soon as possible. Then they performed a CT scan.While waiting on his scheduled surgery  he got the bill from the CT scan and his insurance had paid ZERO $$$.  When he called to find out why  he was told that his insurance DID NOT cover CT scans.  Ok  didn’t know that but it was too late to do anything about it.  In April he had his prostate removed.  The surgery went well but the Doctor’s told him that his prostate was enlarged and perforated. Therefore  the cancer got out before Dad got into surgery.  Blood tests to follow to see what his PSA is.  Blood work results are back and Cancer is still present. The only good news is that the Cancer has not spread into any of his organs.  It is still based around the prostate and that he would now have to do 33 rounds of radiation. For those of you who do not know  radiation is 5 days a week until you hit the desired number of rounds specified by your Dr.Now Eric gets the bill from his Prostate surgery.  Again  the insurance company had paid ZERO $$$.  Eric calls to find out what is going on only to be told  “We don’t cover cancer”!!  Panic sets in!  Eric is now calling other insurance companies before he has his radiation.  He is either told “we don’t cover Cancer” or “we don’t cover pre-existing”.  He has absolutely no luck in finding another insurance company to carry him.  So he has his 33 rounds of radiation which just finished in Oct.  So far the bills are around $80 000 OUT OF POCKET because his insurance did not cover ANY of it!!  And  we won’t know if all the Cancer is gone until January 2019 when his blood work is due again to see what his PSA counts are.  Even if you can’t donate  please share this so others that carry their own health insurance can be aware.  Read the FINE PRINT of your policy to make sure you are covered for Cancer before tragedy strikes you.  And if you don't see what you are looking for  call them and ask them point blank!! If you are a man of 50 years of age  get your prostate checked!!!  Doctors have stated that 33% of the male population will get prostate cancer. So please don't procrastinate!! Thank you for taking the time to read this story  for donating  and for sharing.  Veronica"

As a single mother at 32 years old with 2 beautiful children  the word “cancer” broke me. The end of the summer consisted of me visiting my doctors numerous times to determine what would be the best plan for me. Due to my tumor size  the best choice for me is a mastectomy. This option would allow the surgeons to remove the tumor completely from my left breast along with the surrounding cells and lymph nodes. This surgery is the beginning to 3 other surgeries that will follow to complete the reconstruction of my breasts.Cancer is a journey that takes time  patience and strength. Throughout this long journey I have given up my job in order to fight this battle. I am now reaching out to those who have supported me mentally through this challenge and hoping that I can still beat cancer. This Go Fund Me page is to raise money for medical expenses that unfortunately my health insurance cannot cover.Beating cancer is much more difficult when your finances aren’t able to reach the strength that you need.

"Medical","February 22, 2019","Helping Heather","$5,905","$15,000","58","1","68","478","ARLINGTON","TX","As many of you already know  our beloved Heather was recently diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. It came as a huge shock given her age and that she has always been in good health. Her husband Rob and children  Taylor (18) and Brady (8)  have been devastated  and of course baby Wyatt (1) is way too young to understand what is going on.The fight began on Aug 15  2018  with back pain. At first  she believed she may have slept wrong and strained something  but then when it didn’t subside she thought it may be kidney stones.  After weeks of severe pain  she went in to the doctor and was referred to do x-rays on October 2  2018. By chance  it would later turn out  the scan caught stones in her left kidney. They were not looking for kidney stones  their thinking was that the pain was being caused by something related to her bones.So  Heather went home  and after a week of heavy water intake and such  she had zero pain on the right side  it only remained on the left. That prompted a referral to a urologist  which led to the first surgery to remove the kidney stones (at that point she had two stones  large in size and no way to pass them on her own). However even the urologists she saw all stated there shouldn’t be pain associated to them since they weren’t trying to be passed  they were only sitting. This should have been a big red flag  in retrospect.  Her first surgery was on November 6  2018  to blast the stones  but they were only able to get one of them. The other required a different type of surgery and a new urologist. An appointment for that was set for Dec 5  2018. In the meantime  she was in and out of the emergency room for pain management about every three to four days (with a huge deductible  I may add). The Sunday following Thanksgiving  frustrated beyond belief with the whole ordeal  she decided to go to a new emergency room that wasn’t associated with her urologists (where she had been going at their direction so that they had access to her records). In the new emergency room  after blood was drawn  a urine sample was taken  and a CT scan was done  she was told that she had pancreatic cancer. It was a complete shock  to say the least. When the doctor walked in the room she thought he was going to tell her she had more stones. And it happened within an hour of her arrival  after so many months of not knowing the real reason for the pain  which turned out to be that the size of the cancer had grown so large it was now pressing on things around it. Within hours of her diagnosis she admitted to oncology. It was determined through biopsy that she was stage four and that it had already spread to her liver  and possibly to her lungs as well. She was told she was terminal and could not be cured. Since then  she has been in and out of the hospital for various reasons related to the cancer. It’s a brutal  painful  debilitating disease. The pain as of February has already become so bad that she can’t walk and is bed bound 24/7 when she is lucky enough to be home. Recently she was told  after putting herself through the physical trauma of chemotherapy since December  the tumor markers in her blood were spiking at last check; indicating her tumors are not shrinking. She was originally told that she would have approximately nine to fourteen months left if treatment didn’t help. She is now exploring alternative treatments in hopes it will slow the cancer. While there is no cure  she is fighting very hard for enough time to see her children grow up a little longer.I am writing this as a close friend of the family  but the fund is being set up to go directly to Heather’s amazing husband  Rob  as well as her amazing ex-husband  Steve. You see  in one of the most awe-inspiring things I’ve heard in a long time  Steve has recently moved in with Rob and Heather. Their maturity and dedication to what is best for their children is simply incredible. It’s been a huge help to Rob while he tries to work  take care of Heather  and be a dad to his stepchildren and baby son. And it’s been great for the kids  who need all the support they can get right now.Heather has been denied by insurance for a motorized scooter even though she can’t walk and is bed bound. Her hair is falling out  but she is reluctant to buy herself a wig because she feels too guilty about the medical bills that won’t stop compounding. She is still trying to work through this all  fortunately her company has been bending over backwards to try and help make it easier for her to do so; her coworkers even came together to donate their own hard-earned paid time off to her. It’s still not easy  but she needs her health insurance. She fears her company won’t be able to help her keep her job much longer  though  once the donated hours end and the work she can do from home dries up. This is particularly scary considering that the medical bills are no joke  and they just keep coming and coming. This family is already going through so much and trying so hard to keep it together  the last thing they need is to end up buried in medical bills once she is gone.If you know Heather  you know how strong she is. You know she never asks anyone for anything  she is too stubborn. And you also know that even so  she will still help you if you ever need it  with no hesitation. She needs this  she needs our help now. She deserves to be able to live out the rest of her life more comfortably. She deserves to get to be a little more mobile  so she can be around the kids more  and to let her guilt over the medical bills go  because that’s the last thing she should have to be worrying about.So please anything that you can give to help out this amazing blended family will be greatly appreciated. Of course  not all can give  so if you can’t please know that Heather also very much values all of the thoughts  prayers  good vibes and love sent her way. Thank you.-Casey"

But as you sat down with him  you’d notice that the most striking thing about him wasn’t his physical appearance at all. Instead  it was his playful and charming happy-go-lucky personality; capable of leaving you smiling and feeling special about yourself at the end of the conversation. That was until earlier this year. My name is Sarosh and i’m a final year medical student at Jinnah Sindh Medical University  Karachi. Back in March  my father presented with recurrent episodes of nausea  upper abdominal pain and burning. There was nothing unusual about these symptoms. All of us have experienced them at one point or another especially in the aftermath of a large holiday meal or an untimely midnight snack. Therefore  we felt the rug pulled right from under our feet when my dad was diagnosed with Stage IV Gallbladder Cancer. Gallbladder cancer is a relatively rare and lethal malignancy. According to the Institute of Health and Metrics Evaluation it is  along with biliary tract cancers  the 20th most common cancer with only 169 019 people suffering from the disease globally. What this means is  not only the prognosis for the disease poor but treatment options are also limited due to limited data available from clinical trials. In most circumstances  the only treatment that can be given to patients is palliative chemotherapy. In Baba’s case too  after consultations with doctors from around the world  chemotherapy seemed to be the only way forward. My dad works as Deputy Commissioner in the Federal Board of Revenue— aka the Tax Department. Knowing this  would draw up a certain stereotypical image of a wealthy dishonest bureaucrat in the imagination of many; however  unlike most government officials  my dad has worked with brute honesty on a basic salary his entire life. This is why after thirty years of service  the only property to call his own is a three bedroom apartment in a middle class neighborhood. And this is also why  gathering finances for his treatment  which is unconscionably expensive  has been a challenge from the beginning. Still  using whatever savings we had and help from the family  we decided to start treatment at Agha Khan University Hospital. Naively thinking  praying  this wouldn’t be permanent  somehow with therapy his cancer would downstage and become surgically operable but the money kept pouring out and baba’s health has kept declining. Anyone that knows about Agha Khan  knows about the treatment costs there. Without health insurance and the government criminally slow to reimburse costs  we have had to spend millions of rupees (tens of thousands of dollars) on chemotherapy  procedure costs  lab tests  scans  consultations and in patient treatment by taking out personal loans  exhausting our savings and at times asking family members for help. After 6 cycles of treatment at AKU  we have switched out his treatment to a local more affordable chemotherapy center near our home. During this time  we have also discovered that certain tests can be done to determine whether my dad can be given newly researched targeted therapies. Expensive tests and treatments— done and imported from overseas. But at this point  we have been drained financially to continue getting him the standard treatment he so desperately needs let alone think about new treatment options. Baba’s disease has not only been emotionally devastating but has also crippled our family financially. For someone who started his life without a penny in his pocket to become a gazetted officer  through sheer hard work  it is painfully difficult to ask for help from others just to keep him alive. We humbly request everyone to please contribute whatever you can in the way of Allah to help fund my dad’s fight against this unforgiving disease. May He reward you for showing compassion towards His creation.

The lump and lymph nodes have been removed  but now you are facing 4 months of chemotherapy followed by radiation treatments. There's a catch...if you don't harvest your eggs now  you will lose the possibility of having your own children. Even with insurance  fertility treatment is not covered  not even for cancer patients. There is no time to research and travel the globe to find a cheaper alternative because chemo will be starting this month.This is the true story of my dearest friend. She is not wanting her face or name shared on social media  as she is still trying to wrap her own head around the news. If you can find it in your hearts to donate for this young family so they can climb out of the mountain of medical bills ( thousands of dollars)  and get the eggs harvested and stored until she is recovered (this will cost them thousands of dollars)  I know they would greatly appreciate the help. Feel free to contact me privately if you wish to know more about this person  but for now  all I ask for is your help.

"Medical","March 26, 2019","Phil Makay&apos;s Fight Against Cancer","$6,010","$15,000","51","22","47","","CASSOPOLIS","MI","Firstly  for those of you who do not know  I am adopted. I was adopted when I was five years old  along with Jeanne  Joanne  Don  and Jon – triplets and twins only 14 months apart. Our biological father took another path in life – leaving us behind  and Phil Makay stepped in and gave us his name when he adopted us in 1980. He also filled a role for David and Elaine  my older brother and sister. Dad married my mom in 1979  a single woman with seven kids  and they added another to the mix  Marye. To me  he is not Phil; he is just “dad”. My folks taught me how to work. You work a job  you earn a living  you make your contribution to society  you pay your dues  and when things go wrong  you find a solution to keep things going. My dad and mom both have always worked; it’s just what you’re supposed to do. Dad vowed to serve and protect and wore the uniform for many years in our hometown of Cassopolis  Michigan. He was tough  and maybe not liked by some  but he was a damn good cop!  My dad is also a retired serviceman and served in the National Guard for over 20 years. When my dad had the opportunity to deploy overseas as a civilian contractor in 2010  he jumped at the opportunity; he loved working around the military  and he thrived in the environment. That was brought abruptly to an end by an almost 100% blockage and consequent double-bypass surgery; he never returned to contractor work again. Since then he has worked in the family business and up to recently in a local hometown factory on second shift. He even spent a number of years working to support the family business  an endeavor rooted from my mother’s vision and hard work and with the support of her family at varied times throughout its history.  My mom is a powerhouse  and she’s one woman who could probably do it all on her own. However  dad helped mom out as much as he could over the years. But now  my dad is no longer working - due to his failing health and increased exhaustion  and at the recommendation of his doctor  and this is why……you see  my dad has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer. Although we only found out in September 2018  the doctor believes it has been in his body for at least two years. He is fighting esophageal cancer  and it has spread to his lymph nodes  some of his organs  and to his spine  which has caused a painful hairline fracture in his spine. He has been undergoing chemotherapy for several months now  and although it helped to shrink the mass on his esophagus  either there was no impact to the cancer in other areas of his body  or they actually increased in size. Since then  he’s undergone more chemo and now radiation treatments. Recently  he had to acquire a blood transfusion of two pints due to other complications from the cancer. The Cancer has taken over his body.  While he continues to fight  his body has weakened while he goes through treatment.  It has weakened to the point that he is now unable to work  which was his primary source of health insurance.  When he turns 65  I believe he will qualify for Medicare. Until then  he has no health insurance  and as a result  this has impacted the capability to proceed fully with treatments and PET scans. I am told that a PET scan  without insurance  is quoted at around $22 000 alone. Without health insurance  a dual income  and the energy to go to work  the situation has grown dire – physically  emotionally and financially – for both dad and for mom. At this time  my mom is doing all she can financially  but there is just so much a 76-year old driven  small-business owner and wife can to help with the financial burden. There’s just so much our family as a whole can do to help  but…we want and need to help. My dad is a quiet man  a private man  and he keeps to himself. He doesn’t like a lot of attention. He doesn’t like to ask for help. Neither of my folks do. The stress of the health bills and need for treatment will most likely detract from his ability to recover as fast as he could.  Although my dad and I were not close through many years of my life  we have worked to develop a closer bond as best we can – to overcome time lost. I want to have A LOT more time to make up for time lost…To my dad I want to say thank you.  Thank you for taking a risk  a huge leap  and for choosing to be OUR dad. I hope that I can acquire the help of friends  family  and strangers to give back to you and to mom. I hope we can help  at the least  cover the amount of a PET scan  some treatments  or even help with the financial burdens that have come with this struggle to reduce some of the stress that you and mom are handling each day through this fight. I wish I could make this all better. This is something I hope that I can do to help you both.To my friends  family  and to all of the kind strangers out there Any help – large or small - for Phil--a father  husband  police officer  and military veteran – would be so very much appreciated. Thank you.Jacque Makay"

She is the loving mother of 4 children and full time care taker to 3 of her 5 grandchildren with her 6th on the way. Mama Ana was diagnosed with gallstones a few months ago but was planning to pass them naturally. On New Year’s Eve  unexpectedly  my father in law found Ana on the floor of the bathroom violently ill and in life-threatening conditions. Coach Bichos mother  Ana Rosa Lorenzo Enciso  was unexpectedly rushed to the Hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting on Sunday. Through out the course of the day  her condition rapidly deteriorated and she fell into cardiac arrest and toxic shock. She has been diagnosed with acute pancreatic necrosis  which now has created an advanced decay of the surrounding organs. She now is being held in the Hospital Versailles in Puerto Vallarta with a specialist in the endocrine field  but she needs to be transported to receive a major open abdominal surgery and needs to be held in the ICU at the CMQ in Puerto Vallarta. This is a time sensitive condition as her pancreas is secreting fluid into her abdomen and lungs making it hard for her to breath  and the hospital will not accept her with out a deposit of $100 000mx pesos. Her hospital bill will be around $60 000mx pesos a day after the operation  not including medicine for recovery.Unfortunately  Bichos parents do not have the means to even begin to cover the hospital bill of where she is being held now  and they are unable to transport her to receive treatment because they don’t have the financial ability to make the deposit. We are calling out to all our friends and family is a desperate cry for help. We understand it is holiday season and many don’t have much to contribute  but any donation will get us closer to making sure this amazing woman and mother to coach bicho survives the new year. Ana Rosa has been our #1 supporter through our career as SUP athletes  housed and fed us when we were living in athletes salaries... she has never missed a JR SUP event or a professional race of ours. She has rescued us from injury and illness  she has provided unconditional love and support for us and the team every step of the way. We now are asking for loving support in return.Our family does not have private health insurance so all of the hospital bills and medicine are full price and we are unable to cover them personally. All the funds acquired in this gofundme will go to covering the down-payment needed to gain her access to the ICU in the CMQ Puerto Vallarta where she will be able to receive the treatment needed to be on the road to recovery. They will also help our family with the 3-4 week long hospital stay the doctors have said we are looking at. After she is released from her hospital stay  she will need monthly abdominal scans for the next year  and months of insulin injections and high powered antibiotics to control the return of the pancreatitis. We thank everyone who has helped to care for Ana  her daily visitors  and all of the kind donors who have pitched in to help my mother-in-law survive this infection."

Mike desperately wants to get clean and healthy but a major barrier for this is the cost of treatment.Mike is currently in a detox facility but ultimately needs a long term  structured care program with a dual-focus on addiction and grief counseling. While he is fortunate to have health insurance that covers detox treatment  Mike's insurance will be running out soon without coverage for a 60-day program that will provide a stable foundation on which to build his recovery.

Our mother  Lori Leif  was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that metastasized to her liver at the age of 55. The diagnosis came after a girls camping trip to Colorado. About a week before the trip mom started having some abdominal pain and wasn’t feeling herself. We talked about cancelling the trip but we had all taken off work to make it work and done a lot of planning so she said she’d be fine and she wanted to tough through it. We made the 8 hour drive to Colorado and she was a trooper the whole time. We slept on the ground  roughed it in the woods  and set up/took down our camp. On the way home she was so miserable we decided it was time to go to the hospital. We thought it was her gallbladder so we brought her to the hospital that we work at and had everyone for her surgery picked out before even walking in the door of the ER. This alone was a big deal for mom. She always says how she wants to keep all her parts  so she was stressed out and scared about having to have surgery. It was also a big deal because mom didn’t have health insurance. We knew it was gonna be pricey but we were all willing to do whatever it took to help her feel better. After getting to the hospital on September 11th and telling the doctors her symptoms  they ordered an ultrasound to check her gallbladder. On the ultra sound they found multiple masses on her liver. They ordered a CT scan to get a better look and discovered an area on her colon that was concerning. It gave a whole new meaning to the song “ Where Were You” by Alan Jackson. Our lives were stopped in that moment. She was our person. Our only parent as we don’t have a good relationship with our dad or his parents and my moms parents are deceased. She’s who we look to in times of turmoil  frustration  sadness  etc. The tests continued and we got the final diagnosis. She was in the hospital for a week before finally being discharged. Now is where our new normal starts. She gets chemo every other week on Fridays  and will continue to do this in 6 month increments until the tumors are gone (the miracle we are praying for)  a new option  or until it quits being effective.  She gets a CT scan after every 4th cycle of chemo to check and see how the tumors are responding to the chemo. On her off weeks she comes in for lab draws to make sure that her blood levels are reacting well with the chemo. On her chemo weekends she stays in Lincoln with Miranda and Brittany. All four of us enjoy spending time together and doting on her while she is with us! On top of the cancer diagnosis  Lori's divorce was also finalized a week after she found out she had cancer. Which this was a good thing but unfortunately she is also responsible for some bad decisions made by her ex and has monetary responsibilities that add to the financial burden. Through this whole ordeal we have worked closely with wonderful advocates at the hospital to help with getting treatments covered and assisting with applying for Medicaid. But unfortunately nothing in life is free and treatments  procedures  labs  doctor visits  and life expenses all add up quickly. As Lori is not able to work at this time she does not have an income and has many outgoing expenses. We have tried to help with as much as possible but there comes a time when you have to set your pride aside and accept help. There have been many people who have reached out wanting to help and right now a monetary donation would be the most helpful for our family. Any donation would be MUCH appreciated and put towards paying medical bills  housing expenses  groceries  etc. I hold HOPE with the future being unknown  because anything is possible! We will surround Lori with love  light and support while she continues to fight back against those nasty cancer cells. Through all this  Lori remains positive and radiates love and support to those around her. She is truly one of the very best humans I know (not just because she is my mother!) and she inspires me to be a better person  grow in my faith  and love everyone around me just as she does. Thank you so much for reading this. Your time  donation and love will truly make a personal difference! We love you Lori. Not a day will EVER go by where we don't fight this cancer with you and help hold you up when you need a crutch!  Good vibes only and prayers to our Warrior Queen!"

Eric and my Mom have been married for 21 years and I am proud to call him my Dad.  He is a faithful Christian and the sweetest  honest  most caring and good hearted man I have ever known and I’m so happy that my Mom found him.  Mom is retired and gets a skimpy SS check every month.  Anyone that knows Eric  knows that he would do anything for you  including giving you the shirt off of his back. He is one of those guys that will drop whatever he is doing to come and help you out.  He is definitely a rare breed.  I’m sure there is a fine line of decision when you are diagnosed with Cancer…..do I let Cancer beat me or do I try to beat Cancer and strap my family with a financial burden for the rest of their lives?? Here is the story of what some people might go through to try to beat it.In the Spring of 2018 at the age of 53  Eric was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer. This came as quite a shock since he had no symptoms of the disease. He has always been healthy  doesn’t drink or smoke.  His blood work came back with high PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) counts.  They took 12 cultures of his prostate and discovered all 12 cultures had cancer present and the cancer was at a #7 and very aggressive and had to be removed as soon as possible. Then they performed a CT scan.While waiting on his scheduled surgery  he got the bill from the CT scan and his insurance had paid ZERO $$$.  When he called to find out why  he was told that his insurance DID NOT cover CT scans.  Ok  didn’t know that but it was too late to do anything about it.  In April he had his prostate removed.  The surgery went well but the Doctor’s told him that his prostate was enlarged and perforated. Therefore  the cancer got out before Dad got into surgery.  Blood tests to follow to see what his PSA is.  Blood work results are back and Cancer is still present. The only good news is that the Cancer has not spread into any of his organs.  It is still based around the prostate and that he would now have to do 33 rounds of radiation. For those of you who do not know  radiation is 5 days a week until you hit the desired number of rounds specified by your Dr.Now Eric gets the bill from his Prostate surgery.  Again  the insurance company had paid ZERO $$$.  Eric calls to find out what is going on only to be told  “We don’t cover cancer”!!  Panic sets in!  Eric is now calling other insurance companies before he has his radiation.  He is either told “we don’t cover Cancer” or “we don’t cover pre-existing”.  He has absolutely no luck in finding another insurance company to carry him.  So he has his 33 rounds of radiation which just finished in Oct.  So far the bills are around $80 000 OUT OF POCKET because his insurance did not cover ANY of it!!  And  we won’t know if all the Cancer is gone until January 2019 when his blood work is due again to see what his PSA counts are.  Even if you can’t donate  please share this so others that carry their own health insurance can be aware.  Read the FINE PRINT of your policy to make sure you are covered for Cancer before tragedy strikes you.  And if you don't see what you are looking for  call them and ask them point blank!! If you are a man of 50 years of age  get your prostate checked!!!  Doctors have stated that 33% of the male population will get prostate cancer. So please don't procrastinate!! Thank you for taking the time to read this story  for donating  and for sharing.  Veronica"

As a single mother at 32 years old with 2 beautiful children  the word “cancer” broke me. The end of the summer consisted of me visiting my doctors numerous times to determine what would be the best plan for me. Due to my tumor size  the best choice for me is a mastectomy. This option would allow the surgeons to remove the tumor completely from my left breast along with the surrounding cells and lymph nodes. This surgery is the beginning to 3 other surgeries that will follow to complete the reconstruction of my breasts.Cancer is a journey that takes time  patience and strength. Throughout this long journey I have given up my job in order to fight this battle. I am now reaching out to those who have supported me mentally through this challenge and hoping that I can still beat cancer. This Go Fund Me page is to raise money for medical expenses that unfortunately my health insurance cannot cover.Beating cancer is much more difficult when your finances aren’t able to reach the strength that you need.

"Medical","February 22, 2019","Helping Heather","$5,905","$15,000","58","1","68","478","ARLINGTON","TX","As many of you already know  our beloved Heather was recently diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. It came as a huge shock given her age and that she has always been in good health. Her husband Rob and children  Taylor (18) and Brady (8)  have been devastated  and of course baby Wyatt (1) is way too young to understand what is going on.The fight began on Aug 15  2018  with back pain. At first  she believed she may have slept wrong and strained something  but then when it didn’t subside she thought it may be kidney stones.  After weeks of severe pain  she went in to the doctor and was referred to do x-rays on October 2  2018. By chance  it would later turn out  the scan caught stones in her left kidney. They were not looking for kidney stones  their thinking was that the pain was being caused by something related to her bones.So  Heather went home  and after a week of heavy water intake and such  she had zero pain on the right side  it only remained on the left. That prompted a referral to a urologist  which led to the first surgery to remove the kidney stones (at that point she had two stones  large in size and no way to pass them on her own). However even the urologists she saw all stated there shouldn’t be pain associated to them since they weren’t trying to be passed  they were only sitting. This should have been a big red flag  in retrospect.  Her first surgery was on November 6  2018  to blast the stones  but they were only able to get one of them. The other required a different type of surgery and a new urologist. An appointment for that was set for Dec 5  2018. In the meantime  she was in and out of the emergency room for pain management about every three to four days (with a huge deductible  I may add). The Sunday following Thanksgiving  frustrated beyond belief with the whole ordeal  she decided to go to a new emergency room that wasn’t associated with her urologists (where she had been going at their direction so that they had access to her records). In the new emergency room  after blood was drawn  a urine sample was taken  and a CT scan was done  she was told that she had pancreatic cancer. It was a complete shock  to say the least. When the doctor walked in the room she thought he was going to tell her she had more stones. And it happened within an hour of her arrival  after so many months of not knowing the real reason for the pain  which turned out to be that the size of the cancer had grown so large it was now pressing on things around it. Within hours of her diagnosis she admitted to oncology. It was determined through biopsy that she was stage four and that it had already spread to her liver  and possibly to her lungs as well. She was told she was terminal and could not be cured. Since then  she has been in and out of the hospital for various reasons related to the cancer. It’s a brutal  painful  debilitating disease. The pain as of February has already become so bad that she can’t walk and is bed bound 24/7 when she is lucky enough to be home. Recently she was told  after putting herself through the physical trauma of chemotherapy since December  the tumor markers in her blood were spiking at last check; indicating her tumors are not shrinking. She was originally told that she would have approximately nine to fourteen months left if treatment didn’t help. She is now exploring alternative treatments in hopes it will slow the cancer. While there is no cure  she is fighting very hard for enough time to see her children grow up a little longer.I am writing this as a close friend of the family  but the fund is being set up to go directly to Heather’s amazing husband  Rob  as well as her amazing ex-husband  Steve. You see  in one of the most awe-inspiring things I’ve heard in a long time  Steve has recently moved in with Rob and Heather. Their maturity and dedication to what is best for their children is simply incredible. It’s been a huge help to Rob while he tries to work  take care of Heather  and be a dad to his stepchildren and baby son. And it’s been great for the kids  who need all the support they can get right now.Heather has been denied by insurance for a motorized scooter even though she can’t walk and is bed bound. Her hair is falling out  but she is reluctant to buy herself a wig because she feels too guilty about the medical bills that won’t stop compounding. She is still trying to work through this all  fortunately her company has been bending over backwards to try and help make it easier for her to do so; her coworkers even came together to donate their own hard-earned paid time off to her. It’s still not easy  but she needs her health insurance. She fears her company won’t be able to help her keep her job much longer  though  once the donated hours end and the work she can do from home dries up. This is particularly scary considering that the medical bills are no joke  and they just keep coming and coming. This family is already going through so much and trying so hard to keep it together  the last thing they need is to end up buried in medical bills once she is gone.If you know Heather  you know how strong she is. You know she never asks anyone for anything  she is too stubborn. And you also know that even so  she will still help you if you ever need it  with no hesitation. She needs this  she needs our help now. She deserves to be able to live out the rest of her life more comfortably. She deserves to get to be a little more mobile  so she can be around the kids more  and to let her guilt over the medical bills go  because that’s the last thing she should have to be worrying about.So please anything that you can give to help out this amazing blended family will be greatly appreciated. Of course  not all can give  so if you can’t please know that Heather also very much values all of the thoughts  prayers  good vibes and love sent her way. Thank you.-Casey"

Two years ago Makenna received two life changing pieces of news. The first being she was expecting her second child  and the same week they found she has Thyroid Cancer. Makenna underwent surgery at 14 weeks pregnant to remove her cancerous thyroid gland  and was put on Thyroid Replacement therapy  which she will be on for the rest of her life. Traditionally  the next step would have been Radioactive Iodine  to kill any remaining thyroid tumor cells in her body  but she had to postpone till after my grandson’s birth and her provider supported Makenna in nursing for a short time. Treatment would have to wait until he was weaned. Makenna then took total control of her health. She began researching what would be most beneficial for her health  searching for which ways of eating  and food groups  were most successful in battling cancer. She lost weight  gained strength  both mentally and physically  and felt rejuvenated by the process. Despite these gains  her thyroid Cancer spread into her lymph nodes in her neck surrounding where her thyroid once was. On April 2nd she will undergo her second surgery  a more invasive and involved Neck Dissection where the surgeons will remove as many lymph nodes as possible in her neck. The surgery isn’t without significant risks  but is a necessity for her treatment plan. The current plan is 6 weeks following surgery  she will undergo radio active iodine to destroy any remaining thyroid cells in her body. When she undergoes the radioactive iodine it will require isolation from her family as it is very toxic and could harm those she comes in contact with during her isolation period.Although Makenna has health insurance through her husband Rob  there are many associated costs that are not covered. Rob will also have to miss possibly weeks of work to help provide support and care to her and the children during this process. She will need help for a while to recover  get strong  and continue on her health journey. I know how much you love Makenna and you want to help. I want to make this process as smooth and stress free as possible for her  Rob  Simone  and RJ. Your loving support will help them tremendously with medical costs  support costs  travel  missed work and more thank you again for your time and concern."

As her family began to pick up the pieces and start to process this travesty  Jill underwent a radical hysterectomy and hoped for the best possible outcome. After hearing the results from her lab tests done post-op  that wasn't the case. The tests indicated that are now cancerous cells outside of the uterus   resulting in Stage 3 cancer.The Bertolero family (John  Jill  Kevin and Justin) is the most selfless family we know  always going out of their way to help anyone and everyone -- now it's our turn to help them. As most of you know  they own their own business and work side-by-side every day. Having said that  you know that means having to pay out of pocket for their own health insurance. With Jill going undergoing chemotherapy and trips to Roswell Cancer Center in Buffalo  NY  both John and Jill will be missing work  thus making it difficult to afford the towering costs of cancer treatment.Your donation  no matter the amount  will greatly help with their medical expenses and everyday necessities. I know Jill  John and the boys mean the world to all of us  so what better way to show our love and support. But most of all  keep Jill in your prayers and help her beat this.

The Harms family knows this first-hand. And as their friends and family  we want to do all we can to help them get back on their feet  and to be able to stand through the storm they find themselves in.After serving the Lord faithfully for many years in Indonesia  Phil and Shelly Harms  together with their son Simon and daughter Sophie  had to suddenly return to the US. Their son Simon is in crisis  and needs emotional  spiritual and mental help. For the sake of the whole family they left behind their ministry  home  and life on the field  to come and get help in the best place possible.The medical costs are already beginning to add up – hospital care  therapists and other professionals  medicines  etc. Some of this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. And their health insurance was through Shelly’s teaching position overseas and does not cover anything here in the US. They will need to get insurance for the family here to help to pay for all these expenses – a huge expense in itself!And because this was so sudden  everything they own is still back in Indonesia. Phil will need to make a trip back to close out their home  sell what he can  and arrange to ship their household belongings back to the US. This alone will cost thousand dollars. And finding and renting a home in the Lakeland FL area will cost so much more than they have been paying overseas… and they need a car… and a myriad of other things!We are thankful for those of you who faithfully support their ministry each month – they will continue to need you more than ever. But the expenses already incurred and those coming will be far more than their usual ministry support income can handle. Frankly  they are overwhelmed!So many people have asked what they can do to help Phil and Shelly and the kids  and so as their ministry teammates and friends  we thought a campaign like this would be an easy way for friends and family to contribute to meet these overwhelming needs.All funds raised through this campaign have been set up for Phil and Shelly to have exclusive use and control of the funds for the family.One behalf of the Harms family  we would like to thank everyone for their love  prayers and support through this difficult time. May the Lord bless you richly! Mike & Heather Eastwood"

It’s hard showing up to my shifts and seeing my ray of sunshine slowly dimmer. Marco doesn’t want anyone to see him sick or in pain  he wants people to still see him smiling and happy. He wants to be healthy and be able to live a normal life  and \"be able to enjoy more than one slice of pizza a week.\"Due to unfortunate circumstances Marco does not qualify for health insurance to cover the cost for a kidney transplant and all the medications that come with it. The transplant would help Marco ditch the dyalisis clinics he has to attend three times a week  It would help get him closer to a more normal routine and most of all  it will help prolonggate his life.I can only wish everyone that reads this would meet Marco and see how he can light up anyone’s day.

She loves children and devotes a great deal of her time to them  especially those with special needs. Julia is also no stranger to the inside of Doctor’s offices and emergency rooms.In May of 2018  after years of medical appointments  tests  and frustration attempting to analyze what was thought to be random pain  Julia  was finally diagnosed with Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS) . This news was both a relief from the terror of having an invisible illness with no known cause and a new challenge for Julia.So what is AMPS? The short answer is an agonizing medical condition that can cause pain anywhere in the body. These episodes can be intermittent or constant and can affect the whole body or be localized to one area. The degree of pain children with AMPS experience is far more intense than one would normally expect. For Julia it manifests as extreme  constant pain in her lower extremities  frequent migraine headaches  and sporadic cases of Costochondritis. The pain in Julia's ankles and legs continues to increase despite physical therapy  and she is now using a wheelchair in order to attend school and to continue her advocacy and social justice work.Minor cases of AMPS can sometimes be treated with routine physical therapy and a daily workout routine. For more severe cases like Julia’s there are a number of AMPS pain clinics in the US. The closest to Julia’s home in Austin  TX is Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City  MO.Upon diagnosis Julia was placed on a 6 month wait list for the clinic. As luck would have it  a cancellation allow her to be evaluated there in September resulting in her acceptance into the clinic for treatment. Many calls to the clinic and insurance company later  Julia starts treatment on Monday  November 12th!The specialized treatment offered by these clinics involves much more intensive physical therapy to help her body break the continuous feedback loop of pain it has come to normalize. It’s a grueling process - and comes with an impressive 80% success rate - understandably leaving Julia both excited and nervous.On average  the treatment can extend anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks  which means Julia and one of her parents will be living in Kansas City for that time. We are hoping for a 4 week (or less) stay for Julia. She will be in treatment for 8 hours a day and living at the Ronald McDonald house near the hospital by night.After a seven year long struggle the end may finally be in sight! We ask that you please contribute what you are able to and/or share this campaign with friends and family. The funds donated to this campaign will be used to help pay for traveling to and from the clinic  housing in Kansas City  and other costs associated with Julia’s treatment that are not covered by her health insurance.To read more about/by Julia  take a peek at her website  Polite Rants ."

She is also a mother of three with two children still at home and one off to college.Marnie estimates her out of pocket costs for this injury to be a total of $15 000 by the time it’s done  plus many hundreds of dollars in incidental costs. Her recovery time is estimated to take 6-12 months.Marnie’s work at the Whidbey Institute is invaluable.

At this time  he is at UW Health Hospital in Madison  WI where he has been for the past 12 days. Nate has undergone Emergency Surgery stemming from this debilitating disease that quickly became life threatening. While we are very fortunate in many ways  high health care costs and the lack of paid family and medical leave have left him unable to afford this critical procedure and his regular occurring bills on his own. We're asking our community for support. Nate has been afflicted with stomach and bowel issues since he was a child. Over the years he has sought to find out what caused his pain with no clear results. Flares would come and he’d be given antibiotics by clinics and hospitals with the hopes that it would fix the problem  but still he had no idea what the problem was. Just before he turned 30 he finally had a diagnosis  Diverticulosis. Unfortunately for Nate  his diverticulitis flares continued regardless of changes in diet and exercise. On February 21st  Nate was in extreme pain from another diverticulitis flare and visited his local urgent care for antibiotics. On this visit the doctor expressed concern and sent for a CT scan to be done immediately. From there things spiraled into an unexpected direction  Nate was advised that the scans showed a lot of inflammation with several abscesses along with a large abscess which was perforating. He was checked into the ER and then admitted shortly thereafter. After 3 days in the hospital  another CT scan was completed and the doctors found that the infection had gotten much worse. Nate was rushed into Emergency Surgery on the 25 that which point they found that his colon had ruptured and the infection had caused so much inflammation to his colon that it had fused itself to his bladder. During surgery they removed his Sigmoid Colon and completed an Ostomy. Additionally  his colon had to be chipped away from his bladder causing damage to his bladder. His bladder was repaired and a Foley Catheter was placed to keep the bladder drained while it healed. As a result of the severity of the infection the surgeons were unable to stitch his incision up  instead the inside strength layer of the abdomen was closed and the 8 inch incision down the outside of his abdomen was left open with a few staples strategically placed on the skin layer. This will allow for the incision to slowly heal from the inside out. Since the surgery Nate has made progress towards healing  though slower than expected. The first 5 days after surgery were found to be the most difficult. The recovery period has been rough for him and has been accompanied by lots of abdominal pain from the incision as well as pressure from gas and bloating as his body learns to process foods again.At this point Nate is 9 days into his recovery from surgery and is working with the nurses and doctors at UW Health to learn at home care. In order to leave the hospital his white count has to be below 15 and his incision must be healing properly. Nate has currently missed about 2 weeks of work and will additionally miss another 2 weeks or more before he will be released to return to work. In 3 months he will have to undergo another surgery to have his colon re-attached to itself which will lead to an additional 2 weeks of missed work during the procedure and recovery. We are cautiously hopeful that under the care of these doctors  this surgery could be curative  freeing Nate from the debilitating pain that he has suffered from for many years. While we feel incredibly fortunate that Nate’s infection was caught before a more dire result  we need your support to help carry the financial burden of the surgery  hospital stay and multiple unforeseen missed days of work. Due to the high cost on his health insurance and at least six weeks of income that Nate will lose without access to paid family and medical leave  we are asking those who are willing and able to give to help him recover from this difficult time. Thank you for your love and support. If you've read this far  we're already grateful for your care and compassion. If you can't support financially  and would like to offer support in other ways  you are also appreciated  we are so thankful to have you in our lives."

As a result of her spinal cord injury  she is unable to stand  walk  transfer or negotiate steps without assistance.  She is wheelchair bound and will need caregiver assistance from her mother and support system.    This type of life change will not only effect Alesha's employment  but her mothers so that she can be available to care for Alesha.Funds will assist with paying bills  car payment & insurance premium  housing  medical treatment  therapy  counseling  rehab  adapting to life in a wheelchair.  There is no amount too little and it means a lot that people want to donate from the heart to support  Alesha and relieve some of the financial strain so she can focus on her recovery.Now this is not a letter begging for anything  it’s just a simple cry out for people of faith to gather together and tap in to all the resources we can to help a family that is in great need.

I am in need of a home to be moved into by February 15 2019 so time is CRITICAL!!!  I have challenged credit but I pay my rent and utilities on time. Possibly a 4-5-bedroom ranch style with a basement.  In need of wide doors that is wheelchair accessible with a walk-in shower in one of the bathrooms. We need the option of special accommodations and/or modifications to add a ramp to get my child in and out of the home. 2. Anyone who may have a MOVING COMPANY and would like to donate a truck for the move.3. People with resources on gently used handicap bathroom accessories (shower chair) to properly bathe and seat her.  4. Someone who has resources on ordering medical supplies in bulk that may come at a reasonable price. Things of that nature. 5.  Anyone with a mini-van for donation or sale (for a special price or payment arrangements) with or without a wheelchair lift.  We will need a spacious vehicle to transport Alesha in for therapy and doctor appointments for her continued care.

I have had the fortunate pleasure of recording and touring with acclaimed underdogs Clorox Girls  Red Dons  LA Drugz  Maniac  and Suspect Parts.As music doesn't pay the bills  I have worked dozens of jobs over the years  and recently became a full-time freelance American Sign Language interpreter. My mom  stepdad  and aunt are deaf  so I grew up immersed in Deaf culture and was able to sign before I could talk. After years of low-paying and soul destroying jobs (including a few excruciating years as a dental supply salesman)  I realized that I could have a rewarding profession working with the Deaf community.  It's going great so far  but as I'm freelance  my income isn't always stable and sometimes it can be difficult as most freelance agencies pay monthly on varying schedules. ASL Interpreting can be a potentially lucrative and fulfilling profession  but in this case I may need a bit of a running start.  So far so good though  some recent highlights include a couple of TV appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and Entertainment Tonight. To keep in shape  I play full court basketball with a group of writers  actors  comedians and a couple of semi-retired comedy writers who wrote for shows like Sanford and Son  Punky Brewster  Seinfeld  and Sister Sister.  One day I tore the meniscus in my left knee in two places and badly bruised my ACL.  At first I could barely walk  and while it did somewhat heal  the docs told me that I need surgery on my left knee or I'm at risk of constant inflammation and pain for the rest of my life. Right now I have discomfort and pain in my knee when climbing stairs  hills  long walks  or any kind of heavy lifting or prolonged physical activity. The docs have scheduled me for a meniscus repair surgery at 7am on Nov 7th 2018.I hope to one day be able to enjoy the physical activities I love again  including long walks  hikes  yoga  full court basketball  and of course a few high kicks onstage with my punk rock bands. I think I can get there with some surgery  physical therapy  and a little help from my friends.It's admittedly embarrassing and humbling to ask for help. I do have health insurance  and they will pay for 80% of my surgery  but I will have to pay about $3000 out of pocket  and I won't be able to work for 2-4 weeks. There will also be co-pays and additional cost for post-surgery physical therapy sessions.  As I'm 100% freelance  unpaid time off work will be very difficult financially. Right now its impossible for me to cover the surgery  related costs  and loss of income on my own. I'm hoping to raise $5K so that I can afford my surgery/medical bills  be prepared for physical therapy costs  and to help cover my bills for the 2-4 weeks I'm unable to work. For some people that might not be a lot of money  but to me it is huge and will help me bounce back. Really appreciate it everyone! Thank you very much for your help.  Lots of love.Your friend Justin Maurer www.justin-maurer.com"

The first surgery  in 2012  was to remove a large brain tumor (thankfully noncancerous). It was removed successfully  but complications required several months of difficult rehab. Then everything was fine until 2016  when I contracted an infection that went straight to my skull bones  some of which had to be removed and replaced with a metal mesh plate. This Thanksgiving  the metal plate itself became infected and had to be removed. In a second operation  a plastic surgeon covered the area temporarily with a “free flap” made from a skin graft. In 3-6 months  when there is no risk of further infection and the flap is completely healed  I will get a 3-d printed plastic skull plate in one last operation. I don’t really mind losing what little hair I have left (I like colorful scarves)  or even having to wear a silly helmet for several months (I’ve done it before!). But being out of commission for months each time means that it takes that much longer to get back up to speed with life and especially work – and that’s what really worries me. Each time  my life gets put on hold. It’s scary. I have lots of really wonderful  supportive friends  whom I’m tremendously grateful for  but I don’t have a spouse or partner to help with the bills  so I’m on my own. Since I work by the hour  when I’m not working  I’m not earning a living. I am an artist and art teacher  and I love what I do. I work part time for ACE – Adult and Community Enrichment at Suncoast Technical College. I went though my meager savings during the two previous episodes in 2012 and 2016  and have not been able to replenish that “rainy day fund.” I’m trying to figure out what I can do to generate additional income with artwork or something else to give me a buffer against future downtime  but in the meantime  I have to get past this current bump in the road. That’s why I started this GoFundMe page. My small Social Security check will take care of a few vital bills such as my health insurance premium and utilities  but in a couple of weeks I’ll be pretty much out of money until mid-March when a little teaching income comes in again from the classes that start in February. I expect to need about $2000 to help cover the mortgage and expenses for two months until I’m up to speed again. I’m working hard in physical therapy to build my strength and stamina so that I can go back to my job with full strength.

I do not know if you have experienced cancer within your family or close loved ones  but it is not the most exciting news especially when it is your Father/Best Friend. Watching someone you use to go jog and exercise with to not being able to walk across a room or do the simple things like get ready or shower at home without stopping to catch their breath from lack of oxygen in lungs is horrific and devastating. I love my father and as much as I can do anything for him physically him not being able to DJ/work full time and having no health insurance has taken a toll on his income and living situation is very hard and rough right now. My family and I are praying and hoping that God restore his health and get this process going so that it takes less stress off of him financially and physically. My family and I please ask if you can pray for his health and finances and to donate anything at all to help him in his time of need that you pray hard about it and if you can help us support him financially during this hard time for us all then please do so. I and my Father have been hard on myself to ask for help during this time as I and my Father never want to ask for help  but the amount of finances he has taken on just my Family and I just can't endure alone. We Love him very much and want to help him so please if you can find it in your hearts to give a little for my Father we ask that you please donate and also pray for his health and recovery.

Karen is a loving and devoted wife and mother  as anyone who has spent any time with Karen would know  always putting the needs of her family first. Karen is the type of person who you can count on to lift you up when you're down  and never expects anything in return.6-months ago  Karen was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through her initial diagnosis and surgery with a positive and courageous mindset  and returned to her caregiver role at work and in her personal life soon after the first phase of treatment (despite her family and friends and colleagues concern).  The second phase of treatment approaching  Karen's health insurance provider declined her oncologist's request for Proton Beam Therapy as an alternative to radiation and chemotherapy.  The short and long term health effects differ significantly between the two types of treatment.   Despite Karen's oncology team at Loma Linda University Hospital recommending her as an ideal candidate for Proton Beam Therapy to eradicate the cancer from her body   she was declined by corporate insurance. She persisted  going through the appeals processes  always the opimist with a positive and courageous mindset.Karen believed that the insurance would do the right thing when presented with the medical evidence from her providers.  That did not occur.  Soon after the final appeal was denied  she met with the Proton Beam Therapy program from Loma Linda University Hospital  and was informed that the cost of Proton Beam Therapy as a private pay patient would be $27 000.   Karen and her family were faced with a hard decision between two options  both with significant risks.  Ultimately  and with the encouragement of loved ones  they chose the financial risk over the long-term global health risks associated with the radiation and chemotherapy option covered by the insurance plan. Karen and Craig are nearing retirement  and have three college aged children.   As the ever generous and giving caregiver  Karen is in need of some support from her loved ones and extended community of friends and colleagues.  Every little bit goes a long way in supporting a woman whose life is devoted to the well being of others.  The goal of this campaign is to reduce the financial stress and impact of private pay cancer treatment on Karen and her family. A reduction of stress will allow Karen to focus her energy on healing  giving her the best chance to respond favorably and rapidly to her treatment.  Please help us in our support of Karen Armstrong."

She is an extremely active  hardworking  and outgoing elementary teacher that has completely lost her ability to work! She spends her year working in the states and her summers teaching abroad and traveling. In October of 2018  she was diagnosed with Varicella-Zoster Meningitis  which was found after a lumbar puncture and it indicated that she had 388 White Blood Cells in her cerebral-spinal fluid. Neurologists begin to worry when the white blood cell count is at 10!!Her infectious disease doctor has clearly stated that she could have been paralyzed or died if she didn't get to the ER any sooner! Between the various infectious disease doctors and multiple neurologists that have looked into her case  NONE of them have seen a case like Donna's before. In other words  she basically grew shingles in her brain! As of now  doctors are still trying to figure out how to treat the patient's rare form of Varicella-Zoster Meningitis  but with very little literature/studies done on this diagnosis  it has been difficult. Most patients with Meningitis are treated for 7-10 days with IV antibiotic  but Donna is currently at 37 days of aggressive treatment through a picc line to her heart with routine doctors visits. Her RARE form of Meningitis has caused more complication with her case. Recently  she was diagnosed with Left Hemiparesis and TRANSVERSE MYELITIS (VERY UNCOMMON)  which was caused after a mini stroke on 11-16-2018 and she was admitted to the Neurology unit at IMC. She has spent a total of 30+ days in the hospital  continues to make trips to the ER  (due to nerve damage) among other things  and has lost her mobility on the left side of her body. As well as  having difficulty with immediate memory loss  sensitivity to light (explains the sunglasses)  and fine motor skills (can not text for longer than 10 minutes or write with a pen). She is currently on home health nursing  has trouble keeping food down  is using a walker  has occupational therapy  physical therapy  behavioral health counseling and continues IV treatment  among several other daily prescription medications. She went from teaching and traveling around the world to save/protect animals to being a girl that's trapped in an \"old man's body \" as she would say. On top of everything else  she is losing all of her hair and we all know how beautiful her naturally long hair is and how much she LOVES it. She's been a warrior through all of this  but losing her hair has been tough! Along with missing the entire holiday season  starting with Halloween and now we are almost to Christmas but things are not looking up. Missing Halloween was a hard pill for Donna's creative self to swallow  since she has two awesome costumes for this year  but having to go to the ER on Thanksgiving was even more earth shattering for her. It was bad enough that she did not get to spend her Thanksgiving cooking up a storm as usual  but even worse with the nerve pain and the inability to even sit down or to hug anyone due to the extreme pain she is enduring!! Her birthday is coming up in just a few days and this will be her worst/saddest birthday to date. The holiday season will pass her by and although she continues to stay as positive as she can  we all know this has jaded her spirit. Please send positive vibes her way! We need all the love and support she can get! As of now  DP is drowning in medical bills and is physically and mentally (memory loss) unable to work. Losing her ability to work has most certainly hit her hard because she LOVES her job more than anything else in the world.  It is now up the neurologists and Donna's rehab recovery progress  for the coming year. She is a young female living in the state of Utah where she is not able to collect any kind of short term or long term disability due to her age and is not making any income at all. She has no idea how she is going to pay for her next health insurance premium  phone bill  car insurance  rent  or even utilities. Getting Medicaid has been a serious issue in the state of Utah! There is no specific timeline on how long her disabilities will continue  but the doctors at Johns Hopkins  in Maryland  have suggested that it should take 6 months. We are praying for a full vision  physical  and hopefully full brain recovery as well! D's memory and concentration loss has been the most difficult part of this process for her. ANY AND ALL HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND DP WOULD BE FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR YOU! At this point she has spent all of her savings to pay for her health insurance premiums  which are super high and has no financial support in other ways. PLEASE help us RAISE 'TM' AWARENESS and DO IT FOR D!!!! THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! --WITH LOVE  P.S.The funds from this Campaign will be withdrawn to get D through physical therapy and pay for her rent while she is unable to work.My name is Zar and I am D’s significant other  I have been helping her through this healing process and I will be facilitating the funds to her.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼\"Life is about the journey  not the destination.\" -Anne Coleman"

journey in his 27 years on this earth!  Its time to help him become more comfortable in this life by allowing him to eat properly  not hurt so much and fully smile again!!  Its been over two decades since he last smiled a toothy grin.  Why?  When Trevor was just past his 4th birthday he was having trouble sleeping at night.  One night his breathing was stopping and we took him to the ER.  Soon the nightmare began when we were greeted by an Oncologist and told our precious son had a very rare and aggressive cancer.  It turned out he had stage 3 Rhabdomyosarcoma which was inoperable and wrapped all through his sinus cavity and growing down his throat.  Research told us this was very serious and he may have had at the time about a 20% chance of survival. Since it was so aggressive and fast moving  he had a very aggressive treatment regime which started immediately with a maximum dosage of radiation treatments to his head/face.  We were warned by the radiologist that the procedure would be effective in knocking the cancer down but would cause various side effects such as scarring in his throat   mouth and sinus area  damage to his teeth  damage to his facial bones and damage to his pituitary gland and hypothalamus. The radiation was a success and really knocked the cancer down to a point where the next year of chemotherapy could potentially knock it out.  However the radiation was devastating and burned his mouth so badly it was charred black and he was IV fed for a few months.  He had received the maximum dosage of radiation (RADS) over many many treatments.  He was such a trooper and the secret of his success and survival was his tremendously high pain tolerance  tolerance of the medications and his strong resolve to live and do what he was told.  During 1996 Trevor nearly passed away three times due to medication allergies and infections but emerged on the other side still alive.  Since 1996  Trevor has graduated from High School  taken some college classes  earned his Eagle Scout award and is a fine fine young man we all are very proud of.  His love of the wilderness and the mountains keeps him living in a converted van currently in Salt Lake City.  Previously he's lived in Jackson WY and Breckenridge CO.  He is a gifted rock climber and photographer and he see's the world thru very old experienced tranquil eyes that have fought and fought and seen and experienced things no one should have to endure.  He recently picked to live  work and climb in Salt Lake City because one of the most talented surgical prosthodontists resides there and is going to help Trevor with some of the after-effects of his treatment that he struggles with.  Most adults have 18 teeth on our top jaw and 18 on the bottom.  Trevor has only 7 on top as many have fallen out or never came in.  The radiation basically froze his face and lower head into the size and maturity of a 4 year old.  Many of his adult teeth never came in  a number of his baby teeth never fell out until they broke apart and the adult teeth he did have had their roots shortened by the treatment making them all lose.  Four teeth are still up sideways in his gums.  Trevor struggles to eat  has constant pain and just doesn't smile due to the mess he would show if he did.  This Go Fund Me is to raise the funding necessary to remove the last 7 teeth he has plus the 4 that are up in his gums causing pain.  He will receive this treatment as soon as the monies are raised!!  Health insurance won't cover this nor dental due to annual cost limits.  The surgeon will put 4 posts into his jaw bone and put specially fabricated bridges in so that when done Trevor will have a mouth of teeth to be proud of!  His palate is very narrow and small so everything is extra challenging.  The proceeds will pay for his treatment  pay to get him into a hotel room for a week or so to recover so he has clean water  bedding and facilities and allow a family member to fly out and help him during and after surgery.  This won't be the end of Trevor's daily struggles but will at least allow him to eat the foods he wants and reduce his pain levels.  He still is stared at constantly by kids and adults which can be very hurtful to Trevor but kudos to him for living his life and letting most troubles roll of his back.  He even had a man the other day in Georgia get in his face and ask him point blank why he looks like he does.  The guy wasn't even nice about it.  When I'm with Trevor I'm continually blown away by his grace  poise and strength as in the end he is thankful to be alive and thankful for his wonderful life.  He mourns everyday the loss of so many of his friends that weren't as lucky as he to survive this scourge we call pediatric cancer   Thank you for giving what you can to Trevor and please please in the future give to charities that focus on pediatric cancer research and support!  It's badly overlooked and so many kids suffer each and everyday along with their parents and friends."

On March  1st  Jane was diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer that has unfortunately spread to other areas in her body. At this stage  there is no cure or treatment that will make it better.  In her lifetime  she's played many roles - from a guardian to a gatekeeper  a concierge of smiles  a master of music with a song for every occasion - to her most critically acclaimed role - a loving mother of 3 grown children  and grandmother. This diagnosis comes with the understanding that there are only a few weeks or months left before she makes her way to the heavens. This news has been devastating  as nothing can prepare you for the finality of cancer  the hopelessness of treatment options  or the grief that sets in as you realize: This. Is. It. The only thing we can do now is take it a day at a time  and make each day a celebration of life with her loved ones. She has spent her entire life taking care of others  putting her needs last  and offering a welcoming heart to anyone that needed it without question. My wish for her is to know how much she is loved and what an impact she has made along the way.To support her transition into the next life  we are raising funds to cover living expenses and medical costs. Due to the diagnosis  she will no longer be able to work and her health insurance will no longer be covered by her current job. Myself  and my siblings have begun to take over her bills and put together a bucket list of memories to make before her last curtain call. Aside from financial donations  I'd like to start collecting greeting cards to brighten her days with; words of encouragement  a shared memory  or some humor to keep things light as we go down this difficult road together."

I went though my meager savings during the two previous episodes in 2012 and 2016  and have not been able to replenish that “rainy day fund.” I’m trying to figure out what I can do to generate additional income with artwork or something else to give me a buffer against future downtime  but in the meantime  I have to get past this current bump in the road. That’s why I started this GoFundMe page. My small Social Security check will take care of a few vital bills such as my health insurance premium and utilities  but in a couple of weeks I’ll be pretty much out of money until mid-March when a little teaching income comes in again from the classes that start in February. I expect to need about $2000 to help cover the mortgage and expenses for two months until I’m up to speed again. I’m working hard in physical therapy to build my strength and stamina so that I can go back to my job with full strength.

I do not know if you have experienced cancer within your family or close loved ones  but it is not the most exciting news especially when it is your Father/Best Friend. Watching someone you use to go jog and exercise with to not being able to walk across a room or do the simple things like get ready or shower at home without stopping to catch their breath from lack of oxygen in lungs is horrific and devastating. I love my father and as much as I can do anything for him physically him not being able to DJ/work full time and having no health insurance has taken a toll on his income and living situation is very hard and rough right now. My family and I are praying and hoping that God restore his health and get this process going so that it takes less stress off of him financially and physically. My family and I please ask if you can pray for his health and finances and to donate anything at all to help him in his time of need that you pray hard about it and if you can help us support him financially during this hard time for us all then please do so. I and my Father have been hard on myself to ask for help during this time as I and my Father never want to ask for help  but the amount of finances he has taken on just my Family and I just can't endure alone. We Love him very much and want to help him so please if you can find it in your hearts to give a little for my Father we ask that you please donate and also pray for his health and recovery.

Karen is a loving and devoted wife and mother  as anyone who has spent any time with Karen would know  always putting the needs of her family first. Karen is the type of person who you can count on to lift you up when you're down  and never expects anything in return.6-months ago  Karen was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through her initial diagnosis and surgery with a positive and courageous mindset  and returned to her caregiver role at work and in her personal life soon after the first phase of treatment (despite her family and friends and colleagues concern).  The second phase of treatment approaching  Karen's health insurance provider declined her oncologist's request for Proton Beam Therapy as an alternative to radiation and chemotherapy.  The short and long term health effects differ significantly between the two types of treatment.   Despite Karen's oncology team at Loma Linda University Hospital recommending her as an ideal candidate for Proton Beam Therapy to eradicate the cancer from her body   she was declined by corporate insurance. She persisted  going through the appeals processes  always the opimist with a positive and courageous mindset.Karen believed that the insurance would do the right thing when presented with the medical evidence from her providers.  That did not occur.  Soon after the final appeal was denied  she met with the Proton Beam Therapy program from Loma Linda University Hospital  and was informed that the cost of Proton Beam Therapy as a private pay patient would be $27 000.   Karen and her family were faced with a hard decision between two options  both with significant risks.  Ultimately  and with the encouragement of loved ones  they chose the financial risk over the long-term global health risks associated with the radiation and chemotherapy option covered by the insurance plan. Karen and Craig are nearing retirement  and have three college aged children.   As the ever generous and giving caregiver  Karen is in need of some support from her loved ones and extended community of friends and colleagues.  Every little bit goes a long way in supporting a woman whose life is devoted to the well being of others.  The goal of this campaign is to reduce the financial stress and impact of private pay cancer treatment on Karen and her family. A reduction of stress will allow Karen to focus her energy on healing  giving her the best chance to respond favorably and rapidly to her treatment.  Please help us in our support of Karen Armstrong."

She is an extremely active  hardworking  and outgoing elementary teacher that has completely lost her ability to work! She spends her year working in the states and her summers teaching abroad and traveling. In October of 2018  she was diagnosed with Varicella-Zoster Meningitis  which was found after a lumbar puncture and it indicated that she had 388 White Blood Cells in her cerebral-spinal fluid. Neurologists begin to worry when the white blood cell count is at 10!!Her infectious disease doctor has clearly stated that she could have been paralyzed or died if she didn't get to the ER any sooner! Between the various infectious disease doctors and multiple neurologists that have looked into her case  NONE of them have seen a case like Donna's before. In other words  she basically grew shingles in her brain! As of now  doctors are still trying to figure out how to treat the patient's rare form of Varicella-Zoster Meningitis  but with very little literature/studies done on this diagnosis  it has been difficult. Most patients with Meningitis are treated for 7-10 days with IV antibiotic  but Donna is currently at 37 days of aggressive treatment through a picc line to her heart with routine doctors visits. Her RARE form of Meningitis has caused more complication with her case. Recently  she was diagnosed with Left Hemiparesis and TRANSVERSE MYELITIS (VERY UNCOMMON)  which was caused after a mini stroke on 11-16-2018 and she was admitted to the Neurology unit at IMC. She has spent a total of 30+ days in the hospital  continues to make trips to the ER  (due to nerve damage) among other things  and has lost her mobility on the left side of her body. As well as  having difficulty with immediate memory loss  sensitivity to light (explains the sunglasses)  and fine motor skills (can not text for longer than 10 minutes or write with a pen). She is currently on home health nursing  has trouble keeping food down  is using a walker  has occupational therapy  physical therapy  behavioral health counseling and continues IV treatment  among several other daily prescription medications. She went from teaching and traveling around the world to save/protect animals to being a girl that's trapped in an \"old man's body \" as she would say. On top of everything else  she is losing all of her hair and we all know how beautiful her naturally long hair is and how much she LOVES it. She's been a warrior through all of this  but losing her hair has been tough! Along with missing the entire holiday season  starting with Halloween and now we are almost to Christmas but things are not looking up. Missing Halloween was a hard pill for Donna's creative self to swallow  since she has two awesome costumes for this year  but having to go to the ER on Thanksgiving was even more earth shattering for her. It was bad enough that she did not get to spend her Thanksgiving cooking up a storm as usual  but even worse with the nerve pain and the inability to even sit down or to hug anyone due to the extreme pain she is enduring!! Her birthday is coming up in just a few days and this will be her worst/saddest birthday to date. The holiday season will pass her by and although she continues to stay as positive as she can  we all know this has jaded her spirit. Please send positive vibes her way! We need all the love and support she can get! As of now  DP is drowning in medical bills and is physically and mentally (memory loss) unable to work. Losing her ability to work has most certainly hit her hard because she LOVES her job more than anything else in the world.  It is now up the neurologists and Donna's rehab recovery progress  for the coming year. She is a young female living in the state of Utah where she is not able to collect any kind of short term or long term disability due to her age and is not making any income at all. She has no idea how she is going to pay for her next health insurance premium  phone bill  car insurance  rent  or even utilities. Getting Medicaid has been a serious issue in the state of Utah! There is no specific timeline on how long her disabilities will continue  but the doctors at Johns Hopkins  in Maryland  have suggested that it should take 6 months. We are praying for a full vision  physical  and hopefully full brain recovery as well! D's memory and concentration loss has been the most difficult part of this process for her. ANY AND ALL HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND DP WOULD BE FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR YOU! At this point she has spent all of her savings to pay for her health insurance premiums  which are super high and has no financial support in other ways. PLEASE help us RAISE 'TM' AWARENESS and DO IT FOR D!!!! THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! --WITH LOVE  P.S.The funds from this Campaign will be withdrawn to get D through physical therapy and pay for her rent while she is unable to work.My name is Zar and I am D’s significant other  I have been helping her through this healing process and I will be facilitating the funds to her.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼\"Life is about the journey  not the destination.\" -Anne Coleman"

journey in his 27 years on this earth!  Its time to help him become more comfortable in this life by allowing him to eat properly  not hurt so much and fully smile again!!  Its been over two decades since he last smiled a toothy grin.  Why?  When Trevor was just past his 4th birthday he was having trouble sleeping at night.  One night his breathing was stopping and we took him to the ER.  Soon the nightmare began when we were greeted by an Oncologist and told our precious son had a very rare and aggressive cancer.  It turned out he had stage 3 Rhabdomyosarcoma which was inoperable and wrapped all through his sinus cavity and growing down his throat.  Research told us this was very serious and he may have had at the time about a 20% chance of survival. Since it was so aggressive and fast moving  he had a very aggressive treatment regime which started immediately with a maximum dosage of radiation treatments to his head/face.  We were warned by the radiologist that the procedure would be effective in knocking the cancer down but would cause various side effects such as scarring in his throat   mouth and sinus area  damage to his teeth  damage to his facial bones and damage to his pituitary gland and hypothalamus. The radiation was a success and really knocked the cancer down to a point where the next year of chemotherapy could potentially knock it out.  However the radiation was devastating and burned his mouth so badly it was charred black and he was IV fed for a few months.  He had received the maximum dosage of radiation (RADS) over many many treatments.  He was such a trooper and the secret of his success and survival was his tremendously high pain tolerance  tolerance of the medications and his strong resolve to live and do what he was told.  During 1996 Trevor nearly passed away three times due to medication allergies and infections but emerged on the other side still alive.  Since 1996  Trevor has graduated from High School  taken some college classes  earned his Eagle Scout award and is a fine fine young man we all are very proud of.  His love of the wilderness and the mountains keeps him living in a converted van currently in Salt Lake City.  Previously he's lived in Jackson WY and Breckenridge CO.  He is a gifted rock climber and photographer and he see's the world thru very old experienced tranquil eyes that have fought and fought and seen and experienced things no one should have to endure.  He recently picked to live  work and climb in Salt Lake City because one of the most talented surgical prosthodontists resides there and is going to help Trevor with some of the after-effects of his treatment that he struggles with.  Most adults have 18 teeth on our top jaw and 18 on the bottom.  Trevor has only 7 on top as many have fallen out or never came in.  The radiation basically froze his face and lower head into the size and maturity of a 4 year old.  Many of his adult teeth never came in  a number of his baby teeth never fell out until they broke apart and the adult teeth he did have had their roots shortened by the treatment making them all lose.  Four teeth are still up sideways in his gums.  Trevor struggles to eat  has constant pain and just doesn't smile due to the mess he would show if he did.  This Go Fund Me is to raise the funding necessary to remove the last 7 teeth he has plus the 4 that are up in his gums causing pain.  He will receive this treatment as soon as the monies are raised!!  Health insurance won't cover this nor dental due to annual cost limits.  The surgeon will put 4 posts into his jaw bone and put specially fabricated bridges in so that when done Trevor will have a mouth of teeth to be proud of!  His palate is very narrow and small so everything is extra challenging.  The proceeds will pay for his treatment  pay to get him into a hotel room for a week or so to recover so he has clean water  bedding and facilities and allow a family member to fly out and help him during and after surgery.  This won't be the end of Trevor's daily struggles but will at least allow him to eat the foods he wants and reduce his pain levels.  He still is stared at constantly by kids and adults which can be very hurtful to Trevor but kudos to him for living his life and letting most troubles roll of his back.  He even had a man the other day in Georgia get in his face and ask him point blank why he looks like he does.  The guy wasn't even nice about it.  When I'm with Trevor I'm continually blown away by his grace  poise and strength as in the end he is thankful to be alive and thankful for his wonderful life.  He mourns everyday the loss of so many of his friends that weren't as lucky as he to survive this scourge we call pediatric cancer   Thank you for giving what you can to Trevor and please please in the future give to charities that focus on pediatric cancer research and support!  It's badly overlooked and so many kids suffer each and everyday along with their parents and friends."

On March  1st  Jane was diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer that has unfortunately spread to other areas in her body. At this stage  there is no cure or treatment that will make it better.  In her lifetime  she's played many roles - from a guardian to a gatekeeper  a concierge of smiles  a master of music with a song for every occasion - to her most critically acclaimed role - a loving mother of 3 grown children  and grandmother. This diagnosis comes with the understanding that there are only a few weeks or months left before she makes her way to the heavens. This news has been devastating  as nothing can prepare you for the finality of cancer  the hopelessness of treatment options  or the grief that sets in as you realize: This. Is. It. The only thing we can do now is take it a day at a time  and make each day a celebration of life with her loved ones. She has spent her entire life taking care of others  putting her needs last  and offering a welcoming heart to anyone that needed it without question. My wish for her is to know how much she is loved and what an impact she has made along the way.To support her transition into the next life  we are raising funds to cover living expenses and medical costs. Due to the diagnosis  she will no longer be able to work and her health insurance will no longer be covered by her current job. Myself  and my siblings have begun to take over her bills and put together a bucket list of memories to make before her last curtain call. Aside from financial donations  I'd like to start collecting greeting cards to brighten her days with; words of encouragement  a shared memory  or some humor to keep things light as we go down this difficult road together."

Shock was followed by disbelief. This is a rarer and very difficult cancer to cure – Multiple Myeloma and it is in the serious advanced stage 3. MIRs of my chest and back exposed the large number of myeloma cells present as lesions all over my bones. A PET scan was able to show just how extensive and invasive the cancer is in the bones of my body. Additionally  I had a bone marrow biopsy of my left hip which revealed that it is 95 % infected. This nasty cancer has caused me to have severe pain throughout my chest and back  intense fatigue  extreme muscle weakness  limitation of mobility  and a complete lack of energy and stamina. It is very difficult for me to get up and down due to the pain and the instability of the bones. Thus  I am no longer able to work. I was a hard working truck driver and this job required heavy lifting. It is impossible for me to earn a living now. I am on chemotherapy of Velcade  Dexamethasone  and Revlimid for 5 to 6 months. The chemo is directed against the myeloma cells but it also is used to help with the intense pain associated with this cancer. I am also receiving an injection of Xgeva monthly to help delay or prevent the weakening of my bones. When the chemo is completed I will have to undergo a Stem Cell Transplant. This requires a stay of a month in the hospital. If it is successful then I will remain on the cancer drugs for another two years. The initial treatment plan can be more than 2 ½ years if the Stem Cell Treatment is successful. If it isn’t successful the first time it could be 4 years or more of battling this horrific cancer.I am now paying for health insurance myself and will be responsible for the out-of-pocket and co-pay expenses for the current year and the new subsequent health insurance plan for next year - this will be about $7  000 to $8 000 up front. The costs for chemo are $12 000 to $17 000 a month and Cobra Insurance will be $700 plus a month. Horror stories of health care companies simply dropping you because it is costing them too much money are prevalent. I have already received two letters with disclaimers of responsibility of payment for chemo medication and a notification that they are not paying. We are fighting that decision. Peter J. Pitts  president of a division at the Center for Medicine stated  “Drug coverage denials are a deadly prescription for people with cancer.” On Nov. 1  2018  I applied for Social Security Disability. I was told by them that it will be at least five or six months but my doctor said that it can take a year or more. All that time with no income and large amounts of money going out constantly is overwhelming. I am hopeful of obtaining enough money right away to help get me through the first five or six months and maybe even the Stem Cell Treatment. If you could help I would be grateful. - Pentti Allan Kahkonen and wife Delores"

This involves 3 separate surgeries over the course of 6 months  an ostomy and a rough road of recovery each time.  She has been dealing with incredible pain and if you know anything about UC  you know all of the horrible symptoms of this bowel disease but also what effect the medicines take on a body.  She has lost 35 pounds in a few months because she can't keep things down  or the opposite  her body keeps things in and her colon gets infected and she bloats.  Through all of this she has tried to stay strong!  She has made sure she attended the family birthday parties  sending care packages to her baby brother  Christopher  who is deployed till 2016  supporting her sister-in-law in any way she can with the nephews and niece.  She raises funds for so many worthwhile causes because she believes in helping find a cure for those diseases that affect and have affected those she loves - Liver foundation donations in honor of her cousin Olivia; Diabetes in honor of her grandmother Ellen Gipson; Asthma  in honor of her mother(humbly  me); UC  herself and several siblings; Crohn's  'Amber Tyson  and so many people I can't name; Cancer  her grandmother and so many others; Multiple Sclerosis  her wonderful uncle Joseph Gipson;  Heart Association in honor of her grandfathers and father ;and so many others I can't count.  She has raised tens of thousands of dollars in the past 10 years for so many organizations.  Now  she needs people to help her.  She would never ask for this herself.  I think she'd sooner scream at the sky by herself than ask for help.  So I'm asking for her.  She is now at the point of exhausting her short-term disability benefits  and has been paying her own health insurance premiums since her company has stopped doing so because she's on disability.   As of November 26  she will no longer have any disability  and yet she'll still have to pay for her health insurance premiums  in order to get the next 2 required surgeries.  She has exhausted her savings with her medical bills  medications and living expenses.I believe that $5 000 is a good goal  a decent goal  that will help her pay for her health insurance  her medications  ostomy supplies  costs of living and the costs of getting well for the next six months.  This beautiful young woman has been through so much and hasn't asked for anything but gives to everyone. Anything you can give would be appreciated.  Let's help her get back on her feet so she can start giving back again  which is what she does best.Thank you Judy"

We all know and love Kylee and right now she needs our help. In September  Kylee travelled to St Louis with Anthony to see Taylor Swift on the Reputation World Tour when her appendix started rotting inside of her body. This meant that she had to go to the emergency room the night before the show and ended up not being able to see Taylor. Kylee loves Taylor so much and Taylor has been there for her through really hard times over the last few years  so it was devastating. However  her worries were far from over. Her appendix issue was the worst that her surgeon had ever seen  causing the infection to leak into other parts of her body and making Kylee borderline septic which nearly landed her in the ICU. So after the operation  Kylee took a long time to heal  her antibiotics weren’t working  and they had to put a tube in my stomach and a PICC line in her arm which lasted for weeks and put her pretty much out of commission for way longer than most people would have been. This was obviously a painful and depressing and all around terrible experience which nobody deserves  but especially not Kylee.At the time she had health insurance through her work  but she no longer works at that particular job so she now has had to depend on government funded insurance  which is  to be frank  terrible. Her bills total over $42 000. She can’t afford it. She was worrying to me about what she’s going to do and I suggested making a gofundme  but she said she could never ask people for money. Well  I’m asking for her. Kylee is not and has never been wealthy but since I’ve known her she’s been generous to a fault  always sharing what little she has with others. Only just recently a mutual friend had a loved one pass away very unexpectedly and  despite having all this  debt  Kylee organised for us all to send this person flowers so they knew we were thinking of them. She’s always thinking of others and what she can do to make people’s lives better and I think it’s about time for us others to do the same for her. Don’t worry if you can’t donate much (or at all)  just know that every little bit helps. Please donate if you’re able to. Kylee almost didn’t even let me make this because she felt so guilty about asking people for money but that’s exactly why she deserves it."

He thought he was paying on a life insurance policy  only to find  unfortunately  that it was an accidental and dismemberment policy instead  which could lead my sister  mother  dog and I  homeless.My dad was a good husband and father. My parents agreed that my mother would be a stay at home mom. She has never missed any of our school functions and was a volunteer at our school for many years.Due to these recent traumatic events  my mom's anxiety disorder has gotten worse  and without any help  I’m afraid that my mother may become ill and she has no health insurance.My father served in the U.S. Army for six years and then pursued as a career Military contract work. He has always had a great love for God  his family  and country.If anyone can help us... PLEASE... it would be a great blessing to a family in need."

He had appointments with the doctor multiple times and was told first he had pneumonia and then COPD. He followed all the directives  but it became clear the medications weren’t helping him.   Rhiannon and I were stunned when we were told he did not have COPD. He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. The emergency room doctor told us he came all too close to death. His heart was damaged  but his prognosis is good. His heart is expected to heal itself over the next 3 to 4 months. His lungs are healing too  and his breathing is not as labored as it was in December. He no longer requires oxygen and his health is improving each day. We are grateful he will make an almost full recovery. We are also grateful our health insurance will cover almost all his medical bills. To make matters even more complicated I was admitted to the hospital in another emergency in early January. I’ve recovered and my medical expenses are also covered.The problem is Robin is unable to work in his studio or continue the work with Spanish mustangs that he has been doing for decades. It's already been two and a half months and our emergency funds have been depleted. We cannot make all the ends meet  especially since Robin’s recovery will be 3 – 4 more months. We are self-employed in a family business which is impacted by Robin’s absence. Each day it is expected that he’ll be able to do more  but we are hoping you will help us buy time for his recovery.It’s humbling to be in a situation such as this. We are having trouble buying firewood  food  and everyday expenses  along with paying our utility bills. Please help us with a donation so we can make ends meet until that happy day in May or June when Robin is back on his feet and in his studio building beautiful furniture and screen doors and working in the corral with his Spanish mustangs  Arapaho and Ruby.  Our gratitude runs very deep.Thank you INCENTIVESAll donors will receive a digital copy of The Roan Mare by Robin Doughman.We are pleased to offer incentives for large donations.

Last week we interviewed with Dr. Dan LaPerriere  the lead doc at Front Range Functional Medicine and we are encouraged to hear that he believes David's brain health can be restored.Here is Dr. Dan's website:  https://frontrangefunctionalmedicine.comDr. Dan describes the benefits of the protocol on his website as follows: There has been no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. However  new research shows that we can intervene by addressing the various causes of brain inflammation and restore healthy brain function especially if this is found early on. Dr LaPerriere is a certified practitioner in Dr Bredesen’s reversing cognitive decline protocol.As a family we have always believed in the power of preventative and natural medicine. However many of the natural modalities  including the functional medicine approach  are not covered by health insurance.  Presently  David is undergoing extensive brain imaging and cognitive tests  genetic tests and other lab work involved in getting to the core of David's particular illness. The tests and intensive treatments are expensive.  We are reaching out to our community  friends and family who can  and would like to contribute to our GoFundMeCampaign   Reversing David's Cognitive Decline. David's condition is at a critical stage; one that offers hope of reversal.  He and our family are choosing to  be part of the leading edge in personalized natural medicine; not only to help David but to help others come to understand how diseases once thought irreversible can be treated with these new research-based  innovative modalities. Initial tests and interviews with Dr. Dan at Front Range Functional Medicine in Louisville Colorado will start the week of February 25  2019  six days after David's 67th birthday. The Reversing Cognitive Decline program is ongoing for the next year and will cost approximately $11 000 directly to Front Range Functional Medicine. An additional several thousand dollars is needed for out of pocket costs for nutritional and lifestyle change and support.  David worked hard all his life as a fruit sales and marketing entrepreneur to support his family. Due to his decline in health for the past 3 years he has exhausted his savings. It is with much love  optimism  and gratitude that we ask you to contribute to help David and us  his family  through this health challenge."

The cancer treatment process has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs since it began. Like most cancer fighters  Andy has lost most of his hair  battles sickness and exhaustion on a daily basis  and is trying to keep working in between his treatments. To catch up on the current medical and treatment situation details check out his Caring Bridge site here. https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/andyfawleyThe latest news is that Andy and Patty have traveled down to MD Anderson Cancer Hospital in Houston  Texas where Andy has been accepted into a clinical trial. This is exciting and brings a bit of hope  but also a good amount of stress and concern. The logistics of the visit are difficult to coordinate and they are doing what they can to try and make this treatment cycle as smooth as possible. The clinical trail that Andy has been accepted into will be quite rigorous with a treatment once a week for one month that comes with a lengthy list of side effects.  We are hoping for the best but at this time we have no way to know how he will respond. This treatment will require staying near MD Anderson Hospital in Houston  Texas. Thankfully  Andy and Patty have been connected to an organization that offers lower cost housing but that still adds up over the whole month of treatment. Patty has been using her family medical leave from work in order to be by Andy's side through this fight  but in order to pay for the regular bills  health insurance  medical bills  food  and the lodging in Texas they will need a miracle.This is where you come in... It's been a joy to watch as God has answered prayers about previous financial stresses and breaking down walls of pride over the last year. We know that we couldn't do this fight alone and we appreciate your gifts and encouragement to keep going. Thank You All The Fawley Family"

It is a miracle that our Mom found him right away and was able to call 9-1-1 and get him transported to the hospital immediately. This literally saved his life! He was in the ICU for the first 2 weeks as his blood pressure could not be regulated. He has responded very well and is currently at a physical therapy and rehabilitation facility where he’s working really hard and receiving intensive treatment on a daily basis. He has lost mobility and sensation on the left side of his body  but has already made tremendous strides toward recovery. However  this has all cost him his job where has worked for over 5 years. He no longer has health insurance after his job loss  and the costs of his recovery are astronomical! So we are turning to our friends  family  and compassionate caring people for help. Our family has always counted on both of parent’s income to make ends meet  pay the bills  and keep a roof over our heads. So against their prideful wishes  I’ve made this fundraising page and really hope that you all find it in your hearts to donate. Any amount will make a difference and will mean the world to us.In case you want to know a bit more about our Dad  here’s the scoop: Our Dad is the coolest guy ever  and we know many kids probably say that  but we really mean it. He is only 42 years old  and because he is the strongest man we’ve ever met  its extremely difficult to sit here and watch him suffer and stress over how he will get better and on top of that how he will pay for all our needs. He is the type of guy who is the first one to help any friend that is in need. We have seen him welcome and help out so many new Cuban families because he’s lived through their struggle and doesn’t want them to feel alone in the process of settling into a new country. Not only is he the most selfless  kind  and hard working man  but he’s always the one person we can look to for support  advice  and unconditional love. For once in our lives  we want to reverse the roles and take care of our Dad like he takes care of us and everyone else.Thank you for reading this and for any way that you can support us. We truly appreciate it and hope you can help in any way.Dani  Debbie  and Diego."

Mom and Cindy (donor) are both safely recovering at home. We also want to thank all of you for your abundant prayers  wishes  thoughts  encouragement  gifts  and support. We are so blessed to have such a strong community and supportive family. This has been amazing to witness! Us “Poetter” kids wanted to do something to help further support our mom and dad  which led us to start this fundraising page. We had previously discussed options with mom who graciously and humbly declined several times. However  a few days before surgery we were discussing the cost of surgery  the lost wages she will have  the travel expenses  her health insurance premiums and deductibles  and the money already spent last year in preparation for dialysis and the transplant. The numbers added up quickly and became overwhelming. Our parents have spent their whole lives giving to others in many ways without asking for anything in return. Now  us kids have decided to reach out and be their voice to ask for help. We ask that if you are compelled  please give what is right in your heart - every cent counts. Also consider sharing this link whether or not you are able to donate. We thank you all for supporting our parents through this challenging time. And keep the prayers coming for Mom and Cindy! Blessings to You All  The Poetter Family.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................Below is Ann's story in her own words:“Do I have an amazing story of the power of prayer and God’s grace! With my transplant surgery tomorrow (1/3/19) there have been many emotions the past few days but I am at peace. As I reflect on this whole kidney ride I am in awe of all the prayers that have gone up for me from all of you. God has answered all of them  some maybe not the way we wanted but by his grace most of them have been what we asked for or better.  When I was diagnosed in July of 2017  it was stage 4 acute kidney/ renal failure. We prayed for it to get better but by September it was stage 5/end stage chronic kidney failure. In His wisdom God had said no to that prayer. But then sent me on a journey!! He broke me down and began to teach me what trust is and where my trust should be. He opened my eyes to the grace He pours out to us every day through Jesus. He taught me the importance of prayer and opening up to the prayer Warriors He has put in my life. He put a selfless Christian woman in my life  my kidney sis. And then He never stopped loving me or letting me know He was there.  I am at peace today with whatever God does next with this surgery. How could I be anything else when He has gotten me over many hurdles? They said I would be a difficult match.  I would need dialysis for 1-5 years  most likely about 2 years and yet He found a match for me quickly. Last night was my last time on dialysis and that marks just under 3 months  not 2 years! Praise be to God! There are over 100 000 people waiting for a transplant  but only about 16 000 - 18 000/ year. I am blessed.  Then about 3 weeks before surgery I was told that my antibody number had gone up. This meant I would need to go through a desensitizing program. That is when they moved surgery from 1/2 to 1/3. I was going to have to do a series of things that come with risk and I was scared.  It would involve an IV of immune suppressing drugs that can cause some issues  then I would have had a line or port placed in my chest/ neck area. This would be used for 2 plasma treatments  the week of surgery. My blood would have been cycled out  plasma removed  antibodies hopefully reduced and plasma returned. Then the afternoon before surgery they would have checked my antibody level. If if wasn’t where they needed it to be the transplant would have been cancelled! More prayers by my faithful prayer warriors and God said  ”ok  I can change this”.   About a week later I got a call that my antibody number had dropped to lower than when we had first started the process. They asked a few questions about if I’d done certain things that month. I hadn’t so all they could say was that they had no idea how or why my numbers had dropped but they were cancelling the scary desensitizing program. Praise be to God! So does God hear our prayers  absolutely  so keep praying. Is it always a yes? No  but it is always for our best. God had a plan back in 1980 that would save my life in 2019. In 1980 while I was walking through the doors of Wisconsin Lutheran College as a student  Cindy was born. Little did I know the God would use WLC as my connection to my kidney sis. That is how we met years later when she was working there.  If God can do all of this  how can I be anything else but at peace. He knows what He’s doing! Continue to pray Warriors! God loves us. I love you all too. Thanks for hanging in there with us.” #annsplanted #donatelife #trustourgod"

Looking at that precious face  you wouldn’t know she is fighting big battles. On January 7th  Madelyn received a call from Wrenleigh’s pediatrician. Her newborn screen came back abnormal. He made arrangements for us at St. Louis Children’s Hospital to begin testing.  While there  she was seen by a team of residents  fellows  immunologists  rheumatologists  and cardiologists. Lab work  spinal tap  X-rays  echocardiograms  and genetic tests were done. Many of those were done in house and several were sent out to Mayo Clinic.  On day #10 we were able to come home with some information while final results were still a week away.  On January 23  at 23 days old  Wrenleigh was diagnosed with DiGeorge Syndrome  also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is when part of chromosome number 22 is missing  resulting in heart defects  cleft palate  learning and development problems  mental health problems  thymus gland disfunction  and autoimmune deficiencies. On January 29  Wrenleigh was admitted to St. Louis Children’s Hospital for heart failure. In addition to the 2 known heart defects (right aortic arch and large VSD)  the cardiologists discovered she has a rare anomaly called Hemitruncus. She will be having surgery to repair the VSD and Hemitruncus within the next two days.  Recovery time will be 2-4 weeks inpatient at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. THIS IS HER BIGGEST BATTLE YET! It is heartbreaking to see this beautiful baby of 7.5 pounds struggle to breathe  feed  and sleep.  There are many long days ahead for her. On Monday night (January 28) I prayed for God to put the doctors  nurses  and entire medical staff in place to take care of her. I felt we were in a place of uncertainty. As Madelyn and I walked into the ER of Children’s Hospital and the nurse took her into her arms and began to talk to us  I knew He had set His plan in motion. Our first request is prayer for Wrenleigh  family  and the medical staff. Madelyn will be staying with her following the surgery and during her recovery time at home. Her sick leave time is exhausted because of the pregnancy complications. Wrenleigh has private health insurance with a high deductible ($6500). Medical  travel  and out of pocket costs continue to grow. A big “thank you” to our SuperHeroes for your donations  prayers  and encouraging words.￼"

He now has hallucinations and frightening dreams which give him paranoid delusions. Medication is of limited help for him. It has been a very hard year for them.Carol was able to return to teaching with the new school year in August  but a urological condition became considerably worse  and soon she was placed on short-term disability. A urologist told her about a device that could be implanted like a pacemaker and would help her condition so that she would be able to work again. She had a trial period of using it externally  which was successful  and things began to look up.Unfortunately  her employer decided that they could no longer keep her position open.  Her health insurance goes away at the end of the month. She was able to schedule the surgery to permanently implant the device before the insurance ends  so a lot will be covered. However  she will still have to come up with over $900.00 in co-pays  plus additional doctor and anesthesiologist charges. She needs to be able to pay the co-pay by January 20th to go ahead with the surgery. The short-term disability will end on the 22nd  the same day as the surgery  leaving no time for follow-up appointments to evaluate how well the surgery worked. After that  she will have no income at all.  She is 62 and in poor health  so it may be hard for her to get a job. She might have to apply for a small Social Security check and an even smaller teacher pension if she can’t return to work. Being able to return to work is contingent on the success of the surgery. She is terrified about what she will do without any income before she can begin receiving some retirement or return to work.  The process will take weeks and perhaps months.  She doesn’t know what she will be able to do for health care either.  Her income situation is complicated  and she is doubtful she could qualify for state-provided health care or be able to afford something from the government marketplace.Meanwhile  her husband needs to be visited regularly to keep his spirits up. His disease is fatal  and she has no way of knowing how long he will live. She has been able to get to most appointments and fulfill obligations  which will be problematic when she runs out of gas money for her car.Carol feels terrible about asking for help  so I am asking on her behalf.  If you can help in her in any way  I know she would be so grateful.   She needs help with the copay for the surgery  and to cover utilities and living expenses for the next few months until she can work again or transition to retirement or disability."

She was in and out of the hospital for over a month trying to get treatment for what appears to be vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome  a life threatening condition that affects connective tissue. In order for Lacey to receive the treatment she needs  she first has to get a diagnosis.This is a time consuming and expensive process. Both neurosurgeons who treated Lacey in the hospital are concerned that she has vascular EDS  but because the condition is so rare testing is not covered by health insurance. EDS is a genetic disorder  and it runs in Lacey's family. We are fairly certain she has vascular EDS  but she needs to overcome the hurdle of diagnosis in order to continue with treatment.Lacey's neurosurgeon has referred her to a rheumatologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  but the expense of this visit is prohibitive for Lacey on her own.This medical emergency happened weeks after Lacey moved to Tallahassee  and she was in the process of getting covered by Medicaid at the time. Unfortunately  she did not have any health insurance when she had to go the ER. Lacey was not able to start her new job at TMH for over two months while she was in the hospital. She then incurred over $20 000 in medical expenses. She is in the probationary period in her new job and will eligible for insurance in six months.Even when she has insurance  Lacey will not able to afford this diagnostic process on her own. Here is a breakdown of expenses related to the diagnosis:$1000-$2000 for genetic testing$300 for a new patient appointment with the rheumatologist at the Mayo ClinicAdditionally  Lacey will have to pay for special diagnostic imaging (ex: a sit-down MRI)  a skin biopsy  and additional tests.Living with EDS means major arteries  muscles  or organs may dissect or rupture at any time. Lacey has already had three arterial dissections. They are very scary and very painful.Any amount you can contribute would be deeply appreciated and would put Lacey closer to getting the answers and the medical care she needs. She would use these funds primarily for her first visit to the Mayo Clinic.More info on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"

The next day she woke up in pain and had no feeling in her lower legs and feet. After 5 hrs of enduring this pain in post op  she was moved to another floor. Then it was a proactive nurse who listened to her complaints and cries and took action. She saved her life. After testing they discovered a blood clot the size of a golf ball in her Thoracic Artery outside her heart. Pieces broke off and traveled down her body causing Compartment Syndrome and damaging use of her feet. Amputation is still a possibility. They next performed 2 Fasciotomy surgeries on both sides of her legs. Due to the amount of blood clots  both were not a success. Removing the blood clot by her heart has a high risk factor. She was placed on blood thinners and being monitored daily to see if there is any change. Wound Vacs where placed inside her legs to help bring swelling down for closure. After 2 weeks of wound vacs closure was not a success due to the swelling. They then performed another surgery attaching Derma Closure devices. She still has no feeling in her feet. It's a day by day process waiting on wounds to reach the point for closure. Once released from hospital she will have to go directly to a Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Center to learn how to reuse her legs and feet before returning home. She will have to live with the golf ball sized blood clot hoping blood thinner will prevent something like this happening again. She tested positive for a P.F Gene This has been an uphill battle since day one. 5 surgeries in 3 weeks. Her physical therapy has been pushed back weeks due to delayed wound closures. The devices used on her recovery cause extreme daily pain. Life events always happen and no one is ever prepared for them. We definitely were taken back by this blow that struck both of us hard. Reality is also starting to set in. Gloria will be out of work for months maybe even more. Bills are already building up. We are reaching out to anyone who can assist us in our future trials.

But one thing about Carlos is how stubborn he is when it comes to accepting help - and that's where his friends and family come in.We learned today from Carlos that he is suffering from a retinal detachment  in one eye and after speaking with his vision specialist  he has to undergo surgery within 24 hours if there is any chance to save the vision in his eye.  The surgery is nothing short of a medical marvel  and a surgeon from Texas is flying to California to perform the surgery as I type this.  But Carlos needs our help.Due to Carlos' line of work as a body guard/security guard  his jobs are all contract-based and offer no benefits.  Carlos typically works two jobs putting in over 60 hours a week to be able to live in California close to his kids  and as I mentioned before  the last person he thinks of providing for is himself.  So we are hoping to raise the money for Carlos' surgery and recovery.  Any amount will help.  Please share this with anyone you feel may is inclined to help or share.  From Carlos  his friends and family - thank you."

Over the last ten years  keeping Kate out of the hospital has almost been a full time job. She suffers from an autoimmune disorder  and following a pancreatic transplant in 2017   she has suffered with open fistulas and bowel blockages that cause severe and constant pain. In 2018 alone  Kate was hospitalized 41 times  resulting in her being an inpatient more than she was at home. The medical bills for last year alone were crushing and she and her husband continue to manage those on a monthly basis.Last week her husband was laid off from his job with only a two week severance package. Unfortunately  that means that on March 31  2019 they will have no health insurance.  By God’s grace  Kate will qualify for Medicare through her disability later this summer.  In the meantime  they do have the option to COBRA with her husband’s current insurance  but the cost to do that is $2 348.00 per month. She has been working diligently on her nutrition levels so she can have yet another surgery to hopefully resolve some of her current issues. As you you can see  Kate cannot be without health insurance for even one day. Turning to family  friends  and acquaintances is not what she wants to do  but she has no other choice at this time.I appreciate you reading Kate’s story.

If you want to donate but would rather send a check to Donna and Ken  please email Donna at Donna.Pearson@patientpoint.com to get the mailing address. We thank you in advance  and God Bless!"

The pain in my head is becoming excruciating again. No surgery this time. They want to do focused radiation. 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Ugh. But at least it's not surgery. THAT was traumatic. But  there's an 80-90% chance the tumor will not grow back after the radiation  and I like those odds. There's a big co-pay with every visit  so 30 co-pays. A month-and-a-half ago  I woke up to some vision loss in my right eye. I've seen an ophthalmologist who has run some tests  determined it wasn't in my eyes  it's in my brain  it's not related to my brain tumor  and by the way  there's loss of peripheral vision in both eyes  too. Now I need to see a specialist-specialist - a neuro-ophthalmologist  who specializes in where the eyes communicate with the brain. Many expensive tests in my future. This is especially frustrating and upsetting because I'm WordPress web designer  a graphic designer  and a fine artist  and I've just started painting again since my brain surgery  and now I'm losing my vision. I need to see. I hope we can stop it. Then I found out that there is an excellent likelihood that I lose my health insurance as of January 1  2019. I'm working on that  too. The money raised will help me get all this taken care of. We're not sure what the symptoms will be when all this is done.

We will be in the hospital again for at least a week while they run many tests and hopefully start and immune system treatment. We will have another bone marrow biopsy in the near future as well. Thank you so much to those who have donated  kept her in your prayers  and sent cards. They brighten her spirit!Hello everyone. As many of you know  Kay has been pretty sick for the last few months. She went into the hospital right after Thanksgiving and stayed for 8 days. She ended up having to go back in on December 27th with severe dehydration. She has 3 autoimmune diseases affecting her liver  blood  heart  and blood sugars and unfortunately  they don’t always play nicely together. She started in ICU and slowly got better as doctors here in Bozeman tried to figure out what caused her decline. However  no matter how hard they tried  she was still struggling. So she was air lifted to Salt Lake where she unfortunately fell and fractured her hip  needing surgery. She has been working so hard in PT so that she can come home. We still have a long road ahead of us and many doctors here in Bozeman and a home health care team will monitor her here as we continue to try and make her better. Rick has been with her every step of the way! He has been an amazing support system for her. Putting his own rest  fears  and even a hurt shoulder on the back burner while he cares for her. He is truly remarkable ❤️They have developed many needs and payments over the course of the last 2 months. She has great health insurance  so thankfully  we don’t see very many medical costs coming from this  however the sudden transfer to Salt Lake has incurred many costs from travel  hotels  medical supplies  and of course  food. We have most of the gear and supplies she will need already  but we have need of a lift recliner upon her return home. Many of you have reached out to many of us asking how you can help. There are many different ways to help: We can always use prayers! We still have a long road ahead with many doctors appointments and many questions still yet to be answered.

He now has hallucinations and frightening dreams which give him paranoid delusions. Medication is of limited help for him. It has been a very hard year for them.Carol was able to return to teaching with the new school year in August  but a urological condition became considerably worse  and soon she was placed on short-term disability. A urologist told her about a device that could be implanted like a pacemaker and would help her condition so that she would be able to work again. She had a trial period of using it externally  which was successful  and things began to look up.Unfortunately  her employer decided that they could no longer keep her position open.  Her health insurance goes away at the end of the month. She was able to schedule the surgery to permanently implant the device before the insurance ends  so a lot will be covered. However  she will still have to come up with over $900.00 in co-pays  plus additional doctor and anesthesiologist charges. She needs to be able to pay the co-pay by January 20th to go ahead with the surgery. The short-term disability will end on the 22nd  the same day as the surgery  leaving no time for follow-up appointments to evaluate how well the surgery worked. After that  she will have no income at all.  She is 62 and in poor health  so it may be hard for her to get a job. She might have to apply for a small Social Security check and an even smaller teacher pension if she can’t return to work. Being able to return to work is contingent on the success of the surgery. She is terrified about what she will do without any income before she can begin receiving some retirement or return to work.  The process will take weeks and perhaps months.  She doesn’t know what she will be able to do for health care either.  Her income situation is complicated  and she is doubtful she could qualify for state-provided health care or be able to afford something from the government marketplace.Meanwhile  her husband needs to be visited regularly to keep his spirits up. His disease is fatal  and she has no way of knowing how long he will live. She has been able to get to most appointments and fulfill obligations  which will be problematic when she runs out of gas money for her car.Carol feels terrible about asking for help  so I am asking on her behalf.  If you can help in her in any way  I know she would be so grateful.   She needs help with the copay for the surgery  and to cover utilities and living expenses for the next few months until she can work again or transition to retirement or disability."

She was in and out of the hospital for over a month trying to get treatment for what appears to be vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome  a life threatening condition that affects connective tissue. In order for Lacey to receive the treatment she needs  she first has to get a diagnosis.This is a time consuming and expensive process. Both neurosurgeons who treated Lacey in the hospital are concerned that she has vascular EDS  but because the condition is so rare testing is not covered by health insurance. EDS is a genetic disorder  and it runs in Lacey's family. We are fairly certain she has vascular EDS  but she needs to overcome the hurdle of diagnosis in order to continue with treatment.Lacey's neurosurgeon has referred her to a rheumatologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  but the expense of this visit is prohibitive for Lacey on her own.This medical emergency happened weeks after Lacey moved to Tallahassee  and she was in the process of getting covered by Medicaid at the time. Unfortunately  she did not have any health insurance when she had to go the ER. Lacey was not able to start her new job at TMH for over two months while she was in the hospital. She then incurred over $20 000 in medical expenses. She is in the probationary period in her new job and will eligible for insurance in six months.Even when she has insurance  Lacey will not able to afford this diagnostic process on her own. Here is a breakdown of expenses related to the diagnosis:$1000-$2000 for genetic testing$300 for a new patient appointment with the rheumatologist at the Mayo ClinicAdditionally  Lacey will have to pay for special diagnostic imaging (ex: a sit-down MRI)  a skin biopsy  and additional tests.Living with EDS means major arteries  muscles  or organs may dissect or rupture at any time. Lacey has already had three arterial dissections. They are very scary and very painful.Any amount you can contribute would be deeply appreciated and would put Lacey closer to getting the answers and the medical care she needs. She would use these funds primarily for her first visit to the Mayo Clinic.More info on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"

The next day she woke up in pain and had no feeling in her lower legs and feet. After 5 hrs of enduring this pain in post op  she was moved to another floor. Then it was a proactive nurse who listened to her complaints and cries and took action. She saved her life. After testing they discovered a blood clot the size of a golf ball in her Thoracic Artery outside her heart. Pieces broke off and traveled down her body causing Compartment Syndrome and damaging use of her feet. Amputation is still a possibility. They next performed 2 Fasciotomy surgeries on both sides of her legs. Due to the amount of blood clots  both were not a success. Removing the blood clot by her heart has a high risk factor. She was placed on blood thinners and being monitored daily to see if there is any change. Wound Vacs where placed inside her legs to help bring swelling down for closure. After 2 weeks of wound vacs closure was not a success due to the swelling. They then performed another surgery attaching Derma Closure devices. She still has no feeling in her feet. It's a day by day process waiting on wounds to reach the point for closure. Once released from hospital she will have to go directly to a Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Center to learn how to reuse her legs and feet before returning home. She will have to live with the golf ball sized blood clot hoping blood thinner will prevent something like this happening again. She tested positive for a P.F Gene This has been an uphill battle since day one. 5 surgeries in 3 weeks. Her physical therapy has been pushed back weeks due to delayed wound closures. The devices used on her recovery cause extreme daily pain. Life events always happen and no one is ever prepared for them. We definitely were taken back by this blow that struck both of us hard. Reality is also starting to set in. Gloria will be out of work for months maybe even more. Bills are already building up. We are reaching out to anyone who can assist us in our future trials. We are asking for any financial help to keep her health insurance going  Medical bills  Home bills  Medical equipment  Rehab  Adapting our home for her physical needs  transportation etc. Shes fighting hard.

If you want to donate but would rather send a check to Donna and Ken  please email Donna at Donna.Pearson@patientpoint.com to get the mailing address. We thank you in advance  and God Bless!"

Her hope is to work as much as possible to keep her mind busy  still see all of her wonderful co-workers/ clients and provide financially for her family. Marie’s main goal is to be strong and ready for baseball season  she has never missed one of her children’s baseball games and she is looking forward to spending all her spare time at the ball field!! Marie has had a ton of love and support already from friends  family  and co-workers and is truly grateful for everyone’s support in her fight! Marie will try to keep everyone updated on her progress  likely through social media. Marie has been my best friend since third grade and the closest thing I have ever had to a sister.

"Medical","February 15, 2019","Claire&apos;s Mental Health Success Fund","$5,115","$5,000","50","2","53","217","MARTINEZ","CA","Last year we had a painful awakening. After a severe bullying situation that was a friend breakup gone wrong our straight A athletic student started to spiral. Her grades went down and she stopped going to track. She started to close herself off emotionally. Our daughter is/was clinically depressed  suicidal and anxious. Not knowing what else to do and on the advice of her pediatrician we  sent her to the John Muir Adolescent Mental Health Outpatient program to stabilize her. That was the start of multiple hospitalizations  intensive therapy for her and a lot of work on ourselves so that we could change patterns that contributed to her mental state. Last year she went to a residential program in Orange  CA and then came home to another intensive outpatient therapy program. She then stabilized in her school using resources made available to her by the school district  her therapist and psychiatrist. We thought we were further down the road to recovery than we are. It's easy let your guard down. I thought I could start growing my business again and that life would go back to normal.  The whole cycle restarted last week. She voluntarily hospitalized herself and she's back in outpatient with a possibility of residential care again. She is on the waitlist for the UCSF DBT program—only 1 of two bay area  intensive evidence-based DBT programs that takes insurance  and 4 in the state— it's a  6 month wait because the need is so great. It is the therapy that time and again is recommended by our mental healthcare team.  It involves weekly 1x1 therapy  group education and 24x7 coaching on mindfulness techniques. I am the primary caregiver but here's the problem; I'm self-employed so I can't go on paid family leave. There is no safety net for our family.  Here's what it's like to care for a mentally ill kid:Volatility: Any emotional setback can quickly spiral to suicidal thoughts. That means if we say the wrong thing she could wind up in the hospital. Some days she is completely fine.  Somewhere in the middle there's this:  my daughter may be overwhelmed and needs to leave school in the middle of the day.  She can't be left alone after that. Self-harm: You could  wake up to a daughter who has cut her wrists to deal with her intense emotional pain. It's the scariest thing ever. That was last week for us.Social interactions with peers are needed and yet problematic. You have to stay on top of social situations and monitor for substance abuse: For my daughter: After years of not finding her friend group and being subjected to bullying in Junior High she has lots of friends at her high school but the pressures of social media and to be noticed has contributed to her emotional spiral. She wants to be like everyone else but she isn’t like everyone else. Part of fitting in is smoking weed and drinking.  A friend who thinks they’re doing her a solid by helping her numb her pain with a hit on the wax pen is contributing to her crash. Teens on medication who have depression issues especially need to stay away from drugs and alcohol. Her interactions with peers must be closely monitored. Your life can change in an instant.Your child goes from pretty self sufficient to needing round the clock care from moment to moment.  You can’t work a 9-5 job. You need to be there. As her primary caregiver You are the driver  You are the personal assistant  the pharmacist   the researcher  the interviewer/interviewee  the canary in the coal mine  the insurance fighter   the emotional punching bag  the unwavering support  her “person”. You don't usually have a solid block of time in your day for much else other than to fall apart when everyone else is asleep.You have to work on yourself too: Speaking of falling apart some of this is the result of a pattern in our family and our family histories  that we need to break. That requires much self-reflection for both myself and my husband. We both have unresolved issues from our own childhoods that are now front and center. It also affects our current relationships and boundary-setting within our own families to protect our family. This is devastating in and of itself when you have family members who also have unresolved mental health issues that affect your immediate family and children. Sometimes it's not just your immediate family that falls apart. You can't forget about their siblings. We have  another daughter who isn’t mentally ill and she can’t be left behind. She needs care too. Her sister is not the same girl she grew up with and she misses her and the time when our life was stable. She doesn't understand why her sister wants to die sometimes.The financial impact of mental illness on a family is catastrophic. Losing income causes a stressful family environment. We’ve lost about half my income and one month before the breakdown I signed a 2-year lease on a photo studio that has largely sat empty (hindsight is 20/20 ) Health insurance is around $2000 a month but that doesn’t cover our maximum out of pocket. Insurance is about to turn over for us in April and the obligation to pay a max out of pocket will reset. We are in that gray area where we make too much money to qualify for public assistance and too little to pay the premiums  deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions combined. I need to take time to care for my daughter . While being worried about her my husband and I are  feeling so much anxiety about how we'll make ends meet. It's not good for her to be around stressed out parents.Other ways to help:  Recommend me:  I don’t have the time  the  means to market my business or the mental energy to network. I'm  taking word of mouth clients and recommendations because my marketing department has been on hiatus.  If you can't contribute please recommend me to friends and family who might need a wedding  portrait or headshot photographer.  I shoot  while my husband is home from work and I am committed to my craft and clients despite hardship.Meals: we won't say no to a meal dropped off.A shoulder. That's always nice. Help mental health awareness in your community.  Build community. Reserve judgement.  Understand that with the right treatment a person can be a fully functioning healthy member of society. Understand that mental illness impacts the whole family  that no one person caused it. Understand that a person who is actively seeking treatment is building skills that most people don't have.  I truly believe that going through fire  forges strength but it  takes the help of your community to make your way through it. It's humbling and scary to tell this story and ask for help so please give us grace as we heal. Do what you can to reverse the stigma in mental health. Educate yourself.  Reach out to me. I will be the shoulder that understands. Read this blog post and do one thing on this list:  25 Ways You Can Impact Mental Health Awareness in Your Community"

After waking up  thinking the procedure had went as planned  she got the worst news anyone could receive. She had to be told that the surgery actually never took place. They had to stop the surgery before anything was removed. When the first incisions were made to her abdomen  fluid came gushing out. This was the first sign Jo had ovarian cancer. The tumor was in the way and the doctors could not go any further. The plan is to remove the fluid with several rounds of chemotherapy and then surgery to remove the cancer. After that will be several rounds of chemotherapy again. Funds that are raised will help offset all the gaps that are in their health insurance coverage. There will be huge amounts of deductibles and co-pays which will financially  burden this wonderful family. Not only those costs but the cost of lost wages and time away from work for her loving Husband that is the sole provider for the family of 5. Raising a family of five is hard  having to deal with Cancer and the financial devastation that comes with seems unbearable. The time is now. We respectfully ask you to donate and be Urgent.

There was no definitive explanation as to why these issues have come about but I have been labeled with peripheral neuropathy  CRPS  migraines  anisocoria  essential tremors  light and sound sensitivity  unexplained nausea  and tinnitus over the past 12 years. There were no abnormalities or explanations on tests with the exception of an enlarged and complex pineal gland.In 2016  I found a facebook group called Pineal Cysts and Tumors that has not only supported me emotionally  but also provided me with valuable information that linked me with doctors educated in my specific illness. Other members in this group had similar symptoms as mine and I was amazed that most doctors had very little knowledge of the pineal gland. In September  I became ill with hives and received what should have been a simple and easy treatment. I then became violently ill and felt myself take a turn for the worse. I have not been able to work or petsit since the beginning of September. Standing is unbearable after 15 minutes. Sensitivity to light and noise noticed. When people speak in a regular voice I think they are shouting. I can’t stand fluorescent lights. Stress seems to aggravate everything at this point. I noticed recently I get angry easily and am more impatient from when I last thought I was becoming impatient.  I am easily lost in the middle of a sentence and I will pause until I can regain my train of thought. (Thanks everyone for finishing my sentences and reminding me what we were talking about!) I get nausea randomly  or if their is an unexpected texture when eating. Debilitating migraines! Recently  I experienced my first aural migraine. My social  home and work life have suffered dramatically over the past 6 months. Lately I feel so tired; sleeping in a dark quiet room has become my life. I feel my quality of life has declined for so many years  but this year has been nearly unbearable. I don’t think there any other options at this point.  After feeling as if I did my \"due diligence\"  I reached out to Dr. Sunil J. Patel in Charleston  SC after reading that he is one of the 5 doctors in the WORLD that regularly deal with the pineal gland. I sent my MRIs  CT scans  medical records and a list/timeline of my symptoms to Dr. Patel and was told \" I can cure you\" on November 16th 2018. My surgery is scheduled December 19th  2018 in Charleston SC.  https://www.broadcastmed.com/neurology/7419/videos/resection-of-pineocytomas-offers-symptom-relief Moving forward and costsI am expected to make a full recovery and should be able to return to work March 2019. This is where you come in  as you can imagine  my medical journey has become quite expensive. I have luckily been able to obtain COBRA continuation health insurance through my job which brings my $113 000.00 brain surgery to around $6 000.00 to $10 000.00. I have also cashed out my 401k and have been living off this money. Unfortunately  I am reaching the end of my funds and feel I have gotten so close to the end of this nightmare. I need help  your help to keep this journey going!Your donation will go towards basic living expenses and medical bills. I know you all can't wait to get me back. Help me get over this horrifying illness!"

They spearheaded the opening of the LGBT resource center at Northwestern University back in 2004  and found great joy connecting young people to resources and being a friendly mentor. Jonny (Jenn) is a founding member of Up North Pride  an organization that has built one of the largest Pride events in Michigan in just 6 years. Their love  patience  and warmth is felt by everyone around them. Our community is a stronger  brighter place with them in it. We are all deserving of care. We live in a world that often falls short from meeting our basic needs. Gender confirmation is necessary medical care. For many  it is life and death.This Friday  (3/8/19) Jonny will undergo a bilateral mastectomy aka chest reconstruction aka gender confirmation surgery in Ann Arbor. They are grateful to find the care they need  but it requires travel downstate  and a week-long stay at the hospital-hotel. The recovery time is up to 6 weeks  during which Jonny will be unable to lift more than a few pounds  drive or work. Elon will be out of work and with Jonny as primary caretaker during this time. After that  we will rely on friends/family to make sure that Jonny is fed  watered and looked after. Back in 2017  Jonny and Elon started paying ungodly monthly premiums for a health insurance policy that was more likely than most to cover the procedure. Twenty months later  they will finally have this transformative procedure. Insurance will partially cover the cost of surgery  but the out of pocket costs including travel  hotel  and Jonny out of work will be upwards of $8500. Until healthcare is accessible to all  let us join together to stand by our values  and to show our love and support to Jonny. Donated funds will go directly to paying the out of pocket/out of work costs for Jonny to heal and recover.Please join me in the opportunity to support this dear human as they embark on this next phase of their life.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a type of lung disease that results in scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs for an unknown reason. Over time  the scarring gets worse and it becomes hard to take in a deep breath and the lungs cannot take in enough oxygen. There is no cure currently to this disease and only treatments that will help slow the process. We have currently exhausted those treatments and the only option left is a lung transplant. My dad is the kindest and most hard working man I have ever known who did his absolute best in providing a roof over my head and meals on the table while growing up.  We didn't have much but we always had what we needed and for that I grew up learning the value of a dollar. I will forever be grateful for him and every thing he has done for me and I am hoping to return the favor.  As of this week  my dad has had to stop working which means that he will no longer have health insurance or means to pay his bills. In order to do the transplant  we need $10 000 initially as like a down payment which we don't have. I don't expect this to bring in much so I will be taking out a personal loan for the cost because  well  I refuse to let my dad die without trying.  Any help is greatly appreciated  even if it's $1.Also  if you can't help  don't feel bad! Just buy my dad a drink next time you see him and we will be just as appreciative because life's too short and he should still enjoy whatever time he may have left."

Our father was diagnosed with lung cancer. It started with some back pain that eventually worsened and lead to the doctor who suggested he get an MRI on his back and neck. The results came back and it showed a mass next to his spine on the nerve sheath about 2x1.5cm in size. We did not know at that time if it was cancerous or not. Dad went to a few doctors but ended up back in the emergency room every week. Finally  the last visit on October 27  they did a full MRI and CT scan and that is when they found the mass on his lung  in his liver  and tumors all down his spine. We are devastated. We are at an absolute loss for words but we are hopeful. We are strong because he is strong.      Dad has worked in masonry his whole life  since he was a child  no joke. He has done brick  block  stone  tile  concrete  shotcrete  you name it and he has done it and not only has he done it but he is damn good at it and the best that I have ever seen. He is not one who pains easily. He is the toughest and strongest man I know so when he told us and we saw how much pain he was in  we didn't take it lightly. Dad has worked his rear off his entire life to keep a roof over our heads  food in our bellies  and clothes on our backs. He has given his last dollar to someone in more need of it than him. He would give you the coat and shirt off of his back during a blizzard  because that is my father. He taught us to care for others  nature  and most importantly family and ourselves. This man isn't just our father  he is our best friend and that is why we need your help so badly.      We have an appointment with the oncologist Thursday  November 1  for a consultation. I am hoping they will be able to do something quickly about the tumor that is pressing against his spine which is causing him the most pain. He cannot use his right arm much at this point and has been without sleep for weeks. He is able to sleep but its only for a few hours here and there on and off. We know he is going to need surgery and probably chemo or radiation  we are not 100% positive at what all we are looking at until we do the consult Thursday. But  what we do know  is he is already drowning in debt because of this. Dad was in the middle of getting his company started and up off the ground so he is in between health insurance right now. He is already over $5 000 in debt just from the MRI's and emergency room visits  not to mention the orthopedic surgeon they sent him to before they knew what the situation was and the other doctors he has visited in-between. We need all the help we can get to help him stay as stress free as possible during this whole situation. If we cannot get health insurance for him or financial assistance  because they are very limited in funding  we are terrified that he will be so stressed from the amount of debt that he puts himself into that he won't have the spirit to stay positive and keep a positive outlook which could diminish his outlook on the whole situation. I know he would never give up  that is not in his soul. But  there is only so much one man can take. Please  share this  donate  spread the word. This man has given people a place to call home when they had no home of their own. He has given people food to eat when they had nothing to eat or anyway of paying for food. He is not a saint  believe me  but he is the greatest man I have ever met and he is our best friend and our father. We cannot let him leave this Earth before he sees his grand-babies grow up. We thank you from the very depths of our hearts. We are staying positive and hopeful and expect him to pull through this but we can't do it alone."

Most of these (primarily alternative) are  unfortunately  not covered by health insurance and I do not have the financial resources to pay for them out of pocket. These include ozone therapy  IV therapy  hyperbaric oxygen chamber and infrared saunas  colonics  nutritional supplements and vitamins  hormone and blood testing  psychological therapies  energy healing  and the list goes on. In total  approximately one month of treatment alone costs $5 000. Additionally  standard tests like a PET scan have been rejected by insurance  and if I pursue surgery  it will personally cost me $7 500. I understand there may be deep fears  concerns  and skepticism around the effectiveness of some of my treatments and medical choices. Please trust that I have made these decisions only after extensive research and many inspirational discussions with survivors. I hope to some day pass down my own story and learnings to help other women in similar situations. You will be contributing to me  as well as the circle and betterment of women everywhere. My mission is to not only heal myself and continue helping others as I've done my whole life  but also be a part of a growing movement dedicated to medical innovation through nature  studies on the emotional and environmental effects of our health  and most importantly  the possibility of miracles. Many of you already wrap me up in your friendship  comfort  and thoughts. For this  I am eternally grateful.

Since that time  we've been through a lot. A lot of tears  frustration  agony  and hope that Dad will get back to living a normal life someday. Most days  Dad is confined to his wheelchair and/or his bed  which is all in the same living room of his home. Someone has to move him back and forth every day  feed him  change his clothes  etc. So  while living a normal life again doesn't seem possible at the moment  we are striving for him to at least gain as much of his body as he can  or at least see if it's a possibility. Dad has health insurance  which will pay for physical therapy for him to work on his arm/leg movement. However  he can't get back to physical therapy until doctors say he is making enough improvement with his current treatment  which is not covered by health insurance. He's been doing a program called ABLE  Activity-Based Locomotor Exercise program for the past couple months and they say he's really gaining a lot strength. They basically say we need to keep going with the program for 3 more months and see if he can improve enough to get put back into physical therapy - basically go big or go home for 3 months and see what happens. He has run through a lot of money/assets and is asking for help. I sometimes don't like gofundme pages  because I feel like a lot of them could be avoided if they simply had insurance in place. However  there are times for them and I believe this is one of them. His next 3 months will help determine a lot for the rest of his life and I'd like to help as much as I can. The cost of the ABLE program for this next time is going to be $4 600. If you feel like you're in a position to help even a little  he would really appreciate it. If not  please send positive energy his way if you don't mind...he needs everything at this point.

She brought my child into this world with just a half-cell’s contribution from me  struggling as her body dealt with an alien invasion that turned into the delightful child we plaster all over your screens.And her brain is a little bit broken. A frequent sufferer of migraines that required dozens of Botox injections prior to the pregnancy  my Nellky has cerebral blood flow a little bit different from you and I. We found out just how different a week ago.The first emergency room visit was for a classic migraine. For her  those mean four rounds of opiates to reduce the massive pain and give the brain enough space to try and resolve itself. It got worse just three days later.Nell complained of a thunderclap headache that was nothing like her nearly decade-long migraine history. The ER doc thought stroke. The tele-neurologist thought stroke. With varying degrees of sensation throughout her extremities  we were on board. They just couldn’t confirm it without an MRI scan. At a regional healthcare facility  that would take until morning. We got to the ER at 8 PM. You can only detect a mild stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within two hours of the event.Things went from bad to worse. Her pain wasn’t managed. She wasn’t seen by doctors for hours at a time. We had to fight with the medical director who threatened to kick us out of the hospital because we were pleading with him to find some way to manage her pain. It had been 36 hours at a 10 out of 10 scale. Unable to see  she nevertheless found a cousin at a hospital an hour away who fast-tracked her through their ER.The treatment plan there was simple: quiet  pain meds  peace. Nell and I both slept for the first time in 36 hours. It had been just five days since this ordeal started. There was  and is  just one issue: ongoing condition management.We moved down south from our home in New Jersey a few weeks ago. We’re 100 percent sure that the stress of that and our limited finances (we’re both at least two months behind on credit cards and old utilities) led to this stroke. Unfortunately  we also hadn’t had a chance to update our health insurance. Who does? Within a week of moving in with a two-year-old kiddo and a 14-year-old dog?So  three emergency room bills we haven’t seen yet. They usually cost a bit under $2 000. Two months of back bills at about $4 000. So  ideally we could raise $6 000-$10 000 and feel slightly less like bankruptcy is our best bet. Right now  we're shooting for less than half of that because we know that everyone is facing their own struggles. Christmas is coming  but it feels more like the chained ghost of Scrooge. I don’t even wear hats anymore  but I have a hat in my hand. If money is the root of most stress  it’s easy to see why we’re looking for some friends here. It’s the only way I know to keep my wife as healthy as she can be. Any bit you can manage would help."

We are Laurel and Peter Cabrera and for the past year our world  in some ways  was turned upside down as we grappled with the idea of being infertile. In a lot of ways this word does not feel right for us  two healthy individuals with all the right ingredients  yet the reality of naturally getting pregnant the old fashioned way is not in the cards for us. IVF for pregnancy is our only hope!Let us explain.... After moving to Oregon in late 2015 to be closer to family and settle our roots on the West coast  we knew it was finally the right time to really try to get pregnant. We assumed early on that it wasn't happening quickly do to the busyness of life and being in a transitional phase. But after a year or so had gone by with Laurel having regular health visits  acupuncture  and screenings that deemed everything healthy we knew something else was off. Our diligence in trying began to take its emotional toll  and it was time that Peter was screened to see if there were any contributing factors. And this is when the story shifts. Right before Christmas last year we got the news that there was NO sperm and we were in shock. This is not the outcome that we were prepared for! Seeing as these were rare results and did not make sense  we knew it was time to get serious and to consult a fertility professional. This is when he informed us that Peter needed genetic testing and that it was possible he was born without the vas deferens which carries out the sperm. Through genetic testing we found out more shocking news that Peter is a carrier for Cystic Fibrosis which is a direct link to being born without the vas deferens. We made an appointment with a specialty Urologist to confirm all of the results and our path was forever changed due to this news. IVF would be our only option of pregnancy now  but we would have to wait until September of 2018 for Peter’s TESE procedure to confirm that there was sperm and we are so thankful that there is!!During this time Laurel also got genetic testing to make sure she is not a carrier for Cystic Fibrosis and thankfully is not. It takes two carriers to have a child with the condition  and although that was a shocking discovery we are grateful that we can pursue having children knowing we won’t pass it on. All of this news was extremely heavy to take on. We had to mourn the fact that we will never be able to have a child the traditional way  and that our only means for pregnancy is medically intense and expensive. We bought our first home in 2017 dreaming about starting our family there  but never imagining the even bigger financial burden that we would have to take on. While grief has made its way in our journey we are also extremely grateful to be healthy individuals that have confirmation now  right before celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary in October  that we can pursue IVF with hopefully great results. Our hope now is that the financial burden of it all could be lessened and we are also hopeful and grateful for any support that may come our way. Your love and generosity mean more than you can imagine. And we will take all the prayers we can get as we continue on this journey of starting our family.The Cost:Appointments  tests  and consultations are very expensive and not covered at all by health insurance! We are currently $3 000 deep for genetic testing  misc. appointments  and TESE procedure.IVF = $15 000This includes all appointments  medication/injections  and egg retrieval.:::We are very humbled to be in this position and to ask for help. While we stayed pretty private about this journey this year  it is our hope that sharing with loved ones will bring encouragement and that we may be surrounded in prayer. God has taken us on quite the journey this year  and we will continue to lean into Him and persevere as we prepare for IVF in late November. We appreciate your sensitivity in reading this and give many thanks in advance for your prayers and support!Love The Cabrera's"

My dear friend Bianca Gaspar is facing a hugely difficult health challenge at the moment. She was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Kidney Disease. Unfortunately  her health insurance isn’t covering the cost for a biopsy to understand where her treatment can begin  let alone her treatment costs. Now that Bianca has received support to afford her biopsy thanks to you all  let's support her so that when her treatment plan is determined next week she will be able to move forward with her doctor's recommendations. Bianca is one of the strongest  most giving people I know. She loves deeply and without fear and deserves the same in return from her community  in the form of us supporting her health and her ability to pursue her dreams.She is the most loving aunt to her niece and nephew and a complete joy to all of her family and friends  the sweetest dog mommy  and an overall amazing  fun-loving person. She has been dealing with debilitating fatigue in recent months due to her diagnosis and hasn’t felt like herself. She is headed back to school in January to continue on her journey to become a Child Psychologist. Please support her in her healing journey  so that she can focus on being the student  daughter  sister  friend  partner  and loving healer she is dedicated to be. Bianca’s father passed away from the same disease Bianca is currently facing when she was 16. The doctors at the time said it was most likely not genetic  so Bianca’s recent diagnosis came as a huge surprise. Bianca braved the loss of her father  among other hardships  with strength and resilience  just as she is facing her current circumstances. Now that she has her diagnosis  she is dedicated to facing whatever results she is given and to move forward with treatments that will allow her to live fully.Once a diagnosis is determined  treatment can help slow the progression of kidney disease and when necessary  kidney transplants are available. Thanks to you all  Bianca has her biopsy scheduled for the upcoming week! Through this  her underlying cause will be understood and her doctors will be able to determine her treatment plan as soon as possible. Bianca is attempting to enroll in a health insurance plan outside of her Indian Health Service plan so that her treatment plan will be covered. Bianca deserves to be able to get more than just her biopsy  so let's support her in receiving whatever treatment is recommended for her. There are many costs facing her in this journey and this campaign won't cover all of them but let's help her get started. Please help Bianca as she faces something that no 26-year-old should have to face.

Her type of cancer is considered a rare and aggressive form  so her team of doctors immediately started her on a simultaneous treatment of chemotherapy & radiation for the next 8-12 weeks or more. This is a very harsh treatment as she will be getting a few rounds of 2 different types of chemotherapy. It will be a long road ahead of healing and recovery. She has already begun feeling chemo fatigue  weight loss  hair loss  and intense mix of emotions. Andrea is hopeful though! She has faith in her doctors and in her conventional therapy  but she also knows that complementary alternative therapies are instrumental in the healing process. Therefore  she is now seeking natural  alternative modalities such as body work (massage)  regular acupuncture treatments  much needed herbs/supplements and guidance from a Certified Naturopathic Doctor that will complement her conventional cancer treatment in a safe & knowledgeable way. Alternative therapies can help Andrea feel more at ease  relieve her symptoms from chemo and radiation and give her the healing she deserves. Unfortunately  obtaining this complementary  alternative therapy is not cheap and is not covered by her health insurance.She was working full time  but is now on disability indefinitely until she gets better. As we all know  state disability is barely enough to pay for her food  gas  bills and home. Please help me raise funds to help Andrea obtain the alternative healing she needs to get through this. My sister is a beautiful  fun  happy and kind person who has always helped many before herself. It’s her time to receive all the love at this time. I will post updates as often as possible. I am happy to answer any questions about her journey  treatments and use of funds. Thank you for reading! Any amount is appreciated! My family & I are grateful to you all!"

I gotten medi-vac two days later to Oahu admitted into Kaiser Moanalua where I’m waiting for a triple bypass. Doctors doing extensive testing and found three main arteries are shutting down.

Our father was diagnosed with lung cancer. It started with some back pain that eventually worsened and lead to the doctor who suggested he get an MRI on his back and neck. The results came back and it showed a mass next to his spine on the nerve sheath about 2x1.5cm in size. We did not know at that time if it was cancerous or not. Dad went to a few doctors but ended up back in the emergency room every week. Finally  the last visit on October 27  they did a full MRI and CT scan and that is when they found the mass on his lung  in his liver  and tumors all down his spine. We are devastated. We are at an absolute loss for words but we are hopeful. We are strong because he is strong.      Dad has worked in masonry his whole life  since he was a child  no joke. He has done brick  block  stone  tile  concrete  shotcrete  you name it and he has done it and not only has he done it but he is damn good at it and the best that I have ever seen. He is not one who pains easily. He is the toughest and strongest man I know so when he told us and we saw how much pain he was in  we didn't take it lightly. Dad has worked his rear off his entire life to keep a roof over our heads  food in our bellies  and clothes on our backs. He has given his last dollar to someone in more need of it than him. He would give you the coat and shirt off of his back during a blizzard  because that is my father. He taught us to care for others  nature  and most importantly family and ourselves. This man isn't just our father  he is our best friend and that is why we need your help so badly.      We have an appointment with the oncologist Thursday  November 1  for a consultation. I am hoping they will be able to do something quickly about the tumor that is pressing against his spine which is causing him the most pain. He cannot use his right arm much at this point and has been without sleep for weeks. He is able to sleep but its only for a few hours here and there on and off. We know he is going to need surgery and probably chemo or radiation  we are not 100% positive at what all we are looking at until we do the consult Thursday. But  what we do know  is he is already drowning in debt because of this. Dad was in the middle of getting his company started and up off the ground so he is in between health insurance right now. He is already over $5 000 in debt just from the MRI's and emergency room visits  not to mention the orthopedic surgeon they sent him to before they knew what the situation was and the other doctors he has visited in-between. We need all the help we can get to help him stay as stress free as possible during this whole situation. If we cannot get health insurance for him or financial assistance  because they are very limited in funding  we are terrified that he will be so stressed from the amount of debt that he puts himself into that he won't have the spirit to stay positive and keep a positive outlook which could diminish his outlook on the whole situation. I know he would never give up  that is not in his soul. But  there is only so much one man can take. Please  share this  donate  spread the word. This man has given people a place to call home when they had no home of their own. He has given people food to eat when they had nothing to eat or anyway of paying for food. He is not a saint  believe me  but he is the greatest man I have ever met and he is our best friend and our father. We cannot let him leave this Earth before he sees his grand-babies grow up. We thank you from the very depths of our hearts. We are staying positive and hopeful and expect him to pull through this but we can't do it alone."

Most of these (primarily alternative) are  unfortunately  not covered by health insurance and I do not have the financial resources to pay for them out of pocket. These include ozone therapy  IV therapy  hyperbaric oxygen chamber and infrared saunas  colonics  nutritional supplements and vitamins  hormone and blood testing  psychological therapies  energy healing  and the list goes on. In total  approximately one month of treatment alone costs $5 000. Additionally  standard tests like a PET scan have been rejected by insurance  and if I pursue surgery  it will personally cost me $7 500. I understand there may be deep fears  concerns  and skepticism around the effectiveness of some of my treatments and medical choices. Please trust that I have made these decisions only after extensive research and many inspirational discussions with survivors. I hope to some day pass down my own story and learnings to help other women in similar situations. You will be contributing to me  as well as the circle and betterment of women everywhere. My mission is to not only heal myself and continue helping others as I've done my whole life  but also be a part of a growing movement dedicated to medical innovation through nature  studies on the emotional and environmental effects of our health  and most importantly  the possibility of miracles. Many of you already wrap me up in your friendship  comfort  and thoughts. For this  I am eternally grateful.

Since that time  we've been through a lot. A lot of tears  frustration  agony  and hope that Dad will get back to living a normal life someday. Most days  Dad is confined to his wheelchair and/or his bed  which is all in the same living room of his home. Someone has to move him back and forth every day  feed him  change his clothes  etc. So  while living a normal life again doesn't seem possible at the moment  we are striving for him to at least gain as much of his body as he can  or at least see if it's a possibility. Dad has health insurance  which will pay for physical therapy for him to work on his arm/leg movement. However  he can't get back to physical therapy until doctors say he is making enough improvement with his current treatment  which is not covered by health insurance. He's been doing a program called ABLE  Activity-Based Locomotor Exercise program for the past couple months and they say he's really gaining a lot strength. They basically say we need to keep going with the program for 3 more months and see if he can improve enough to get put back into physical therapy - basically go big or go home for 3 months and see what happens. He has run through a lot of money/assets and is asking for help. I sometimes don't like gofundme pages  because I feel like a lot of them could be avoided if they simply had insurance in place. However  there are times for them and I believe this is one of them. His next 3 months will help determine a lot for the rest of his life and I'd like to help as much as I can. The cost of the ABLE program for this next time is going to be $4 600. If you feel like you're in a position to help even a little  he would really appreciate it. If not  please send positive energy his way if you don't mind...he needs everything at this point. Thanks so much!!"

She brought my child into this world with just a half-cell’s contribution from me  struggling as her body dealt with an alien invasion that turned into the delightful child we plaster all over your screens.And her brain is a little bit broken. A frequent sufferer of migraines that required dozens of Botox injections prior to the pregnancy  my Nellky has cerebral blood flow a little bit different from you and I. We found out just how different a week ago.The first emergency room visit was for a classic migraine. For her  those mean four rounds of opiates to reduce the massive pain and give the brain enough space to try and resolve itself. It got worse just three days later.Nell complained of a thunderclap headache that was nothing like her nearly decade-long migraine history. The ER doc thought stroke. The tele-neurologist thought stroke. With varying degrees of sensation throughout her extremities  we were on board. They just couldn’t confirm it without an MRI scan. At a regional healthcare facility  that would take until morning. We got to the ER at 8 PM. You can only detect a mild stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within two hours of the event.Things went from bad to worse. Her pain wasn’t managed. She wasn’t seen by doctors for hours at a time. We had to fight with the medical director who threatened to kick us out of the hospital because we were pleading with him to find some way to manage her pain. It had been 36 hours at a 10 out of 10 scale. Unable to see  she nevertheless found a cousin at a hospital an hour away who fast-tracked her through their ER.The treatment plan there was simple: quiet  pain meds  peace. Nell and I both slept for the first time in 36 hours. It had been just five days since this ordeal started. There was  and is  just one issue: ongoing condition management.We moved down south from our home in New Jersey a few weeks ago. We’re 100 percent sure that the stress of that and our limited finances (we’re both at least two months behind on credit cards and old utilities) led to this stroke. Unfortunately  we also hadn’t had a chance to update our health insurance. Who does? Within a week of moving in with a two-year-old kiddo and a 14-year-old dog?So  three emergency room bills we haven’t seen yet. They usually cost a bit under $2 000. Two months of back bills at about $4 000. So  ideally we could raise $6 000-$10 000 and feel slightly less like bankruptcy is our best bet. Right now  we're shooting for less than half of that because we know that everyone is facing their own struggles. Christmas is coming  but it feels more like the chained ghost of Scrooge. I don’t even wear hats anymore  but I have a hat in my hand. If money is the root of most stress  it’s easy to see why we’re looking for some friends here. It’s the only way I know to keep my wife as healthy as she can be. Any bit you can manage would help."

Fourteen years ago Heather was diagnosed with a type of Ulcerative Colitis that was atypical and unexpected. It had already advanced and spread to the entire colon. She did not respond to typical medical intervention which resulted in adverse reactions to medications  closer monitoring and an inability to control her painful symptoms. What followed was a host of other autoimmune diseases that she’d have to fight against including a rare incurable disease of the liver that increases her risk of terminal cancer  liver transplant  and shortened life expectancy  a devastating blow while she was preparing for emergency surgery to remove her diseased colon. The last two years have been filled with countless trips to the ER  ambulance rides to Albany Med and St. Peters  and being informed twice by Drs. that had she had waited any longer she would have died. Septic Shock the first time  and more recently  a post surgical complication causing her intestines to twist and seal themselves. By the time they operated her abdominal cavity was filled with blood  stool and a life threatening infection.If you know Heather  you know she is more comfortable with giving help than receiving.  After much encouragement  we helped her to see there are a group of people that want to help. I have no doubt she is already contemplating ways to pay this forward.  So here we are  on Heathers behalf  reaching out for your help.  If you would like to donate to someone that truly works hard to help herself  this is it.  If you are looking to help a person that is truly selfless  this is it.  If you want to help support a single mother of three that really IS that amazing mother you see on Facebook?? THIS IS IT! Here’s what she needsHeather needs to heal; her disease is aggravated by stress which further reduces her immune system. If we could raise enough to help cover the bills that go well beyond what she receives in child support  she can rest easy and give her body the time it needs to heal. Expenses include heat  electricity  car insurance  trash pickup  sewer and water  health Insurance for her and three kids  medical supplies  prescriptions  endless co-pays and a growing tally of out of pocket medical expenses.Heather has big plans for the future  but the one that keeps her from giving in to this disease is to be well enough to raise her children the way she always has  and if we can give her the ability to help those kids become even half the person she is  we have made a difference.  Heathers parents  siblings and her “Tribe”  thank you for your support.With Love Team Heather"

I've put off making this post for as long as I could  hoping things would get better  but unfortunately they have not.As most of you are aware  the last few months have not been kind. Back in November of 2018 I wound up needing an emergency MRI to determine whether I was at risk of a stroke or brain bleed  following a severe trauma to my neck that left me in profound and debilitating pain for several weeks  on top of my other chronic long term conditions and disabilities. It was extremely scary and worrying  but thankfully I had a good support base  and look good in scrubs.Fortunately the scan came back in the clear  and the pain and other symptoms were attributed to a severe muscle tear that spanned from the base of my skull  all the way around the entire right side of my head. I am now 9ish weeks into the estimated 12 week healing process and doing well  and while we are truly grateful my brain was okay  unfortunately our finances have taken a major hit as a result of the MRI  as it was also during this emergency visit to the hospital that we found out our health insurance had wrongly dropped me due to a change in my immigration status  meaning I was completely without coverage without any idea of having been dropped.  We contacted our insurance provider (Blue Cross) immediately about this and were told they would look into it  but nothing has come of it and I have been left to pay the MRI bill. The initial cost of the MRI was estimated to be $2-3k  but following some complications and needing a more complex scan  the bill wound up at $5 731.33. This does not include the cost of pain management or physical rehab.As you can see  the hospital has already removed $2 636.41 from this total  (though an additional $800 was tacked on from a separate radiology department where my results were sent to for processing) leaving us with a bill of roughly $3 094.92 which we could have managed in monthly installments...if my partner  known affectionately to most of you as ETD and on occasion \"Mothman\" hadn't been told he needed wisdom tooth surgery as a matter of some urgency or risk major infection.We took out a loan to cover the cost of his surgery and he's scheduled to go in for the procedure this month  and while we could have managed to juggle things for a bit  we also found out at Christmas that my mother has cancer  and I will likely need to fly home to the UK (on my own) pretty soon to try and help deal with that. Even still we had hoped to muddle through for a while  but as of today February 4th 2019  my desktop computer has died  taking with it my ability to work. It's my sole source of income and needless to say I'm lost without it. Worse yet Patreon announced this last week that they are suffering from delayed payment processing again  meaning I will not get paid in time  and the month of February and beyond has finally gotten too much for us and we need help.I know times are hard for everyone  and I always hoped I would never have to do this again  but anything you could do to help would be greatly appreciated.  In reality we need somewhere around $4-5k  but I am hoping to get just enough to take my monthly bills to the hospital down to a manageable amount. Doing so would allow us to pay it off gradually over time  and afford us time to breathe.If we somehow manage to meet and go over the target goal  all extra funds will go toward clearing off the medical debt in full  and also possibly PC repairs to get me back to work asap. Thank you for your support and kind words over these last few months  it means the world to both of us and we're beyond humbled that you allow us to be part of your lives. Take care  and thank you again. With all our love and gratitude Joy & ETD."

Fortunately  the doctors caught it in time and were able to perform a successful surgery. Fast forward to the fall of 2018  Brendon was feeling discomfort and went in for scans. He soon learned the cancer was back  only this time it was significantly more aggressive. The doctors informed Brendon that he needed surgery and chemotherapy treatment immediately  and they agreed to move forward. Unknown to Brendon at the time  his health insurance had been revoked. On November 1st  the doctors performed a nine-hour surgery and a chemo wash. They were able to remove multiple tumors. However  due to the location of the tumors  they had to cut his femoral nerve  which caused him to lose mobility in his right leg. A day before being discharged from the hospital  Brendon learned his lymph nodes had tested positive for cancer. He was later diagnosed with stage four. He has since been in and out of the hospital for numerous procedures  and he recently started a rigorous chemo treatment that will last six months. Brendon has devoted his entire life to his family  farming  and ranching. He has two little boys and another baby due in February. He is an incredible father  son  partner  brother  friend  and uncle. He farms and ranches in Medicine Lodge  Kansas  but the cancer has prevented Brendon from working for the past four months. Uncle Brendon has always been there for us without expecting anything in return. He is first in line to help when crisis strikes. He is the strongest person we know  and it is our turn to be strong for him. Please help us support Uncle Brendon kick cancers ass.Thank you for your support."

I worked evening shift as a Respiratory Therapist in a busy trauma center in Charleston  SC and realized that driving home in the dark was suddenly difficult. I had trouble seeing the monitors and reading charts.  A visit to my Ophthalmologist  determined that I have Retinitis Pigmentosis  a degenerative retinal disease that is causing me to lose my peripheral vision  the ability to see at night and eventually render me blind. I was caught off guard by this diagnosis and to learn there is no cure. This is an inherited disease and my then 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with a form of it as well. In 2016 I had to leave the career I loved because I could no longer drive at night and provide life saving treatments on critically ill patients. Glasses and traditional treatments will not help this condition. If left untreated I will eventually lose most if not all of my vision. I have lost much of my peripheral vision already and can not manage in the dark without assistance. My right eye has almost lost all central vision and what remains is cloudy.There is an ongoing clinical study being conducted that will accept me as a patient but the treatments are not covered by my health insurance. The out of pocket costs for this stem cell treatment amounts to almost $20 000 for both eyes. Additionally there is the cost of staying in Florida for a week and time off of work for me and my husband  Lee. The ongoing results of patients with this treatment show much improved vision over a 6 month period after treatment and the vision remains stable.  Any help provided to me will not only improve my vision   but make this treatment available to my daughter in future years and will also provide awareness of this debilitating disease.Please consider helping me reach this goal by making even a small donation and sharing my story through your social media accounts. “For I know the plans I have for you \" declares the Lord  \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you  plans to give you a hope and a future.\" Jeremiah 29:11Tammy Jackson"

Patricia is a Navy veteran who until recently was working as a nurse at a long term care facility taking care of others. Most people who know my mom know that she is a kind  loving \"mama bear\" who enjoys helping others. She has opened her home to those in need and has always given what she could to assist others. Now she needs your help.On October 15th 2018 my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 invasive ductal carcinoma  3B with lymph node involvement. Due to the advanced state of her breast cancer the doctors have told us that she needs to start treatment immediately. Doctors have recommended a treatment plan of 1 year chemotherapy along with surgery to remove all tissue affected.  Unfortunately because of all the medical appointments not allowing her to maintain her work hours  on October 23rd she went to work for the last time at the job she loves. She no longer has medical insurance because she was forced to leave her job and is not currently eligible for Medicaid because she \"made too much money\" in the last 30 days. She was supposed to start her chemotherapy today  November 2nd  but because her insurance coverage ended at the end of October her treatment has been \"delayed\".  Although we have found a medical insurance solution  it will not begin until December 1st 2018. My mom needs life saving treatment as soon as possible! We are asking for donations to help cover the cost of Patricia's new health insurance that has a very high monthly premium and deductible. Also  some of the diagnostic tests to include a 3D mammogram along with full body scans were \"approved\" by her previous insurance but the costs are not fully being covered. Patricia has already incurred some medical debt and her treatment hasn't even begun! Although she hopes to return to work helping others again  right now she is unable to earn an income and is relying on the generosity of family and friends to get her through this difficult time. I pray that my daughter will grow up making memories with her amazing  strong  beautiful and very proud grandmother. Any and every bit of help towards Patricia's breast cancer battle will be forever appreciated. Thank you!"

She was born without one kidney  a bladder  colon and has had her uterus surgically removed.  Every second day she goes for treatment at Zagreb’s Rebro hospital and for her to have a normal life she requires bladder surgery and a kidney transplant. Apart the Croatian president became familiar with her case  Vanesa was finally given an opportunity and has been accepted at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center on 26 November. A series of operations await Vanesa in America  such as bladder enlargement  catheterization  and depending on her condition after that  a kidney transplant. All the hospital expenses  as her mother Kruna explains  will be covered by The Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO)  but this only sorts out part of the problem for the Dolenec family.“I need to raise money for airline tickets  visas and accommodation because we have to pay for this all ourselves. According to the agreement with the doctors  Vanesa must be there (in America) until the end of May next year because it is a very long process and she would need to go into the hospital every three weeks. In the meantime we need to stay somewhere  we have to eat and this is all a big cost  especially for us as we have spent our last kuna on treatment for our daughter ” Kruna said. Kruna has reached out to a number of different associations but with no luck.

Thankfully his mom was there as well so she called 911 while I kept talking to Anthony and was trying to keep him conscious. The EMTs and firefighters were there within just a few minutes and took Anthony to the hospital. They told me I couldn’t ride with them. I wasn’t thrilled but thinking back it was probably for the best. At some point on the way to the hospital  Anthony went into cardiac arrest and flatlined. They were able to bring him back but he flatlined again as soon as he got into the ER. I am beyond grateful they were able to bring him back both times.It certainly hasn’t been an easy road for any of us. Anthony was intubated for close to 5 days in the ICU. It turns out he had massive blood clots in each lung. This caused the breathing issues  stress to his heart  and is ultimately what led to the cardiac arrest. Those first few days were rough. The thought that he might not make it through is more terrifying than I can ever explain. But with everything going on  I didn’t let those doubts and fears consume me.There are a million thank yous to give out. Thank you to both mine and Anthony’s friends and family who were there for us. Whether you were there physically or over the phone  it was so comforting to know that we had people there for us. Thank you to all the amazing doctors  nurses  and therapists at Memorial and Brooks Rehab that took amazing care of him. Anthony would not be here without them and there are not enough thank yous in the world to express my appreciation to them. Thank you to our amazing job and coworkers. Our job has been so understanding and thoughtful during this time. And many of our coworkers donated PTO to ensure Anthony would continue to receive his full check as short-term disability only provides 60%.Unfortunately  during all that happened  Anthony lost his eyesight. If you know Anthony  then you know his passion for photography and his modeling agency. To see someone so full of life and passion go through what he’s gone through is heartbreaking. Without his eyesight  Anthony can’t do what he loves the most. That along with losing mobility and speech have been extremely hard on him. The amazing therapists at Brooks were able to help him with the mobility and speech issues and he’s nearly back to 100% in that area. His eyesight has come back some  but he can only see colors and shapes of people through his peripherals. This has been a very tough transition for him. He’s seen several specialists and will continue to see more until they can figure out why his vision is gone and what  if anything  they can do to restore it.While we do have great health insurance  there are still a lot of bills to pay. So far  Anthony has racked up over $480 000 in medical bills. We are only responsible for $4500 of that  thank goodness. That is still a lot to pay and more than we can afford to spare. We are trying to raise $3500 to help cover our part of the costs. Anything you can do to help is very much appreciated. We are not normally ones to ask for help but at a time like this it’s needed. Our families have been so wonderful and giving during this time but we don’t want to continue to rely on them as they have their own responsibilities to take care of.Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. If you can’t donate  we completely understand. Believe me. But we ask that you do share this and help us meet our goal.With much love  Anthony and Hallah."

Since that day  Kathleen has relentlessly battled cancer with every ounce of energy she has.  Her journey began with a right lung resection and postoperative recovery that gave her 24 months of health and happiness that she took full advantage of with her family and friends.  Unfortunately  this happy cancer free time didn’t last long and only marked the beginning of my mom’s 10-year battle against cancer.  The primary tumor had metastasized prior to her lung resection and my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2011.   She endured three different brain surgeries  a brain infection  countless rounds of localized radiation therapy and ultimately immunotherapy treatment with Avastin and Keytruda as a last attempt to control the relentless spread of cancer throughout her body.  Miraculously  my mother’s tumors responded to Keytruda  but complications resulting from the immune response led to lung toxicity and intracranial hemorrhage that has left my mom on oxygen  non-ambulatory and unable to care for herself.I have been my mother’s primary caregiver since 2009 and together we have battled this disease with love  laughter  tears  perseverance and unbreakable wills that won’t ever give up.  There have been many highs along the way but each low is now getting more challenging for us to manage and we know that the gift of time can only last so long and we need to cherish every moment we have together.  Making this trying time even more difficult is that our health insurance and a hospice care agency has failed to provide the ongoing support  treatment and care that my mom requires. This disappointing and stressful situation has forced me to use personal savings to provide private care that my mom requires.  My mom is a fighter even in her 18-month hospice journey and we are thankful for every minute we have with her  but the long fight has depleted our resources.  The support from our GoFundMe will go directly to providing 24 hour home health aides  certified nursing assistants  medications  medical supplies  and therapists to manage painful symptoms of spasticity  rigidity and ongoing health challenges related to Metastatic Cancer  Advanced COPD  and complications from an Intracranial Stroke.  Any support you can provide will be a great help and deeply appreciated.  Also  if you could please forward and share Kathleen's story with friends and family in your network we would be forever grateful.A HEARTFELT THANK YOU to each and every one of you for taking the time to read and share Kathleen's cancer journey. As with all cancer cases  this has been a battle  we are so grateful for all the wonderful support Mom has received over the years from our community of family  friends  and clinicians during her decade of treatments. The journey has not been an easy one but we continue to cherish each day as a gift and every day we are reminded of how fragile our lives can be. ❤️ Xo"

The first time I met toddler Ruby  she immediately hugged me and called me Ahn-tay (Auntie) and melted my heart. And Anna's hubs/Ruby's dad Matt a.k.a. Giant Ruby--he's pretty cool too.  I mean  I want to be like  no one is good enough for my cousin! But he's proven himself through his endless support of his wife and daughter. They are honestly the most precious family! As many of you may know  in August 2017  when Ruby was just a wee one  Anna was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer that had spread to her liver. As you may also know  Anna kicked its ass--mostly. She's endured 13 rounds of intensive chemo  one week of intense radiation  one major surgery and a second surgery that was supposed to make the last of the liver tumors die away. This warrior woman has been through it all.Unfortunately  the last surgery wasn't fully successful  and new scans show the tumors still in her liver.This is where you come in  friends. This amazing  ass-kicking mama needs your help for the next round of treatments. The new treatment is called Y90 with Radio-embolization  and Anna will also be taking a chemo pill in combination with a liver angiogram which involves injecting the liver with microspheres that will emit radiation for twelve days. Anna and Matt are still waiting to find out if insurance will cover all this. And  through all of the treatments  Matt will continue working extremely long hours to meet expenses and maintain their health insurance. Fatigue is the number one symptom that Anna will face  so it will be difficult to care for Ruby or do work around the house.They'll use the money donated here to hire a nanny for Ruby  especially during the two weeks in which Anna can have no contact with her at all due to the radiation. It will also be used for any part of the treatments that insurance won't cover  and household expenses that might come up. This mama urgently needs your help. She is the strongest person I know--and the money raised here will help her maintain that strength through this difficult process  and will help take care of little Ruby.

Since childhood Dani has been under constant medical care for her diverse ailments  yet we have never received an explanation about the true origin of her painful digestive problems and overall delicate health. Now Dani’s digestive tract issues have become more severe than ever  seriously affecting not only her stomach but also her colon and duodenum. Last year she lost 17 pounds in an alarmingly short time  without any apparent reason. Since then she has undergone a battery of medical tests  but all results have come back either negative or inconclusive. Her symptoms are presently being treated  but none of her doctors has been able to determine the root cause of her illness. Dani is currently 25 pounds below the minimum normal weight for her age and height  and continues to lose weight on a weekly basis  despite regularly eating a balanced and nourishing diet.  We’re frustrated and desperate  watching our beloved daughter progressively get thinner and weaker with no definitive diagnosis or cure in sight.  Conventional medicine has failed Daniela  and we’re convinced that our only hope for resolving her health issues is \"functional medicine \" which seeks to identify and treat the root cause of diseases. It views the body as one integrated system  and not a collection of independent organs. It treats the whole system  and not just the symptoms.Unfortunately  her health insurance does not cover functional medicine  and we don’t have the resources needed to pay the high cost of tests  treatments  and nutrition that Daniela may require for an extended period of time.

Desde entonces se ha sometido a numerosos exámenes médicos  cuyos resultados han sido negativos o inconcluyentes. Actualmente le están tratando sus síntomas  pero ninguno de sus médicos ha podido determinar la causa raíz de su enfermedad. Dani actualmente está 25 libras por debajo del peso mínimo normal que debería tener según su edad y estatura  y sigue adelgazando cada semana  a pesar de alimentarse muy bien con una dieta balanceada y nutritiva.  Estamos frustrados y desesperados  viendo a nuestra amada hija perder peso y debilitarse progresivamente  sin un diagnóstico definitivo ni una cura a la vista.

Since my mom got cancer 9 years ago I have been studying alternative cancer therapies so I knew that I had to explore this route for myself to make a well rounded decision on a treatment plan.  I left a voicemail with a Naturopathic Oncologist in NH on Sunday night.  I did not expect to be able to see him but at least wanted to have a conversation and opinion over the phone.  Monday morning (President's Day)  my phone rings as I am getting out of the shower.  It was his office asking me if I could be there in 2 hours...the lady with the 12:00appointment called and cancelled because of the flu.  They usually book out 6-8weeks.  HOLY DIVINE APPOINTMENT!  We are 1 1/2 hours from his office.  We booked it!  I now have him on my team to work alongside my conventional team to give my body the best fighting change to overcome this cancer.  I started taking supplements on Tuesday and restricting my diet to inhibit the growth and spread of the cancer.  It's not easy.  I'm weak and tired from all the stress.Moving on to our 3rd opinion - scheduled for Thursday at noon.  I had to stop by Beth Israel to pick up my chest CT scan to bring over to MGH.  Marc had prayed earlier that morning and asked God to just let us hear something or see something that would confirm for us the decision we felt He was leading us to make.  We were one block away from BI and got stuck at a red light partially into the intersection.  Cars started going around us...then the light switched for pedestrians to cross.  Of all the people in Boston crossing the street  who would you think crossed the street right smack in front of our car but Dr. Awtrey  the surgeon from BI.  I waved and said hi to him and we went on our way to our appointment at MGH.  That was another DIVINE APPOINTMENT. He put us both there at that moment in this big city.  It was clear to us that the Lord was leading us to Dr. Awtrey.  WE all felt it in our hearts.  Our meeting at MGH confirmed it as well.  He was encouraging  in agreement with Dr. Awtrey  and said he'd send his own family to him.  That's all I needed.MY surgery is scheduled for Thursday  FEB. 28th at Beth Israel with Dr. Chris Awtrey.  It's a big surgery.  When I wake up I will be in complete menopause.  There is so much I am afraid of  but I'm trying to rest in the peace of God.  Here's how you can pray for us:1.  That God would choose to heal me 2.  For the best choices to be made for hormone replacement therapy 3.  For a speedy recovery (I will be recovering at home about a month before starting chemo)4.  For my family who will be caring for me - for strength - comfort5.  For anything else my tired mind can't remember right now :)I thank God for all of you in my life - I count it joy to go through this struggle because I know there is a greater purpose - somewhere over the rainbow...With Love DeannaDo not grieve  for the joy of the Lord is your strength.

I'm a stay at home mom to our son which I feel so lucky to get to do so.Some of you may know that I have a very hard time seeing. Most of you probably don't know that I have a eye disease that I have been struggling with for half of my life. I was first diagnosed with KERATOCONUS in my late teens. Glasses can't correct my vision due to Keratoconus  and back then my only options were cornea transplants or (RGP) Rigid Gas Permeable lenses.In my early 20's I moved to South Lake Tahoe CA and needed to get a new drivers license. I was unable to pass the vision test for DMV. So I went to a eye doctor and  was diagnosed for a 2nd time. The doctor was in shock I was even able to drive to his office. I told him I needed to be able to pass a vision test to get a drivers license. He fitted me for RGP contact lenses that were so painful to wear  it felt like shards of glass were in my eyes. I was able to use them long enough to pass the vision test to get my CA drivers license. Since I was never able to get used to the RGP lenses  the doctor advised I stop wearing them and look into cornea transplants. The thought of transplants with a risk of not working and losing sight completely  Freaked me out! So i did nothing and have been struggling ever since. Fast forward to now and the time has come that I need to be able to see! Technology has advanced so much that now I have a option for non-invasive procedures that will stop my degenerative eye disease and correct my vision so that I can see clearly  basically for the 1st time in my life. I'll be 40yrs old in March and my drivers license expires and DMV is making me go in for a vision test. I will not be able to pass and continue to drive without getting my eyes fixed.So What Is Keratoconus?It's a progressive corneal eye disease  it thins the cornea and forms it into a cone-like shape. Keratoconus is a degenerative condition  left untreated can result in the cornea bulging out so far the back layer of the cornea can rip open and the internal eye liquid rushes in and swells up the cornea. It will take 3-6 months of non-usable vision until fluid goes away. The cornea then will have a lot of new scarring and vision will be permanently worse. Also left untreated can result in only option being a painful invasive cornea transplant surgery.Some symptoms are:  Blurred & Double vision/ Sensitivity to light/ Glares & Halos/ Progressive nearsightedness/ Poor night visionI need 2 procedures done on both of my eyes. The 1st is called Holcomb C3-R Crosslinking  which will stabilize the Keratoconus from getting worse. It has a 99.3% success rate. The 2nd procedure is call Intacs. Intacs are tiny  clear  semi-circle inserts which will be placed in the peripheral layer of the cornea. Intacs reshape the curvature of the cornea from within. The cornea flattens which helps achieve more clear vision  less distortion  glares  double vision  and improved night vision. We'll have travel expenses as well due to we will have to travel to Southern California for a 3 day visit with the Ophthalmologist.Unfortunately this life changing procedure isn't FDA approved  which means health insurance doesn't cover it. So this is why we are putting our pride to the side and reaching out for helping hands to assist us with financial help. Its very scary to think in order for me to halt the progression of my eye disease and truly see how beautiful the world is for the 1st time  we'll have to go into financial debt.Thank you for taking the time to read my story and any amount is helpful and greatly appreciated!Much Love April  Sebastian & KannonThe Combes Family"

Various tests and scans confirm that the cancer has spread from Renee's lungs to her lymph nodes within the upper chest as well as lymph nodes near the collar bone  neck  and armpit. Fortunately  there is no sign of cancer on her major organs or brain. A rare ROS1 gene mutation (found in 1-2% of lung cancer patients) was identified meaning Renee will receive targeted treatment. On the down side  she still has to fight cancer. Not only is it a physical and mental battle  but it's a financial one as well. Lung cancer is still one of the most expensive cancers to treat. Even with good health insurance  treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy come with financial concern and unexpected costs. Our family would like to be financially prepared for medical expenses to help us focus on increasing and maintaining Renee's quality of life while fighting the war against lung cancer.Please donate today to help Renee!BACKGROUNDRenee  remarried for 23 years  mother of two and grandmother of one  worked in sales and marketing for years and decided to change careers and work with adults with disabilities. As a program coordinator in charge of 20 staff members and 60 participants  her goal is to empower persons with developmental disabilities to achieve greater self-sufficiency and lead richer lives. In mid-September Renee felt two bumps on her collar bone and thought they might go away. They didn't. In early-October she went in for a biopsy and received the news that she had lung cancer which had spread to her lymph nodes. Being a non-smoker  the news was a complete shock to us all. Even though there is a long road ahead  Renee is filled with great optimism and strength and is supported by many during this time.DIAGNOSIS: SCANS AND TESTSRenee had a biopsy  blood work  PET scan  MRI scan  genomic test  confirmatory FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) test  and EKG done before starting treatment.TREATMENTRenee will be on a ROS1 targeted treatment called Xalkori (crizotinib)  a chemotherapy pill.CURRENT CONDITIONRenee is fortunately healthy enough to walk  breathe  and function without too much pain. She has made the decision to continue going to work when she can and live the life she wants to live while being treated.“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist  that is all.” -Oscar Wilde.LUNG CANCER FACTS-Lung cancer kills more people than breast  colon  and prostate cancers combined.-Lung cancer receives the least amount of federal research funding. 6% of federal research dollars spent on cancer research  are spent on lung cancer.-641 people will be diagnosed each day.-27 people will be diagnosed each hour.-Every 2 ½ minutes someone in the U.S. is told that he or she has lung cancer.-Smoking isn’t the only cause of lung cancer.

She has dedicated her life to helping others by becoming a nurse. Mel was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. This is not her first time down this road. As a teenager  Mel survived an aggressive tumor requiring radiation and surgery and a melanoma a few years ago. Despite this  Mel is still her funny  weird  upbeat self and powering through this.Mel and her care team are optimistic about her prognosis  but her path to healing will be a long and arduous one.  The doctors believe the tumor is benign  but the only way to know is to have the surgery. Treatment involves brain surgery to remove the tumor. Her skull will have to be reconstructed and she'll spend several days in the Neurological ICU before being able to go home. Surgery is just the beginning of a long road to healing. She won’t be able to drive/bike or be left alone for several weeks after the procedure. This is going to be really tough because Mel is active and busy and constantly on the go. She is also fiercely independent and is usually the one taking care of other people. She’s not used to asking for help  but she needs it so we are circling the wagons and asking for your help and support. Although Mel has health insurance  it won’t cover all her medical expenses. We’re raising these funds to help Mel cover additional expenses outside of surgery and supplement her income as she goes through surgery and recovery.Please help in any way that you can. Any amount will be a tremendous gift during this time. If you can’t donate  please share with your network and those who know and love Mely. She will also be in need of rides and company during her recovery.Here's Mel in her own words:“Family/Friends I apologize if I haven’t reached out to you directly  but this process has been logistically  physically  mentally  and emotionally exhausting.I was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. I am sure many of you  like myself  have a multitude of questions. Much at this point is unknown  and it is likely the answers to many questions will remain unknown until I complete the healing process. I do know that this type of brain tumor is usually benign (non-cancerous) and that imaging shows no additional tumors in my brain stem or spine.  Based on my symptoms my tumor removal is non-emergent  but the tumor is sizable so the longer I wait the larger it grows  the older I get the harder my recovery  and the greater I run the risk of developing more serious symptoms. Treatment is a frontotemporal craniotomy for total tumor resection. This involves removing a portion of my skull to cut out the tumor. My skull will then be reconstructed (I do not know what that entails). Due to vascular involvement  I MAY have an additional neurovascular procedure (this will require meeting with another surgeon). I will spend several days in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit before being discharged home. I will not be able to drive/bike or be left alone for several weeks due to potential complications related to my procedure.I am sure some of you have additional questions and/or will want to reach out to me. I ask that you refrain from asking me specifics about my tumor or my surgery. While I feel the love in these questions  answering them repeatedly puts my illness at the forefront of my mind and inhibits my ability to focus on the more positive aspects of my life. It is also disheartening to continuously be asked questions I do not have the answers to. If you would like to reach out to see how I am doing  I ask that you e-mail me  as many texts (while sent with the best intentions) can be daunting. Despite this unfortunate diagnosis  I am my usual goofy self. It’s going to take a lot more than a brain tumor to derail this happy train!For my birthday I am hoping you could help me raise money to pay for my medical expenses. For those of you who cannot give money  the gift of your time is appreciated when I need company during the recovery process. Additionally  if anyone knows any brain tumor survivors I could speak with I would be grateful if you could connect us.With love and gratitude Mel\"THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION"

Soy un productor audiovisual de 48 años de Caracas  Venezuela. Hace aproximadamente un mes y medio sufrí un ataque al corazón y me encontré en un estado crítico. La situación económica en mi país (Venezuela) me hizo imposible cubrir los costos relacionados con el tratamiento de emergencia que tuve que someterme. No tenía más remedio que confiar en amigos y familiares para cubrir estos costos médicos.¿Cómo comenzó todo?Sentí dolor de pecho agudo el pasado 21 de noviembre mientras caminaba desde el campus de la universidad hasta la estación de metro. Había empezado a sentirme mal mientras estaba sentado en clase escuchando detonaciones y represión estatal contra la manifestación de estudiantes fuera del edificio de la universidad. Decidí irme a casa cuando me di cuenta de que me sentía mal. A pesar del dolor  logré continuar mi camino a casa usando el transporte público  luchando para no desmayarme. Ya me había desmayado brevemente en el metro unos días antes  lo cual fue particularmente aterrador dada la falta de seguridad en Venezuela (temía que me robaran o me dejaran sin ningún tipo de apoyo de emergencia. Afortunadamente  logré llegar a casa ese día.Los síntomas empeoraron. Mi esposa y yo decidimos que tenía que obtener atención primaria a través del seguro privado que tengo  solo para poder revisarme. Los paramédicos determinaron que tenía que ir a una clínica (no cubierta por el seguro) para realizar todas las pruebas (por ejemplo  ECG) necesarias para verificar si estaba pasando por un ataque cardíaco o no. Efectivamente  tan pronto como me conecté a la máquina de ECG de la clínica  el equipo de emergencia confirmó que estaba sufriendo un ataque al corazón. ¿Qué hay que hacer? Un cateterismo cardíaco y la colocación de una endoprótesis en mi corazón para abrir la obstrucción de la arteria coronaria.¿Cuáles fueron los costos?Como usted bien sabe  Venezuela está pasando por una de las peores hiperinflaciones de la región y del mundo (la inflación ha superado el 1 millón por ciento anual). Por esa razón  mi seguro de salud se ha convertido en algo insignificante. ¡Cubre menos de un dólar! Sin embargo  el costo total de mi estadía y tratamiento en el hospital costó $ 6 500  que tuvimos que pedir prestados a familiares y amigos. Les estoy profundamente agradecido por su generosidad y ahora tengo que pagarles por su apoyo en un momento tan difícil. Además  tengo que adquirir un seguro de salud en dólares a partir de ahora. En este momento  la cobertura de salud que necesito tiene un valor de 500 US $.Actualmente estoy en la fase de recuperación. Estoy asistiendo a chequeos médicos y haciendo diferentes exámenes.Como productor audiovisual mi trabajo no garantiza un salario mensual estable. Lo que gano por proyecto no es suficiente para cubrir mi deuda o adquirir la cobertura de salud adecuada. Por eso decidí apelar a la buena fe de esta gran comunidad para pagar mi deuda y adquirir un seguro de salud basado en el dólar. La ayuda total que busco es de 7.000 US $.Sé que muchas personas lo apoyan  pero no pueden ayudarlo financieramente  hay muchos venezolanos que atraviesan tiempos difíciles  por lo que les pido que me ayuden a difundir esta campaña lo más lejos posible. Cada poquito ayuda.Dios los bendiga a todos Tomás GodoyP.S: Esta campaña es administrada por mi Amiga  María Alejandra Morillo  quien recibirá los fondos en mi nombre  ya que no tengo una cuenta en el extranjero.Hi! My name is Tomás. I am a 48 years old audiovisual producer from Caracas  Venezuela. About a month and a half ago I suffered a heart attack and found myself in a critical state. The economic situation in my country (Venezuela) made it impossible for me to cover the costs involved in dealing with the emergency treatment I had to undergo.  I had no option but to rely on friends and relatives in order to cover these medical costs. How did it all begin?            I felt acute chest pain last November 21 while walking from the university campus to the subway station. I had begun to feel ill while sitting in class listening to detonations and state repression against student's demonstration outside the university building. I decided to go home when I realized I was feeling unwell.  Despite the pain  I managed to continue my way home using public transport  struggling not to faint. I had already fainted briefly in the subway a few days before  which was particularly scary given the lack of security in Venezuela (I feared being robbed or left without any emergency support. Fortunately  I managed to get home that day. Symptoms worsened. My wife and I decided that I had to get primary care through the private insurance I have  just so I could be checked. Paramedics determined that I had to go to a clinic (not covered by insurance) to do all tests (e.g. ECG) required in order to check whether or not I was going through a heart attack. Sure enough  as soon as I was connected to the Clinic's ECG machine the emergency team confirmed I was going through a heart attack. What needed to be done? a cardiac catheterization and placement of a stend in my heart in order to open the obstruction of the Coronary artery.What were the costs?            As you may well know  Venezuela is currently going through one of the worst hyperinflations of the region and the world (inflation has surpassed 1 million percent annually). For that reason  my health insurance has become rather insignificant. It covers less than a dollar! However  the total cost of my stay and treatment in the hospital cost 6 500 US$  which we had to borrow from family and friends. I am deeply thankful to them for their generosity and now have to pay them back for their support during such a difficult time. In addition  I need to acquire a dollar-denominated health insurance from now on. At the moment the health coverage I require is worth 500 US$. I am currently in the recovery phase. I am attending medical checkups and doing different tests. As an audiovisual producer my work does not guarantee a stable monthly salary. What I earn per project is not enough to cover my debt or acquire appropriate health coverage. That is why I decided to appeal to the good faith of this great community in order to pay my debt and acquire a dollar-based health insurance. The total help I seek is 7 000 US$I know many people are supportive but cannot help financially  there are many Venezuelans going through tough times so I ask you help me spread this campaign as far and wide as possible. Every little bit helps.God bless you all             Tomás"

Since childhood Dani has been under constant medical care for her diverse ailments  yet we have never received an explanation about the true origin of her painful digestive problems and overall delicate health. Now Dani’s digestive tract issues have become more severe than ever  seriously affecting not only her stomach but also her colon and duodenum. Last year she lost 17 pounds in an alarmingly short time  without any apparent reason. Since then she has undergone a battery of medical tests  but all results have come back either negative or inconclusive.

Dani is currently 25 pounds below the minimum normal weight for her age and height  and continues to lose weight on a weekly basis  despite regularly eating a balanced and nourishing diet.  We’re frustrated and desperate  watching our beloved daughter progressively get thinner and weaker with no definitive diagnosis or cure in sight.  Conventional medicine has failed Daniela  and we’re convinced that our only hope for resolving her health issues is \"functional medicine \" which seeks to identify and treat the root cause of diseases. It views the body as one integrated system  and not a collection of independent organs. It treats the whole system  and not just the symptoms.Unfortunately  her health insurance does not cover functional medicine  and we don’t have the resources needed to pay the high cost of tests  treatments  and nutrition that Daniela may require for an extended period of time.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts… and God bless you!¡POR FAVOR AYUDEN A DANI A SANARSE!A lo largo de su vida  nuestra hija Daniela  de 19 años  ha padecido una variedad de problemas de salud recurrentes  tales como infecciones agudas de garganta  complicaciones renales  taquicardia  debilidad general y problemas digestivos; entre ellos  una gastritis crónica que le comenzó a los 6 años de edad y que la ha mandado al departamento de emergencia en muchas ocasiones. Desde pequeña  Dani ha estado bajo constante tratamiento médico para sus distintos padecimientos  pero nunca hemos recibido explicación alguna sobre el origen real de sus dolorosos problemas digestivos  ni de su frágil salud en general.   Ahora los problemas digestivos de Dani se han vuelto más severos que nunca  y le están afectando no solo el estómago sino también el colon y duodeno. El año pasado  ella perdió 17 libras en un plazo de tiempo alarmantemente corto  sin ninguna razón aparente. Desde entonces se ha sometido a numerosos exámenes médicos  cuyos resultados han sido negativos o inconcluyentes. Actualmente le están tratando sus síntomas  pero ninguno de sus médicos ha podido determinar la causa raíz de su enfermedad. Dani actualmente está 25 libras por debajo del peso mínimo normal que debería tener según su edad y estatura  y sigue adelgazando cada semana  a pesar de alimentarse muy bien con una dieta balanceada y nutritiva.  Estamos frustrados y desesperados  viendo a nuestra amada hija perder peso y debilitarse progresivamente  sin un diagnóstico definitivo ni una cura a la vista. La medicina convencional le ha fallado a Daniela  y estamos convencidos de que nuestra única esperanza para resolver sus problemas de salud es la \"medicina funcional\"  la cual se concentra en descubrir y tratar la causa raíz de las enfermedades. Ve el cuerpo como un sistema integrado  y no una colección de órganos independientes. Trata todo el sistema  y no sólo los síntomas. Pero su seguro de salud no cubre la medicina funcional  y nosotros no tenemos los recursos económicos necesarios para cubrir los altos costos de exámenes  tratamientos y nutrición que Daniela pudiera necesitar por un tiempo prolongado. Por eso estamos acudiendo a ustedes para pedirles que nos ayuden a poner a Dani bajo el cuidado de un reconocido especialista en medicina funcional  dedicado a encontrar el origen de sus padecimientos y así poder curarla totalmente... ¡de una vez por todas! Estudiante de Sicología en su primer año de universidad  Daniela es una chica linda  inteligente y amante de la vida  con grandes sueños y metas que desea cumplir. Pero cada día que pasa sin encontrarse la causa de su enfermedad es crucial.  Por favor ayuden a Dani a sanarse para que pueda vivir una vida brillante  exitosa y sana! Cualquier cantidad que puedan donar será muy agradecida. Gracias de todo corazón… ¡y que Dios los bendiga!"

He was transferred out of Mary Washington Hospital to VCU in Richmond last night to get a better determination of what is going on. Barry has always been a very hard worker trying to support his family and get his daughters through college and an upcoming wedding. He was a firefighter for Spotsylvania County for several years and on the Virginia Defense Force for 7 years as Sargent. He also coached and managed softball for East Orange Little League. He has been an auto body technician for over 25 years.  Barry is the type of person that would do anything he could to help someone and now it is our turn to help him and his family. Due to being hospitalized his health insurance has been hard to keep up with and paid as well as the rest of his bills.  His wife has had to take time off from work for all the procedures and now has to travel almost an hour to the hospital he has been transferred to. All donations will go to Barry and his family to help get them through this difficult time. Everyone that knows Barry  knows he would never ask for anything and that is why we have made this Go Fund Me Page to show our support to him and his family. Thank you so much.

Since my mom got cancer 9 years ago I have been studying alternative cancer therapies so I knew that I had to explore this route for myself to make a well rounded decision on a treatment plan.  I left a voicemail with a Naturopathic Oncologist in NH on Sunday night.  I did not expect to be able to see him but at least wanted to have a conversation and opinion over the phone.  Monday morning (President's Day)  my phone rings as I am getting out of the shower.  It was his office asking me if I could be there in 2 hours...the lady with the 12:00appointment called and cancelled because of the flu.  They usually book out 6-8weeks.  HOLY DIVINE APPOINTMENT!  We are 1 1/2 hours from his office.  We booked it!  I now have him on my team to work alongside my conventional team to give my body the best fighting change to overcome this cancer.  I started taking supplements on Tuesday and restricting my diet to inhibit the growth and spread of the cancer.  It's not easy.  I'm weak and tired from all the stress.Moving on to our 3rd opinion - scheduled for Thursday at noon.  I had to stop by Beth Israel to pick up my chest CT scan to bring over to MGH.  Marc had prayed earlier that morning and asked God to just let us hear something or see something that would confirm for us the decision we felt He was leading us to make.  We were one block away from BI and got stuck at a red light partially into the intersection.  Cars started going around us...then the light switched for pedestrians to cross.  Of all the people in Boston crossing the street  who would you think crossed the street right smack in front of our car but Dr. Awtrey  the surgeon from BI.  I waved and said hi to him and we went on our way to our appointment at MGH.  That was another DIVINE APPOINTMENT. He put us both there at that moment in this big city.  It was clear to us that the Lord was leading us to Dr. Awtrey.  WE all felt it in our hearts.  Our meeting at MGH confirmed it as well.  He was encouraging  in agreement with Dr. Awtrey  and said he'd send his own family to him.  That's all I needed.MY surgery is scheduled for Thursday  FEB. 28th at Beth Israel with Dr. Chris Awtrey.  It's a big surgery.  When I wake up I will be in complete menopause.  There is so much I am afraid of  but I'm trying to rest in the peace of God.  Here's how you can pray for us:1.  That God would choose to heal me 2.  For the best choices to be made for hormone replacement therapy 3.  For a speedy recovery (I will be recovering at home about a month before starting chemo)4.  For my family who will be caring for me - for strength - comfort5.  For anything else my tired mind can't remember right now :)I thank God for all of you in my life - I count it joy to go through this struggle because I know there is a greater purpose - somewhere over the rainbow...With Love DeannaDo not grieve  for the joy of the Lord is your strength.

I'm a stay at home mom to our son which I feel so lucky to get to do so.Some of you may know that I have a very hard time seeing. Most of you probably don't know that I have a eye disease that I have been struggling with for half of my life. I was first diagnosed with KERATOCONUS in my late teens. Glasses can't correct my vision due to Keratoconus  and back then my only options were cornea transplants or (RGP) Rigid Gas Permeable lenses.In my early 20's I moved to South Lake Tahoe CA and needed to get a new drivers license. I was unable to pass the vision test for DMV. So I went to a eye doctor and  was diagnosed for a 2nd time. The doctor was in shock I was even able to drive to his office. I told him I needed to be able to pass a vision test to get a drivers license. He fitted me for RGP contact lenses that were so painful to wear  it felt like shards of glass were in my eyes. I was able to use them long enough to pass the vision test to get my CA drivers license. Since I was never able to get used to the RGP lenses  the doctor advised I stop wearing them and look into cornea transplants. The thought of transplants with a risk of not working and losing sight completely  Freaked me out! So i did nothing and have been struggling ever since. Fast forward to now and the time has come that I need to be able to see! Technology has advanced so much that now I have a option for non-invasive procedures that will stop my degenerative eye disease and correct my vision so that I can see clearly  basically for the 1st time in my life. I'll be 40yrs old in March and my drivers license expires and DMV is making me go in for a vision test. I will not be able to pass and continue to drive without getting my eyes fixed.So What Is Keratoconus?It's a progressive corneal eye disease  it thins the cornea and forms it into a cone-like shape. Keratoconus is a degenerative condition  left untreated can result in the cornea bulging out so far the back layer of the cornea can rip open and the internal eye liquid rushes in and swells up the cornea. It will take 3-6 months of non-usable vision until fluid goes away. The cornea then will have a lot of new scarring and vision will be permanently worse. Also left untreated can result in only option being a painful invasive cornea transplant surgery.Some symptoms are:  Blurred & Double vision/ Sensitivity to light/ Glares & Halos/ Progressive nearsightedness/ Poor night visionI need 2 procedures done on both of my eyes. The 1st is called Holcomb C3-R Crosslinking  which will stabilize the Keratoconus from getting worse. It has a 99.3% success rate. The 2nd procedure is call Intacs. Intacs are tiny  clear  semi-circle inserts which will be placed in the peripheral layer of the cornea. Intacs reshape the curvature of the cornea from within. The cornea flattens which helps achieve more clear vision  less distortion  glares  double vision  and improved night vision. We'll have travel expenses as well due to we will have to travel to Southern California for a 3 day visit with the Ophthalmologist.Unfortunately this life changing procedure isn't FDA approved  which means health insurance doesn't cover it. So this is why we are putting our pride to the side and reaching out for helping hands to assist us with financial help. Its very scary to think in order for me to halt the progression of my eye disease and truly see how beautiful the world is for the 1st time  we'll have to go into financial debt.Thank you for taking the time to read my story and any amount is helpful and greatly appreciated!Much Love April  Sebastian & KannonThe Combes Family"

Various tests and scans confirm that the cancer has spread from Renee's lungs to her lymph nodes within the upper chest as well as lymph nodes near the collar bone  neck  and armpit. Fortunately  there is no sign of cancer on her major organs or brain. A rare ROS1 gene mutation (found in 1-2% of lung cancer patients) was identified meaning Renee will receive targeted treatment. On the down side  she still has to fight cancer. Not only is it a physical and mental battle  but it's a financial one as well. Lung cancer is still one of the most expensive cancers to treat. Even with good health insurance  treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy come with financial concern and unexpected costs. Our family would like to be financially prepared for medical expenses to help us focus on increasing and maintaining Renee's quality of life while fighting the war against lung cancer.Please donate today to help Renee!BACKGROUNDRenee  remarried for 23 years  mother of two and grandmother of one  worked in sales and marketing for years and decided to change careers and work with adults with disabilities. As a program coordinator in charge of 20 staff members and 60 participants  her goal is to empower persons with developmental disabilities to achieve greater self-sufficiency and lead richer lives. In mid-September Renee felt two bumps on her collar bone and thought they might go away. They didn't. In early-October she went in for a biopsy and received the news that she had lung cancer which had spread to her lymph nodes. Being a non-smoker  the news was a complete shock to us all. Even though there is a long road ahead  Renee is filled with great optimism and strength and is supported by many during this time.DIAGNOSIS: SCANS AND TESTSRenee had a biopsy  blood work  PET scan  MRI scan  genomic test  confirmatory FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) test  and EKG done before starting treatment.TREATMENTRenee will be on a ROS1 targeted treatment called Xalkori (crizotinib)  a chemotherapy pill.CURRENT CONDITIONRenee is fortunately healthy enough to walk  breathe  and function without too much pain.

She has dedicated her life to helping others by becoming a nurse. Mel was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. This is not her first time down this road. As a teenager  Mel survived an aggressive tumor requiring radiation and surgery and a melanoma a few years ago. Despite this  Mel is still her funny  weird  upbeat self and powering through this.Mel and her care team are optimistic about her prognosis  but her path to healing will be a long and arduous one.  The doctors believe the tumor is benign  but the only way to know is to have the surgery. Treatment involves brain surgery to remove the tumor. Her skull will have to be reconstructed and she'll spend several days in the Neurological ICU before being able to go home. Surgery is just the beginning of a long road to healing. She won’t be able to drive/bike or be left alone for several weeks after the procedure. This is going to be really tough because Mel is active and busy and constantly on the go. She is also fiercely independent and is usually the one taking care of other people. She’s not used to asking for help  but she needs it so we are circling the wagons and asking for your help and support. Although Mel has health insurance  it won’t cover all her medical expenses. We’re raising these funds to help Mel cover additional expenses outside of surgery and supplement her income as she goes through surgery and recovery.Please help in any way that you can. Any amount will be a tremendous gift during this time. If you can’t donate  please share with your network and those who know and love Mely. She will also be in need of rides and company during her recovery.Here's Mel in her own words:“Family/Friends I apologize if I haven’t reached out to you directly  but this process has been logistically  physically  mentally  and emotionally exhausting.I was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. I am sure many of you  like myself  have a multitude of questions. Much at this point is unknown  and it is likely the answers to many questions will remain unknown until I complete the healing process. I do know that this type of brain tumor is usually benign (non-cancerous) and that imaging shows no additional tumors in my brain stem or spine.  Based on my symptoms my tumor removal is non-emergent  but the tumor is sizable so the longer I wait the larger it grows  the older I get the harder my recovery  and the greater I run the risk of developing more serious symptoms. Treatment is a frontotemporal craniotomy for total tumor resection. This involves removing a portion of my skull to cut out the tumor. My skull will then be reconstructed (I do not know what that entails). Due to vascular involvement  I MAY have an additional neurovascular procedure (this will require meeting with another surgeon). I will spend several days in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit before being discharged home. I will not be able to drive/bike or be left alone for several weeks due to potential complications related to my procedure.I am sure some of you have additional questions and/or will want to reach out to me. I ask that you refrain from asking me specifics about my tumor or my surgery. While I feel the love in these questions  answering them repeatedly puts my illness at the forefront of my mind and inhibits my ability to focus on the more positive aspects of my life. It is also disheartening to continuously be asked questions I do not have the answers to. If you would like to reach out to see how I am doing  I ask that you e-mail me  as many texts (while sent with the best intentions) can be daunting. Despite this unfortunate diagnosis  I am my usual goofy self. It’s going to take a lot more than a brain tumor to derail this happy train!For my birthday I am hoping you could help me raise money to pay for my medical expenses. For those of you who cannot give money  the gift of your time is appreciated when I need company during the recovery process. Additionally  if anyone knows any brain tumor survivors I could speak with I would be grateful if you could connect us.With love and gratitude Mel\"THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION"

Soy un productor audiovisual de 48 años de Caracas  Venezuela. Hace aproximadamente un mes y medio sufrí un ataque al corazón y me encontré en un estado crítico. La situación económica en mi país (Venezuela) me hizo imposible cubrir los costos relacionados con el tratamiento de emergencia que tuve que someterme. No tenía más remedio que confiar en amigos y familiares para cubrir estos costos médicos.¿Cómo comenzó todo?Sentí dolor de pecho agudo el pasado 21 de noviembre mientras caminaba desde el campus de la universidad hasta la estación de metro. Había empezado a sentirme mal mientras estaba sentado en clase escuchando detonaciones y represión estatal contra la manifestación de estudiantes fuera del edificio de la universidad. Decidí irme a casa cuando me di cuenta de que me sentía mal. A pesar del dolor  logré continuar mi camino a casa usando el transporte público  luchando para no desmayarme. Ya me había desmayado brevemente en el metro unos días antes  lo cual fue particularmente aterrador dada la falta de seguridad en Venezuela (temía que me robaran o me dejaran sin ningún tipo de apoyo de emergencia. Afortunadamente  logré llegar a casa ese día.Los síntomas empeoraron. Mi esposa y yo decidimos que tenía que obtener atención primaria a través del seguro privado que tengo  solo para poder revisarme. Los paramédicos determinaron que tenía que ir a una clínica (no cubierta por el seguro) para realizar todas las pruebas (por ejemplo  ECG) necesarias para verificar si estaba pasando por un ataque cardíaco o no. Efectivamente  tan pronto como me conecté a la máquina de ECG de la clínica  el equipo de emergencia confirmó que estaba sufriendo un ataque al corazón. ¿Qué hay que hacer? Un cateterismo cardíaco y la colocación de una endoprótesis en mi corazón para abrir la obstrucción de la arteria coronaria.¿Cuáles fueron los costos?Como usted bien sabe  Venezuela está pasando por una de las peores hiperinflaciones de la región y del mundo (la inflación ha superado el 1 millón por ciento anual). Por esa razón  mi seguro de salud se ha convertido en algo insignificante. ¡Cubre menos de un dólar! Sin embargo  el costo total de mi estadía y tratamiento en el hospital costó $ 6 500  que tuvimos que pedir prestados a familiares y amigos. Les estoy profundamente agradecido por su generosidad y ahora tengo que pagarles por su apoyo en un momento tan difícil. Además  tengo que adquirir un seguro de salud en dólares a partir de ahora. En este momento  la cobertura de salud que necesito tiene un valor de 500 US $.Actualmente estoy en la fase de recuperación. Estoy asistiendo a chequeos médicos y haciendo diferentes exámenes.Como productor audiovisual mi trabajo no garantiza un salario mensual estable. Lo que gano por proyecto no es suficiente para cubrir mi deuda o adquirir la cobertura de salud adecuada. Por eso decidí apelar a la buena fe de esta gran comunidad para pagar mi deuda y adquirir un seguro de salud basado en el dólar. La ayuda total que busco es de 7.000 US $.Sé que muchas personas lo apoyan  pero no pueden ayudarlo financieramente  hay muchos venezolanos que atraviesan tiempos difíciles  por lo que les pido que me ayuden a difundir esta campaña lo más lejos posible. Cada poquito ayuda.Dios los bendiga a todos Tomás GodoyP.S: Esta campaña es administrada por mi Amiga  María Alejandra Morillo  quien recibirá los fondos en mi nombre  ya que no tengo una cuenta en el extranjero.Hi! My name is Tomás. I am a 48 years old audiovisual producer from Caracas  Venezuela. About a month and a half ago I suffered a heart attack and found myself in a critical state. The economic situation in my country (Venezuela) made it impossible for me to cover the costs involved in dealing with the emergency treatment I had to undergo.  I had no option but to rely on friends and relatives in order to cover these medical costs. How did it all begin?            I felt acute chest pain last November 21 while walking from the university campus to the subway station. I had begun to feel ill while sitting in class listening to detonations and state repression against student's demonstration outside the university building. I decided to go home when I realized I was feeling unwell.  Despite the pain  I managed to continue my way home using public transport  struggling not to faint. I had already fainted briefly in the subway a few days before  which was particularly scary given the lack of security in Venezuela (I feared being robbed or left without any emergency support. Fortunately  I managed to get home that day. Symptoms worsened. My wife and I decided that I had to get primary care through the private insurance I have  just so I could be checked. Paramedics determined that I had to go to a clinic (not covered by insurance) to do all tests (e.g. ECG) required in order to check whether or not I was going through a heart attack. Sure enough  as soon as I was connected to the Clinic's ECG machine the emergency team confirmed I was going through a heart attack. What needed to be done? a cardiac catheterization and placement of a stend in my heart in order to open the obstruction of the Coronary artery.What were the costs?            As you may well know  Venezuela is currently going through one of the worst hyperinflations of the region and the world (inflation has surpassed 1 million percent annually). For that reason  my health insurance has become rather insignificant. It covers less than a dollar! However  the total cost of my stay and treatment in the hospital cost 6 500 US$  which we had to borrow from family and friends. I am deeply thankful to them for their generosity and now have to pay them back for their support during such a difficult time. In addition  I need to acquire a dollar-denominated health insurance from now on. At the moment the health coverage I require is worth 500 US$. I am currently in the recovery phase. I am attending medical checkups and doing different tests. As an audiovisual producer my work does not guarantee a stable monthly salary. What I earn per project is not enough to cover my debt or acquire appropriate health coverage. That is why I decided to appeal to the good faith of this great community in order to pay my debt and acquire a dollar-based health insurance. The total help I seek is 7 000 US$I know many people are supportive but cannot help financially  there are many Venezuelans going through tough times so I ask you help me spread this campaign as far and wide as possible. Every little bit helps.God bless you all             Tomás"

At this time he is waiting for the bone scan & ct chest scan to be done so they can make sure that the cancer has not spread. After that he  will start chemo and other procedures depending on the results of the tests. At this time he is out of work and his disability insurance has not started yet so the bills are piling up and his medications are very expensive. His health insurance has a very high deductible and he has to pay $12000 out of pocket per year before insurance will start paying their share  even then not all of his prescriptions  will be covered. I am trying to raise $30000 to cover this year's and next year's deductibles and help to cover the cost of medication. Roger has helped his family and friends whenever needed. He is a great son  brother  father  grandfather  uncle and friend. He is very grateful to have a strong emotional support system but cancer comes with unforeseen expenses and hardships that I would like to help him cope with.Roger is not the type to ask others for help but I would like to make sure he has the financial support and resources to fight this. I want  to make the medical costs and financial burdens less of a concern for him   since this should not be what he is worrying about now.Please  any donation no matter how small will help. It would also help if you could share this page on facebook or twitter.  Thank you. I will be posting regular updates and let everyone  know how things are going as we get more information.Please note- on the donation page  there is a section in which you can make a donation to GoFundMe.

Right after she was diagnosed in June  she had a scan that showed the inoperable tumor took up her whole stomach. She had been unable to eat due to this and had dropped to 102 lbs. A J-tube (into the jejunum) was placed for the nutrition. She has done very well with it and now weighs 121; her usual weight is 125-130. She's been having chemo too  of course. The nutrition comes in 8 oz cartons and Peggy uses 5 a day. It goes into a bag that's attached to the tube. Peggy had been ordering this on a monthly basis. Every statement says \"patient responsibility $0.00.\" When she went to reorder on Dec. 28  she was told that the charge was $2100/month and she owed for back charges of over $12 000. (They later said they could charge her $600/month.) When Peggy was trying to pursue what had happened she was told that \"food\" was not covered  and the nutrition is \"food.\" We understand that Wellmark  Medicare  Medicaid  and the United Community Plan all cover the liquid nutrition. It should be covered. It's necessary for life. Legislation is needed requiring health insurance companies to cover medically necessary nutrition. Peggy's family and spouse Beth are in need of assistance to catch up on these bills that were placed in their lap. Their family realizes that these bills wont stop anytime soon but anything is helpful.Please help donate to help their family. If you can't donate please pass on this campaign and shed light onto their situation. Thanks!"

Shannon’s strength  resilience  and sense of humor is beyond measure. And even though she would never ask for it  right now she needs our help.In late September Shannon was admitted to the hospital after dealing with constant nausea  vomiting  mysterious bruising and acute pain for weeks. They diagnosed her with a serious pyelo infection (severe infection in the kidneys) and aggressively treated her with IV antibiotics through a pic line.Once discharged  most of her symptoms continued even after the infection had cleared. The last few months have been filled with dozens upon dozens of tests  procedures  and medications.After further testing she has been diagnosed with a yet to be determined autoimmune disease  that is attacking her central nervous system. One of her most prominent symptoms has been her inability to eat solid foods and process protein. Doctors believe she has a motility disorder  where part of her stomach and/or intestines may be experiencing paralysis or nerve damage.With the hospital stay  on-going visits with specialists  weekly lab work  and constant testing the medical bills are mounting. Thankfully she has health insurance for the first time in years but even with that she currently owes $7000+ and she has not yet been fully diagnosed!Shannon is one of the best.

"Medical","November 20, 2018","Heath Shelton - Faith Fighting Cancer","$4,660","$20,000","38","4","38","484","GUTHRIE","OK","THE TRUTHI've never been a fan of online fundraising. Or  really  ANY fundraising.There  I said it.However  I understand its necessity and have supported several over the years. I NEVER thought I'd organize one for my family. It is a hard thing to decide to do. It is humbling. It requires swallowing your pride. It took a glaring-in-the-mirror pep talk. But here I am.THE REASONHeath  my husband of 22 yrs  has been diagnosed with melanoma. Yes  it's ONLY skin cancer (please  if you don't want a hysterical crazy-lady on your hands  don't say that to my face). It's a rapidly spreading  nasty cancer that can easily grow. Then easily infects other areas. Then can become other nasty cancers. His is very deep  very aggressive and located on his face.THE DOCTORSAt this point  Heath has seen a dermatologist  general surgeon and plastic surgeon.  A general surgery is scheduled for Dec 4 to remove a large section of tissue. Prior to surgery  a dye will be inserted into his lymph nodes in his neck to determine if the cancer has already spread to that area. The likelihood of this is estimated very high from the biopsy that has already been done. If there are infected lymph nodes  they will also be removed during surgery.      Best-case scenario: No infected lymph nodes. Only remove facial     tissue that is infected. Then follow with plastic surgery and recovery.     A predicable course of future follow up to remain cancer-free!     Scary-case scenario: Cancer has entered the lymphatic system.      Still follow with the plastic surgeon to repair his face but will also      require a follow up with an oncologist and likely radiation and/or      chemo treatments. Lots of unknown factors!I want to be very clear on a few points. 1) The plastic surgery is NOT optional. It is REQUIRED by the general surgeon. It is NOT cosmetic. It's necessary to maintain the ability to use his mouth and prevent drooping of his eye (see picture in the first comment posted).2) We do not know what the future holds. We only have the information we have been given and it can all change at any point. THE WHYMost of you likely know  we are self-employeed. Heath has had a photography studio for over 20 years. His passion. His dream. The only thing he has ever wanted to do. And he's good at it. REALLY good.  He loves capturing the most beautiful moments of people's lives so they can be cherished forever. However  as a result  he does not have health insurance. That usually isn't an issue because he's basically a healthy guy. Unfortunately  it IS an issue now. This is already expensive and we are only at the beginning. THE MONEY We want to be honest & upfront with how your money will be used if you decide to help us out. A payment of $1 500 is required prior to the general surgery. That means  IMMEDIATELY. The remainder is put on a payment plan. There will be another fee for the pastic surgery which should follow approximately 5 days after the first.  Then for the next year there are required follow up office visits with all three doctors mentioned. Currently  we estimate the medical expenses at an initial $10 000 for the BEST CASE SCENARIO. Here's a current breakdown:$215        Initial dermatologist consult & biopsy$125        Initial surgeon consult$110        Initial plastic surgeon consult$2700     General surgery estimated charges$3000     Plastic surgery estimated charges$700        Tissue testing$350        Follow up visits for 1 year$200        Travel expenses $2400      Living allowance for 1 month from loss of ability to work$10 000  Current NeedWe recognize there are likely things we have overlooked or underestimated. This is new unfamiliar territory for us.  Obviously  there will be a much greater need if we are faced with a different scenario. We have launched this GoFundMe with a $20 000 goal with that in mind. THE FAITHIt's hard to ask for help. It's uncomfortable to feel vulnerable. If you know us at all  then you know WE LOVE JESUS. Sometimes being faithful is uncomfortable too. Many times it was in hard times that the people of the Bible asked for Jesus' help. However  it was never  not once  hard for Jesus to extend His love  healing and deliverance. We KNOW our God is bigger than cancer. Mightier than the unknown. Constant in His loving peace.The word 'promises' appears 24 times in the NIV Bible and SIX of those guarantee that His promises are true and never fail. THE PRAYERThe greatest gift of friendship is prayer. Please pray for:• This journey Heath has begun • Reassurance for our three amazing children and their many questions• Provision for all of our needs• Total  complete and unquestionable healingWe covet your prayers and if you feel lead  please donate financially also. We sincerely appreciate your help!Thank you for taking the time to read our story.Much love to each of you!"
"Medical","November 27, 2018","Back on her feet","$4,660","$20,000","33","4","33","49","MIAMI","FL","Thank you for stopping by our page and taking a minute or two to read our story.  We are not the type of people to begin a Go Fund Me support page  but this is an emergency that is as simple making sure one has a roof over their head to live under  but as financially challenging to one who has been struggling to not financially drown for two years. It's a heartfelt and truthful story  with an unexpected medical miracle  but one that we trust that God will pull us all through.Here is the short story:In Jan 2016  my dad was diagnosed with a cancer that was supposed to be \"easy to mange\" as stated by the doctors  but it ended up taking his life now in october 2018. In july  he was told he had 2 months left to live  so Nancy and I got married  but then he got better in some sort of a temporary miracle  but then he got really bad again late sept eraly oct of this year and he passed away. Unfortunately the job he had did not provide retirment options and his life insurace was taken away sometime in 2017  so now my mom is stuck with all the bills and the mortgage on a house and she makes a little over $1k per month and can't afford to go find an appartment for her  my sister  and her parents to live in on that income. We still believe God can perform miracles! Here is the whole story:“God is faithful  and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with your testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it” (1 Corinthians 10:13). This is a verse that we are struggling to hang onto  but we trust that it will come true.Throughout our life  Luis and Ani Cavada put their household first  and they did things that were tough for them  but best for the family. Some of the activities they enjoyed doing were family dinners  just walking around the malls together  Luis would golf with his son on the weekends to help him build on his professional networking skills when he didn't work  and they liked to travel together. Their son Andres would travel with his father on business trips occasionally to learn more about what his father did  which is what inspired Andres to become an engineer just like his father. Luis and Ani also did their best to ensure their children had a great Christian education to ensure they had the bed chances at college possible. With this passion of keeping the home together and doing things  Luis did have some sacrifices to do. He would travel to China for two or three months per year for many years  or he also sacrificed by moving himself to Virginia for work when his job in Miramar moved to another state to ensure that his family could continue to grow and strengthen without interruption. Being away from his family so long really hit Luis hard  and whenever he returned back home  it was always in tears of joy from missing his us so much. There was nothing that Luis wouldn't do for us.On a day that Luis was returning back to Miami (at the time he was commuting to and from Virginia for weeks at a time to continue working)  Luis was stricken with intense back pains. To the point of making it difficult to walk. That same day he was flying back home so he did not want to be hospitalized in Virginia so he flew down to Miami and was admitted at Baptist Hospital. After a few days of tests  they admit him into the Oncology floor  with theories of him having cancer  but no final results. Finally  one night in January of 2016  we got some answers  but they weren't what we wanted to hear: he had cancer and was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. As any normal human would do  we all were stricken with grief  worry  anxiety  and sadness  but there was one person who held their head up high: Luis. He grabbed his family  looked us all firmly in the eyes and said \"It's going to be ok  we'll get through this together\". At this moment  we realized that God is in control  He always has been  always will be  and this is what Luis was conveying to us.Now  this cancer is not a commonly heard of cancer like colon or breast cancer. You have a 0.76% chance of getting this cancer ( https://www.cancer.org/cancer/multiple-myeloma/about/key-statistics.html)  and unfortunately Luis happened to be a part of that extremely small statistic  something that him nor his family ever thought would strike. Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of one's plasma cells  which are made in the bone marrow. With this cancer  the plasma cells become cancerous and they grow out of control going everywhere in one's body  which could cause issues with the blood counts (this could include platelets  red blood cells  and white blood cells)  weak bones  increased risk of infections  and potential kidney damage.For two years  with God's strength  Luis battled this cancer. He fought with all of the nasty repercussions of doing chemo and radiation (a few tumors arose)  side effects of the narcotics he had to take to numb the pain  side effects of coming off of taking these narcotics  and at some times  he struggled to do things on his own due to all the medications he was one. When he was first diagnosed  him and his family were also hit with the terrible news that his health insurance DID NOT COVER CANCER. At the time he was diagnosed  he was working for a contracting company that the only health insurance plan they offered did not provide cancer coverage. This was another significant battle that God was able to eventually pull him through. Baptist hospital was able to help out in the beginning to get his treatments going while he searched for new medical coverage.Finally  Luis is able to locate health coverage  but at a significant cost of around $800 per month which put an additional financial stress on his family. The financial issues did not stop though  deductibles for the procedures were high  deductibles for his medicine were high  and his disability that he was on (which we are extremely grateful for) only paid him half of the yearly salary he used to make. These financial struggles little by little strangled Luis and Ani. Luis had to take money out of his retirement just to financially survive  and also take out money from his life insurance. After a year of being on his disability  his life insurance policy was also taken from him due to being on disability for too long  and little by little  all the investments in savings and retirement were slowly being drained out of him. Money was not something easy to come by anymore  so more sacrifices had to be made.At that time  Ani's parents were living in an efficiency within that house  but the financial situation was so great  that they needed to rent out that efficiency to provide some sort of financial relief. God has put some great family members in our lives that were able to trust Luis and Ani by loaning them money and helping them find people that would build a new bedroom in the living room for Ani's parents to live in while the efficiency was rented out.Fast forward to July 2018  a new chemo procedure is performed on Luis  some bone marrows samples are pulled from him  and a sentence that no family member looks forward to hearing is spoken: Luis  you have two months left to live.This turns our lives upside down. He is too young! He has so much more potential in life! He has been fighting for so long! Ani will grow old and alone! He hasn't experienced the blessing of having grandkids! How can his own parents outlive their son! It shouldn't be like this  it's not fair! These were our emotions  we are human  and we are imperfect. Yet in all of this  there was still some peace. A peace that passes all understanding. The peace given to us by God. We asked God for peace  and we were given the peace. (Philippians 4:6-7). At this point  his son Andres was engaged to his girlfriend of 5 years  and they moved their wedding from November 2018 to a few days later from being given that news. This happened because of two things: 1. God's heavenly support2. The blessing that is Baptist Hospital  they were the biggest earthly help Nancy or Andres could have asked forOn July 28th  2018  Luis was able to see his son get married and for a moment  we all forgot about our dad's terminal news.A week or two later after the wedding  Luis is discharged to go home to leave this earth in the most amount of comfort possible: his home with his family. Through the grace of God  Luis begins to actually feel better! It's a miracle! This new procedure is finally taking an effect against his cancer. God's plan is seeming to be that He still does miracles  and Luis could potentially be a living testimony. His oncology doctor was even shocked and told him to prepare for a new procedure to be performed in early October  after he had said that there was nothing else he could medically do without significantly impacting his quality of life (at this point  the cancer had reached his spinal fluid and there were not medical treatments with success to treat his cancer there). Yet good news doesn't always stick around for too long though because God has something else planned.Towards the end of September 2018  Luis' health starts to go down again  and fast. He gets admitted into the hospital and they do multiple tests. It turns out one of his tumors has returned  a new tumor in his brain has grown  and the cancer is back and stronger than before. Luis is told this is the last time he would be in a hospital  and is sent home to live his final days at peace with his family. October 13th  2018  five days after he was supposed to get the second treatment  Luis departs from his family and has gone to be with the Lord. In his time of battling the cancer  we believe his faith grew  and his relationship with God was indeed strengthened. Now Ani is left to grow old by herself  and now has to find a way to financially survive.When we started to evaluate all the finances  it was clear as day that Ani does not make enough money to continue to pay the mortgage of the house nor make enough money to live in a smaller apartment with her parents. Even with the social security money from her parents was not enough to survive  so the decision to rent out the house was agreed upon. Yet  this house is not in the rental conditions it should be in. Due to the extremely tight financial situations  the home has not been able to be properly up kept. When the hurricane  passed through south Florida in 2017  they cause some damages to the home that have yet to be fixed due to Ani and Luis doing whatever they could to financially stay afloat. The situation is the following: due to the financial circumstances Luis and Ani were in for two years  Ani needs to rent her home for her  her daughter  and her parents to keep a roof over their heads. The amount we are asking for is nothing crazy  but for someone who had their husband pass away who had to use all of his savings and retirement for the family to survive  left Ani with no financial support to be able to tackle this burden on her own. This is the reality we live in  but it's one that we are doing our best to trust the God will make a way for Ani and her parents.It was never considered to create this page when Luis first passed away because the above mentioned solution seemed to be simple  but the financial obstacles do not stop for Ani  and here we are. We pray to God that He would bless you and move in you to help Ani  her daughter  and her grandparents pay for the home repairs that need to be done  so they can stay with a roof over their heads. During Luis' time battling cancer  we knew God could perform a miracle  and we still do.Thank you for your time  and may God bless you no matter what you decide to do after reading this."

What happened:  Heather was recently bartending at Westport Flea Market and  because of how terrible their back rooms are set up  ergonomically speaking  she injured herself on the job. Her employer has been AWFUL about this at every step and is fighting her claim for worker's comp   saying that she hurt herself \"playing guitar\"  which is total BS.  Her attorney is not being responsive and she is stuck with him.  She was scheduled for surgery on Friday  January 25  but St. Luke's requires a 25% down payment on her $78 000 surgery. The injury: she has two torn discs in her neck that are oozing  and vertebrae that are crushed and protruding.  More than two months after the injury  her spinal cord is being affected  and she is suffering neurological damage  including reflex issues  numbness  and *severe* pain.The surgery: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion  which includes replacing her damaged discs with cadaver discs (which  admittedly  is pretty badass) and hardware. The plea: Heather needs your help to pay for this surgery.  It's not clear that her employer will ever be held liable  and if they are  she will suffer for who-knows-how-long in the meantime.  The surgery itself costs $78 000 but the goal of this fundraiser is just the bare minimum cost to make the surgery happen.  $19 000 (the 25% down payment).  That's a lot of dough  but it is my hope that enough folks in the punk rock community and beyond will help her out as best as you can.  We thank you in advance for even reading this plea and considering it.  <3"

In less than a month from now  her mortgage company is going to try to take her house from her. She needs your help.HOW DO I HELP? Donate if you can. If not  Linda is a landscaper (who  due to her current condition  now mostly works Chicago's Northwest side). If you're interested in hiring her  just call Linda's Lawn Care at (773) 507-5296. Or tell your family and friends to hire her!WHY SHOULD I HELP? My mother has always been a fighter. When her marriage ended in a difficult divorce  she built a successful landscaping business that has been her primary source of income for over 20 years. She has always had an aversion to asking for help  preferring to work for everything she has. As a single mother  she raised me  my disabled brother  and our baby sister all while working 6 - 7 days a week. During loan modification negotiations with her mortgage company… she fell ill. What she thought was an aggressive sinus infection  coupled with pinkeye  was actually an acute  closed angle glaucoma attack. Lacking quality health insurance  it was weeks before she could get treatment; someone finally told her to go to Cook County hospital  where she learned the severity of the situation. At only 58  it was unexpected  to say the least. She was also diagnosed with diabetes (now controlled)  hypertension  and suffered at least one minor stroke in the following months  due to the stress of her conditions. Given her illness and the subsequent recovery  she missed deadlines and her mortgage company began foreclosure proceedings on her home. We were informed of the judgment of foreclosure just before Christmas  and are currently in the “redemption period” with the sale date weeks away  as the mortgage company is reviewing all the documents we have submitted. She's endured her fair share of hardships: the long recovery process  and trying to use her other senses to aid her low vision while workingWHAT IF I DO HELP? As she catches up with bills and we wait for the landscaping season to start up again  we're trying to raise $15 000.This amount will help cover medical needs  can help with a few mortgage payments  and would be put towards other unexpected expenses (like truck repairs). With this money  the mortgage company may agree to a loan modification so my mother won’t lose her home of 33 years; she can continue to be as autonomous as possible despite her stretch of bad health  being more than capable to tackle the spring season. Please remember  every little bit helps  whether it's a donation  or a landscaping job. I’m infinitely grateful for all help we receive  and I know my mother will be even more so. Thank you. If you wish to know even more details  I have posted her story on Facebook as #LindaTheLandscaper which will be the hashtag going forward. Again  thank you.Even during some of our many hospital trips  we can make her smile"

Six weeks after I had my daughter I was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had to have emergency surgery to have it removed. Since it was on my brain stem the doctor was not able to remove ALL of the tumor. Due to the massive amount of steroids I had to take to control the brain swelling  I ended up getting Avascular Necrosis and needing a left hip and shoulder replacement.      Over the past 5 years I have undergone 17 craniotomies in order to implant 2 shunts in my head as well as remove the tumor. After my last craniotomy in July  I was diagnosed with 2 blood clots in my lungs. Due to the size of one of the blood clots I am now in right sided heart failure as well. I'm currently on oxygen and require a walker to help me get around and to conserve my energy because my heart rate rises quickly when I exert myself.      I have worked as a 2nd grade teacher for the past 8 years  even while going through these issues.

(I am probably forgetting some of my issues because I get \"foggy brain\" along with everything else.)Prior to February 2018  I was under the impression that I was healthy and we were a 2-income household. Now I am bedridden most of the time and too sick to work. We have made it this long because we have downsized  used every RX discount available  I had short term disability thru my prior employer and my husband had an Aflac policy. We have cut every corner we can think of but unfortunately  there are no more corners left to cut.  Asking for help and doing a \"Go Fund Me\" is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do but I do not know what else to do. Almost a year later and I am still soooooooooo sick and need prescriptions  have specialist appointments and need treatments. I never in a million years would have thought that almost a year later I would still be so sick and bedridden most of the time. My health insurance is over $800 a month. I have 5 doctors/specialists that I need to see on a regular basis  take over 15 very necessary prescriptions (blood thinners  anti rejections  steroids  SLE meds  etc.) and self-injections. The co-pays  treatments and deductibles have been difficult to cover  but they are about to be impossible to cover. Despite the very aggressive medications & treatments that I currently take my health continues to deteriorate. My rheumatologist recently ordered chemotherapy treatments in hopes of giving me some quality of life back and getting my symptoms under control. Unfortunately  my health insurance company denied her request. They have mandated that in addition to my current prescriptions  treatments and self-injections that I must take an additional 2 self-injections for 12 weeks before they will approve the chemotherapy treatments. Of course  all these medications have very harsh side effects. This is on top of the disease's relentless symptoms. My body is attacking itself. I feel like I have been poisoned and I am in constant and relentless pain 24/7. I have been a fighter my whole life  but this disease shuts my body down. My muscles start to burn and no matter how hard I tell my brain to keep going my muscles start to burn and then they freeze up. I have literally cried  screamed and yelled with determination trying to push thru the pain but my body locks up. No matter how hard I try pushing thru is not an option. The autoimmune issues/diseases have robbed me of being a mom/wife  my health  my independence  my job  bring me unbearable pain  affect my thinking  my motor skills and have completely altered my physical appearance. Because of the long term high doses of steroids  I have developed Cushing's disease. I don't recognize the person that looks back at me in the mirror. (The cover picture was taken 4/2018 at Shand's Hospital when I was recovering from emergency open heart surgery  which was the result of my body attacking my organs. Since 4/2018 my appearance has changed drastically. Even though I am so ashamed of how I look in the pictures below I felt like I needed to share just how much autoimmune has physically changed me over this past year)Fortunately  I have the support of my 2 absolutely amazing sons and my husband. They have been so supportive during this difficult time and have done everything they can to try to nurse me back to health and help in any way that they can. Logically  I know I shouldn't feel guilty but I do. I would do anything to be a mom and wife again. To be their caretaker instead of them taking care of me. I hope and pray every day that any of my medications and/or treatments will start to restore my health  but if I can't afford them anyways then there isn't much hope of my health improving at all. This my sole motivation for doing this. Thank you for taking the time to read a little about my story. It is very difficult to try to condense everything that has happened since 2/2018 but I hope I have given some insight into the trials and tribulations that we have faced during this last year. Even if you decide you'd rather not help I hope you take one thing from all this  please listen to your body and take time to care for yourself. I look back now and think how did I miss this? My body was all but screaming at me! But when you are busy living life you just keep pushing and just keep going. Please know that if you don't listen to your body you could end up like me  40 years old  chronically ill and having to ask for help just to try to fight for your health.   My amazing boys. They have been so strong and helpful throughout all this. Picture of the muscles on my left side locking up and locking down and showing the fluid retention that shifts throughout my body. My joints and muscles will swell and are warm to the touch.

Although she fought relentlessly to overcome the cancer and come out on top  her victory was short lived. In December of this year Lucinda was informed her cancer had returned -- this time in the form of stage 4 cancer attacking her brain and bones. Adding to Lucinda's considerable pain and grief  her loving husband  Chuck  unexpectedly passed away on Christmas Eve. Chuck and Lucinda were married for 20+years and have 3 beautiful children together. Since Lucinda was unable to work due to the aggressive cancer treatment  Chuck was the sole provider of both income and health insurance.  With Chuck gone  Lucinda is left to grieve her own loss as well as helping their children through this difficult time -- all while still going through debilitating cancer treatment. We ask that if you are able to donate please do so  there is no amount too small. If you cannot donate but would like to help in other ways (food  etc.)  please email me.  Your thoughts and prayers are also needed and greatly appreciated for this grieving family.

It's really hard to ask for help. You know how when people try to say something isn't hard they say \"it's not brain surgery\"? Well. This is definitely  literally brain surgery. Turns out it's actually pretty hard. Here's a description from Justine of what is going on at the moment: \"Over the last year (and probably much longer) I've been experiencing a variety of symptoms including headaches  cognitive issues like memory problems and forgetting words  progressive pain  numbness  and tingling in different parts of my body  dizziness  trouble swallowing  and host of other symptoms. In trying to figure out why all of this has been happening  I spent the last year going to five doctors and having lots of different medical tests done. Over that year the symptoms have gotten progressively worse  with headaches lasting days  and neurological symptoms becoming more frequent and severe. I’ve finally been diagnosed with a condition called a Chiari Malformation  which basically means my brain is just a little bit too big for my skull and it’s getting squished. The only treatment for this condition is brain surgery. So right now  that’s what I’m preparing for.I have a surgical consultation on 1/21 to go over the finer details of my treatment plan and put the surgery on the books.\" Justine is lucky enough to have good health insurance  but even so there many expenses involved in her treatment  such as:*Her outstanding medical bills from the long road to diagnosis*Her copays for tens of thousands of dollars in surgery  procedures and medications*She'll probably need to take some unpaid time off of work during her recovery.  She'll need to be able to pay bills  rent  etc during this time.*She will need physical support during her recovery time  which may require her to travel to be near her family  or to hire a home healthcare assistant.Her surgery will be soon (the date is being set January 21)  and the last thing Justine needs is to stress out about money when she should be getting well. Your assistance will help her maintain normalcy in a decidedly abnormal time. Justine would also love your help in the form of:*Assistance with household tasks like cooking  cleaning  shopping  playing with kitties. These tasks are getting more and more exhausting and a hand would be amazing.*Companionship! Come over! Be friends!*Rides to appointments"
"Medical","January 20, 2019","Melissa Brantley&apos;s Cancer Fighting Fund","$4,570","$86,000","50","2","52","115","EDMONDS","WA","As a mother  there's nothing worse than hearing the words  \"you have cancer\" because you know it will be very hard on your children  no matter how old they are or how well you explain it. For a single mom  the worry is compounded with \"who will take care of me when I'm too sick to do anything?\" and \"how will I manage the extreme financial stress?\" The answers to those questions force a person to confront their vulnerability at a time and pace that is unimaginable. This is happening to my dearest friend  Melissa and the hits keep coming. Melissa was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in May 2018. This was one year after a different doctor told her the lump she felt was just bone. I hate to think this was because she didn't have health insurance at the time  but that doesn't really matter now. Melissa is solely focused on fighting for her life. This isn't her first battle with this disease  as she left her home/job in California to take care of both of her parents in Georgia until they both eventually died of cancer. In between her role as full-time caregiver  she was also homeschooling her daughter. She spent YEARS putting everyone else's needs ahead of her own. When she became sick  there was no family left to care for her.  What happens when the caregiver needs to be cared for  but no one is around to do it?! They make plans to manage their own care without blinking an eye. Melissa prepared her home for the really bad days following chemo treatments when she would be too sick to walk to the restroom across the hall by dragging her mattress closer to the bathroom door. She used a wheeled office chair to carry her body into the kitchen so she could eat food directly out of the refrigerator. Thankfully  her wonderful neighbor had organized a schedule of cooked meals donated by neighbors and Melissa's business partner  Conrad  has dutifully taken her to all of her doctor appointments and stayed by her side during several months of chemotherapy. Prior to the chemo  I went to GA to take care of my friend when she had surgery. For ten days  I cared for her and her three dogs rescued from shelters that she loves so much. It was hard for her to be the patient and to let someone else do all the work. Melissa is not comfortable asking for help from anyone  but she trusted me and I am grateful for that trust. As the medical treatment continues with months of radiation ahead  the financial obstacles have become increasingly difficult  if not impossible for Melissa to bear alone. She is self-insured and recently had to change medical plans do to a massive premium increase. This resulted in a need to change providers mid-treatment after it was discovered that she was no longer eligible with the less expensive insurance plan. There was a very costly day of evaluations by specialists  along with medical procedures to prep her for radiation that was not covered at all before she was notified about the limitations of the new insurance carrier. Due to the inoperable location of a tumor in her neck  the need for intense radiation right now is critical! She also has a spot on her lung that the specialist intends to target with radiation. When Melissa came home from that anxiety-filled day that left her feeling more vulnerable than ever  she was hit with the news about the insurance blunder. She doesn't have the time or the energy for this fight on top of everything else.As her friend  I've asked Melissa to trust me once again by reaching out to others through this fundraiser to help her fight this cancer. Please support Melissa  who has been so courageous and positive through this battle with cancer. She has cared for so many others in so many ways. It's her turn to receive care and to experience the kindness of strangers. She is everything that's good in a person; loving  compassionate  generous  creative  smart and incredibly funny. Please share her story with as many people as you can. Help give this selfless woman a chance to beat this disease without worrying about being evicted from her home. No one should have to fight cancer alone. Thank you for listening. Chaunte' KashiwaPost chemo:Melissa  before she met cancer in person:"

Well  the time has come to be discharged (on January 4th) to return home. I’m looking forward to being back with my family and I’m thankful for everyone who has been praying for me as the Lord continues providing me strength on a daily basis. While its certainly good news that I’m going home  it also presents challenges and needs. I require home weekly assistance from nurses  physical/ occupational therapists and also a home health aide.My health insurance policy will only partially cover the nurses/therapists and they will not provide ANY coverage for a home health aide. In order for me to have this needed help it will require us to privately hire an aide which will be 100% out of pocket. Unfortunately  this is not possible for us to do without financial assistance and it’s with this in mind that I decided to humbly share my need with you on this Go Fund Me page.The amount of funds we are able to raise and collectively pull together will determine how many days a week and also for how many weeks I will be able to have an aide come to help me. Having this daily assistance with my needs will also serve an important secondary purpose as it will help to prevent recurrences of contributing factors that initiated my need for hospitalization back in September.Every donation no matter the amount makes a difference and further helps me get the daily assistance I need. I thank you from my heart for any financial support you’re able to give and I am grateful for your continued prayers.Sincerely Stephen"

"Medical","November 4, 2018","Brain surgery/recovery for Melanie","$4,555","$40,000","53","5","53","505","MARYVILLE","MO","PLEASE HELP ME GET THE BRAIN SURGERY I NEED  AND GET MY LIFE BACK!I have always been a very active person with a love for the outdoors. I love art and enjoy photography and painting. I have always enjoyed traveling and going on adventures. I had even booked and paid for a cruise in January of this year  and looked forward to turning 40 years-old in the middle of the ocean on November 29  2018. However  life has other plans for me and I will be having brain surgery instead. My tumor was found on August 15th. I have brain surgery scheduled for December 10th. The Backstory For the last four or five years  I have been struggling with several symptoms; such as fatigue  sleeping issues  heat sensitivity  light sensitivity  pressure headaches  and tremors. In January of 2018  my symptoms began to get worse  and I began to develop new ones  including vision issues  stuttering  getting stuck on words  losing my balance  cognitive issues  emotional outbursts  ice pick headaches  muscle spasms  vertigo  and more. After several blood tests  eye specialists appointments  MRIs  and EEGs  we finally found out what was going on. I have a Pineal Tumor. The PlanDue to the type of tumor  and the location (Geographic center of the brain)  there are only 2 neurosurgeons in the United States that will remove it. Therefore  I will be traveling to Charleston  South Carolina for brain tumor removal surgery with Dr. Patel at MUSC on December 10th. He is the Chair of the Neurosurgery department  and I truly believe I could not be in better hands for this surgery. The CostThe total for the hospital (surgery  anesthesia  hospital stay  etc) will be around $58 000.As of 11/6/18  the hospital is requiring HALF as down payment before surgery. They had originally agreed to $10 000 down  but the supervisors decided the total was too great of a risk so now they want the $29 000 down payment by November 23rd!!!! Down Payment has been PAID!!!! Surgery is definitely happening.I am trying everything I can to get insurance coverage. I had insurance through my job  which i lost in September. I can possibly qualify for insurance through Missouri  however Missouri Medicaid is considered out of network by the hospital in South Carolina and won't be accepted as payment. I do not currently qualify for disability. I do qualify for special enrollment through the health.gov marketplace. However  when i enter my zip code  there are only 5 plans offered and they are all from a company (Ambetter) that is also out of network for the hospital. I can purchase Short Term Health Insurance  however  they do not cover any pre-existing conditions or anything that consulted on 12 months prior to enrolling. So  my insurance options are not hopeful at this point. Travel and lodging: Due to safety reasons  I have to stay in Charleston until after my 2 week follow-up appointment and suture removal. Travel and lodging expenses for myself  and my family will be around $3000 total. This includes renting a home in Charleston for 2 1/2 weeks (as I will need privacy and quiet while healing. Also  there is no way that I am going to be in Charleston for 3 weeks and not have my family with me)  gas and hotel stays for the 2400-mile round-trip.Follow-up and Recovery: I will have to travel back to Charleston in a year after surgery for follow-up scans to check for regrowth. I will also need physical therapy  briefly  to help me get my balance and strength back after surgery. Medications will add to the expenses. After brain surgery  i will not be able to work for a few months and will require help with many of my daily life activities. This will make it more of a strain to pay for household expenses. Help me get my life back!I don't feel like \"me\" anymore. This tumor is taking so much away from me and my family. I don't like to travel anymore  because the vertigo and motion sickness are too much to handle. I can't enjoy time outside for very long due to severe light sensitivity and heat sensitivity. I can't spend much time playing with my one-year old before I am too tired to even move or tremors force me to sit out. Tremors and vision issues make photography and painting a frustrating challenge. My severe insomnia and fatigue make it nearly impossible to enjoy life or function. My emotional outbursts and anxiety are crippling. I have been slowing turning into someone else  and I need \"me\" back. My family needs me back.Please donate! Help me get rid of this tumor and get my life back!Please share  share  share with everyone you know. The more people that see this  the better my chances of meeting my goal are!Thanks so much for your support!Much love Melanie(Moey)I am also selling tshirts that I designed for brain tumor awareness.

Freddie  his wife and their 3 children along with family and friends are not giving up the fight! Freddie has not been to work since October (after the swelling of his brain  his 26 day hospital stay and therapy) money has been overwhelming tight. Not to mention an unexpected move on top of things! His job and all his work ppl have been very very understanding and have gone out of their way to donate time to Freddie and help keep him covered by insurance as long as possible!

Holly has been back and forth with trying to get Freddie approved disability retirement insurance thru his job so he can keep his health insurance but it has not been approved at this time! There is a lot to applying for any type of disability and the progress that many of you do not know and hopefully you will not ever need to know. This family has been battling this battle for almost 2 years and at this point the financial strain has become almost the undoing of this family!! IAs you all know Freddie and Holly’s last visit to MDA was not a good one and Freddie has been making improvements (Holly had talked to an all natural vitamin specialist and added some new things to his diet; as well as the continued therapy) but with the MRI showing new spots and the swelling of his brain everything has been so unknown! The fear is great but the fight is greater! Holly has been looking into different facilities and is hoping to get approval for a 2nd opinion and to take Freddie to another world renowned cancer treatment facility whom is known as #1 for brain cancer txt (there are a couple however their all out of state)! They have been so happy with MDA but as many of you know the options that were given last month were NOT idea and Holly still is unsure what the right direction to go in! A 2nd opinion is their hope at this point and I know that it would help ease their minds. They will be following up with MDA soon and hopefully Holly can give you more details on the progress later! To say the least this family is asking for you all to come out and help support  donate  socialize and/or pray for them!"

She has multiple autoimmune disorders but was most recently diagnosed with Lupus in 2018. The medication Lily needs is called Benlysta and it's very expensive. Lily used most of her health savings account paying for the January 2019 medication copay of $2 480.44 and doesn't have enough left over to pay for February's medication or to reach her insurance's annual out of pocket maximum of $4 500.00. This also means Lily won't have any funds left in her health savings account for other expenses like medication  dental care  etc.  (Lily has a high deductible health insurance plan which means that full insurance rates and privileges only kick in once she reaches $4 500 in out-of-pocket expenses.) Lily already works full time for the American Cancer Society as well as working part time doing pet care through Rover . Even the extra income from working two jobs isn't enough to cover the upcoming February medical expenses. While she has done her best to manage on her own as much as possible  it is time to ask for the help of friends  family  and the community. (In addition to pet sitting services   Lily also does custom hair color by request!

If you know Darren  then you know what a truly amazing generous upbeat soul he is. He is my blessing in life  and the absolute best husband ever. In the 27 years I have known him  he has always been kind  loving and supportive. He is also the person who continually goes out of his way to help others in any given situation. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. Even now  his cheerful positive outlook is a joy to all who cross his path. We call him Rock Star because he loves music  especially classic rock.Darren and I now  and 27 years ago :-)We have not yet found health insurance that will cover the cost of his brain surgery. Hopefully this will change  but as of now  I am setting pride aside and asking for prayers  healing energy  and financial assistance to help us get through this difficult time. It is very difficult and humbling to ask for help  but we have faith that the Lord will provide  and believe that this may be an avenue for His work.HOW YOU CAN HELP:Prayers and healing energy  thank you. If you have the ability to donate  it will mean more than I can possibly express. If you can forward this to others  that would be awesome.If you have suggestions for fundraising or other advice  please let me know.Thank you so so much for your support and prayers! You are literally saving his life.MEDICAL DETAILS:His tumor is a macroadenoma  measuring 2.3 by 2 centimeters  a little smaller than a golf ball. It is most likely benign  thank God  but is in a difficult position at the bottom of the brain  pushing on his pituitary gland and his optic nerve  just above the brain stem. It has permanently affected his pituitary gland  and has compromised his optic nerve  so his vision is threatened as well. It has evidently been growing for several years  and it will need to be removed very soon.The tumor has wreaked havoc with his adrenal system  and caused his sodium levels to drop to life threatening lows on numerous occasions when he has lost consciousness.

This is my story of my past 6 years with Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease. How I got hereMay 2013I had been working in my garden for a couple of days. The next day I woke up with a skull crushing headache  stiff neck  joint pain and fever. Two days later of intense symptoms  my husband noticed a bulls eye rash on my body. I tested positive for Lyme disease and Anaplasmosis.  I was put on antibiotics right away  but each day my symptoms kept getting worse. From that point on  I quickly declined. Neurological symptoms took over my body.  Burning head  crushing headaches  stiff neck  tinnitus  joint pain  dropping items  twitching  frozen body (where I can’t move) and brain shaking (it felt like my brain was in a blender). My dizziness was so intense that I could not sit up for 8 months. It felt like a G-Force so strong  that if I tried to lift my head it would push it down.I could not walk. I was unable to process information and struggled to speak. I was unable to care for myself.TodayOver the past 6 years  I have been fortunate to have a few great doctors by my side. They have fought hard for me  shown me compassion and are constantly working to find ways to help me and their other Lyme patients.95% of this disease’s expenses is not covered by health insurance. We have paid out of pocket for doctors  antibiotics  stem cell therapy  ozone therapy (which has been my one life saver)  ER visits  MRI’s  pain management  herbs and vitamin therapies. My current/past treatments have helped a lot  but I am still not making enough progress. Presently  my symptoms are about 30% better than 2013. However  six years later  I am still bed bound each day. I am unable to do things like wash my hair  prepare my meals  spend time with my friends and family  watch a movie  take my dog for a walk and sometimes just getting out of bed is impossible due to the pain. What does it feel like for me to live with Chronic Neurological Lyme disease each day?- Electrocution to the brain: That comes up the center of my brain and shocks me. It is extremely painful and can last for hours or days. - Head on fire: Feels like I have been set on fire.- Nerve pain up the spine  hands  face.- Tremors- Ice pick headaches combined with head pressure- Memory loss: short term memory loss  confusion  difficulty with speech and word finding- Dizziness- Tinnitus - Numb limbs making it difficult to walk.- Joint pain- Muscle twitching- Nausea- Chronic FatigueMy next stepI cannot continue to live like this  because it is not living. I want to feel human and be myself again. I have done lots of research and after reading other Lyme patients testimonials  I believe Klinic St George in Germany is where I need to be. Dr Douwes is the physician that discovered hyperthermia as an effective treatment for Lyme diseaseThe Klinik has been treating Lyme patients since 2000 and cancer patients since 1992.They have had great results in using Hyperthermia treatment to fight Lyme disease. You can read more information about the treatment on their website:A link to Klinik St. Georg: https://www.klinik-st-georg.de/en/klinik-st-georg/lyme-specialized-center/lyme-treatment-protocol/Testimonials from patients that have gone to Klinic St. Georg: https://www.klinik-st-georg.de/en/patient-information/testimonials/I have been awarded a grant and been accepted by Klinic St. Georg for treatment. - The Klinic has reserved a spot for my care.- A Lyme foundation has awarded me a grant to help pay for this   treatment.                                                                                     I feel very blessed and am thankful for this opportunity.Unfortunately  even with the foundations help  we will still struggle to come up with the remainder amount.We would be so grateful for any small donations to help me get to the Klinic. All proceeds will go towards my treatment and recovery.WHAT YOUR DONATIONS WILL COVER My Lyme treatment will be as an in-patient with 24 hour access to doctors and nursesBreakdown of cost:€17 500 for two week treatment at the clinic$1 000 for flight€200 for shuttle to and from clinic. * The balance of cost will cover additional funds to pay for the after-care protocol and medications they send me home with. Want to learn more about Lyme disease?Lyme in the 21st CenturyThis is an older documentary but very informative.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvCI0-iHhuIUnder our skin http://underourskin.com/uos1/#filmYour support means the world to me. Whether it be financial or just sharing my page to help me spread awareness about Lyme disease. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Thank you.Barbra"

She has multiple autoimmune disorders but was most recently diagnosed with Lupus in 2018. The medication Lily needs is called Benlysta and it's very expensive. Lily used most of her health savings account paying for the January 2019 medication copay of $2 480.44 and doesn't have enough left over to pay for February's medication or to reach her insurance's annual out of pocket maximum of $4 500.00. This also means Lily won't have any funds left in her health savings account for other expenses like medication  dental care  etc.  (Lily has a high deductible health insurance plan which means that full insurance rates and privileges only kick in once she reaches $4 500 in out-of-pocket expenses.) Lily already works full time for the American Cancer Society as well as working part time doing pet care through Rover . Even the extra income from working two jobs isn't enough to cover the upcoming February medical expenses. While she has done her best to manage on her own as much as possible  it is time to ask for the help of friends  family  and the community. (In addition to pet sitting services   Lily also does custom hair color by request! Accepting new clients now. ^_^ ) Any and all funds raised will be used towards upcoming medical bills or to help rebuild the HSA balance lost when making the January payment. Supporting documents such as bills  receipts  or insurance statements will be posted in the comments below."

If you know Darren  then you know what a truly amazing generous upbeat soul he is. He is my blessing in life  and the absolute best husband ever. In the 27 years I have known him  he has always been kind  loving and supportive. He is also the person who continually goes out of his way to help others in any given situation. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. Even now  his cheerful positive outlook is a joy to all who cross his path. We call him Rock Star because he loves music  especially classic rock.Darren and I now  and 27 years ago :-)We have not yet found health insurance that will cover the cost of his brain surgery. Hopefully this will change  but as of now  I am setting pride aside and asking for prayers  healing energy  and financial assistance to help us get through this difficult time. It is very difficult and humbling to ask for help  but we have faith that the Lord will provide  and believe that this may be an avenue for His work.HOW YOU CAN HELP:Prayers and healing energy  thank you. If you have the ability to donate  it will mean more than I can possibly express. If you can forward this to others  that would be awesome.If you have suggestions for fundraising or other advice  please let me know.Thank you so so much for your support and prayers! You are literally saving his life.MEDICAL DETAILS:His tumor is a macroadenoma  measuring 2.3 by 2 centimeters  a little smaller than a golf ball. It is most likely benign  thank God  but is in a difficult position at the bottom of the brain  pushing on his pituitary gland and his optic nerve  just above the brain stem. It has permanently affected his pituitary gland  and has compromised his optic nerve  so his vision is threatened as well. It has evidently been growing for several years  and it will need to be removed very soon.The tumor has wreaked havoc with his adrenal system  and caused his sodium levels to drop to life threatening lows on numerous occasions when he has lost consciousness. We have had to take many scary ambulance rides in the last few years  not knowing why he was so deathly ill  so we are grateful to have finally learned the reason. Because of the location of the tumor  it will be a delicate surgery.

Surgery and radiation are not an option  and chemotherapy is the only treatment possible.  Her Oncology team planned to begin the most aggressive chemo treatment available more than a month ago.  But in the past several weeks  she has been hospitalized twice  for more than a week at a time  for serious complications due to the rapid growth of the tumor/cancer  and has had to endure numerous surgeries and procedures. This has unfortunately weakened her to such a degree that the doctors now can only treat her with the mildest form of chemotherapy  the first session only able to begin one week ago.  Her strength and health have deteriorated quickly. All of these things have significantly reduced her time left with us.As you can imagine  the hospital bills are piling up. Even with good health insurance  the costs of her medical care and medications are extensive. We  her very small family  are providing for her all of the care  comfort  and necessities of life that we are able to .  She doesn't ask for much  but we are having trouble providing the things that she needs - much less the things that she would be so grateful to have to make her last months more comfortable. Items such a special memory foam mattress pad to make all the time she must spend in bed more tolerable  proper food for her very specialized diet  message therapy to ease the pain of her poor aching body  wheelchair  adjustable or hospital bed  many many medications  and of course the hugely expensive cost of doctors and healthcare.Then there are the things we'd love to do for her if we could. For example:  one last trip to Disney World (in a wheelchair of course)  a trip to Myrtle Beach to see our younger sister graduate from college in May  a Spa Day to make her feel pretty again  see a ballet  last family portraits  etc..  But we can't provide these things because due to a very unfortunate  ill-timed turn of events  the main financial provider of the family was laid off just last week because of downsizing in the company he worked for.  This makes it a challenge to even pay the mortgage  utility bills  food  and normal expenses of life. The rest of the family includes our mother who works 6 to 7 days a week (but in seasonal job which hasn't yet started back up for this year)  a younger sister still in college  and myself- who works two jobs. We're doing the best that we can and \"getting by\"  but your help would be so very appreciated. So that we can afford the extra things that would make Sandi more comfortable in her final months.  We are very thankful for any amount you can afford  and if you can't donate monetarily  we are grateful for your prayers.  And if you are comfortable sharing this campaign with those in  your own circles  we will appreciate it very much.Please let me know if you have questions  or if you would like any additional information.I will also be sending updates through this page  to let you know how your generous donations are being used.Thank you so very much and God Bless."

Well now Shannon needs OUR help. On Wednesday March 27th  2019  Shannon underwent a surgery that may have potentially life changing consequences.  After multiple MRI's and scans  Doctors discovered multiple fist-sized tumors in her abdomen area that are pressing on her other organs and have been causing her to have dizzy and fainting spells.  As for the level of risk these tumors pose to her overall health  it is unkown at this time.  The scary part of this is her Dr's will not be able to actually diagnose her medical status until the tumors have been fully biopsied in the lab.  This will mean many more tests to come.  Beyond the scans  anesthesia and the actual surgery  Shannon is facing countless medical bills from every facet of this daunting procedure. So I've created this GoFundMe to help her with the sizable medical debt that is coming (as sure as the sun rises and sets). Fortunately she does have health insurance  but like so many of us  it's a high deductible policy (very high) that still has quite a ways to go to be met and she has thrown all her savings into it.

He did dialysis for about 3 years and miraculously his kidneys regained function. Fast forward to December 2013 his luck ran dry  but no need to get sad he got a refill. Marquis had to restart dialysis and has been doing it for the last five years. Once Marquis obtained the proper health insurance  he decided to try to get on the transplant list. On October 1st he started the process to get his name on the list  and on October 30 he completed the process and was told he will receive a letter to let him know if he was approved. On November 3rd  he got a call that he was a backup to a potential donor and the next morning got the call that the kidney would be going to him. With that being said  the surgery was a success and he is now in the recovery process.  Recovery starts as a three month journey that requires him to be out of work. It also requires him to have a caregiver 24/7 for those three months  which would be me  his wife. The process was so quick it didn’t allow us enough time to financially prepare to be out of work for 3 months. Even the nurses called it a miracle for the timeframe. We also have a son who is in his senior year of high school who is getting excited for College next fall.Furthermore  in order for the new kidney to work there are immuno-suppressant drugs that Marquis needs to take for the rest of his life.  Although insurance covers majority of the medications there are a few that are still quite pricey. Also  with both of us being out of work for 3 months at such short notice we need assistance with bills and our sons senior class fees. Marquis had this to say; I come to you all today as a humbled man. With me being out of work for three months (maybe more) and my wife being out of work for three months we’re going to need for you all to find it in your hearts to be a blessing to the Murdaugh family. Please don’t think any amount is too small “little by little a little becomes a lot”Please keep Marquis and our family in your thoughts and prayers. We appreciate any help we can get  thank you!"

He never had a history of medical issues in the past. He was rushed to the nearest hospital and after several tests  doctors discovered an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation). AVM is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins  usually in the brain or spine. AVM is very rare in which there are fewer than 200 000 US cases per year. Fortunately  due to the seizure  we were able to discover this AVM before it ruptured. The neurosurgeon advised that he undergoes surgery as soon as possible due to the size of his AVM (see photo 1). You can see that there is a large black area to the right of the brain scan  which shows his veins being \"clogged\". Unluckily  James did not have health insurance at this time because he got a new job and his company insurance would not activate until the following December. On August 2nd  2017  James underwent a 9-hour brain surgery. Thankfully  his surgery was a success. And while he was discharged after about a week in the ICU  he was continuously accumulating medical bills/costs day by day. After 3 months of being seizure free  James started getting seizures again and was admitted to the ER several times. After each visit  his neurologist kept increasing his dosage on both his medications (Keppra and Vimpat). He is now at maximum dosage.Although James is currently doing well  he is overwhelmed with medical bills with a minimum balance of $400 per bill. After each visit to the specialist and the ER  he has over 15 bills to pay off in conjunction with other household and student bills. While we are doing everything we can  due to the high minimum balances  the bills have now been sent to the collections agency. We ask for your help. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have been employed  as a groomer  by Bella's Grooming for the past 2 years. Richard & Christina are my bosses but they have become sincere friends that I care deeply about. We have all spent a lot of time together both at work and outside of it and I have gotten to know them well.If you don't know their story  Richard & Christina moved from NY to VA in March 2015. They opened their shop in April 2015 and have been serving the community for almost 4 years. They built their business from the ground up  often working long days. I've seen them come in early  stay late and even work on their days off. Richard has been grooming for close to 18 years and I have learned so much from him in my time here. He will always stop what he's doing to both show and explain things to me. Christina does a lot of things here but primarily does \"front of the house.\" She usually always deals with the customers. I have found her to be friendly & personable. We could be having an insane day and she always takes a moment to converse with every person that calls or stops by. After years of hard work  they were finally able to purchase their first home in May 2018.If you do not know  this family has fallen on tough times recently. In August 2018  their son Hadrian aka Georgie was diagnosed with Level 2 Autism. In December 2018  Richard was diagnosed with advance stage lymphoma. During the month of December  Richard did not have health insurance. In December  he had 2 hospital stays  2 surgeries  an MRI  CT Scan  multiple prescriptions and started chemotherapy...all without health coverage. Though Rich is \"lucky\" to have health coverage for 2019  the treatments he is undergoing are considered somewhat \"experimental\". Their insurance company continues to fight them tooth & nail on most claims they receive. Aside from medical bills  they  like all of us  have day to day expenses  household expenses  etc. They are commuting to both Farmville & Lynchburg daily for treatments. I think that Richard & Christina are the backbone of America. They are small business owners that live and work in the community they serve. They employ local people (me) and help keep money in Charlotte County. They have worked too hard to have everything they've achieved be taken away by the ugly disease that is cancer. Since they are self-employed  they don't get the luxuries that some of us may take for granted including sick time  medical leave  holiday pay  etc. If they're not working  they're not making money. Dedicating time to work can be difficult while dealing with an intensive treatment regimen & daily commutes.I wanted to start this fundraiser as a way to help some folks I care about. We have watched each other's kids grow. Georgie was only 4 months old when I started here  now hes over 2 years! They were there for me at the hospital when I had my daughter. They were also at my wedding in August 2018. I'm asking everyone  if you can help in some way  please do so. Even the smallest donation will make a difference to this family."

It never comes at the \"right\" time or under the \"right\" circumstances. That being said  I can think of few worse times to hear those awful words  than when your wife is 8 months pregnant with your first child and you've just begun to start your young family. That is what my brother and his wife heard last Friday when they were informed that he has a Choroidal Melanoma in his left eye. This is considered to be an aggressive cancer although thankfully it has been caught in stage 1. Quickly removing the cancer can result in a good long term outcome. Unfortunately the nearest treatment center for this type of cancer is in NYC  therefore my brother and his wife face travel expenses they hadn't anticipated  along with the potential cost of non-covered treatments. Due to longstanding financial hardship  my brother has gone without health insurance since the age of 18 until recently at the age of 35. Thankfully  he finally has insurance and was able to catch the cancer before it became terminal. He needs urgent treatment  which most likely necessitates the removal of his left eye due to the size of the tumor and proximity to the optic nerve  because this cancer can rapidly become fatal. With the costs of starting a new family especially with a little girl on her way he's now left wondering how to cover the added expenses suddenly thrust upon him. I hope this GoFundMe campaign will help make this painful process a little less burdensome and ease some of the stress on his mind as he faces the removal of his eye and an uncertain future as a cancer victim. Every little bit helps especially everyone's thoughts and prayers.Please help us spread the word and share this with your friends <3"

It affected my breathing my oxygen level and had me in bed for around 6 weeks. I developed pneumonia from it and saw a noticeable marked difference before and after the flu with my breathing. With no Health Insurance I did what many Moms do…put ourselves on the least priority list. I honestly thought I would just get better. My Dr. thought I had some damage to my lungs due to the pneumonia but it was manageable. I had a chronic cough but it really did not impact nor affect my daily life. I was told I had mild asthma and allergies which made sense. I used an inhaler when I had flare ups and everyone around me became numb to my cough. I am not a smoker nor ever have been. people who are smokers smoke outside when I am near by and my home is 100% smoke free. I cared for animals  lifted heavy bags of feed  exercised and despite coughing spells and frequent bronchitis I was impacted very minimally. It became my normal. In July during one of my coughing spells I started coughing up blood. Even us tried and true Martyr Moms know this is the time to get to a Dr. We recently acquired a high deductible Health Insurance policy so decided to use it. My Dr thought I had a sinus infection she decided to do a sinus ct scan and add on a chest ct in case. At the hospital the techs broke character and shockingly asked me if I worked at an asbestos factory. I knew the scan was abnormal but was not ready to hear that I had Chronic Interstitial Lung Disease with Pulmonary Fibrosis. My Pulmonary Dr. assured me while it is labeled as incurable many treatments including lung transplant can greatly increase quality of life and life span. We were devastated to hear this. 5 years? How is this possible for a nonsmoking very active female? This is something 90-year-old men get after heavy smoking for years  right? Upon further scans Dr's became concerned with a dark mass on my lower left lung. Upon several attempts at biopsy and a very painful open lung biopsy  I was told that the tumor is Non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer.  A further Pet Scan found another active spot on my upper right lobe that is the same cancer type. Apparently  the bad condition of my lungs makes my cells reproduce as cancer cells instead of healthy cells. At my most recent visit Hopkins Dr's told me that due to my Lung Disease they cannot aggressively treat the cancer and due to the cancer  they cannot properly treat my Lung disease. They labeled me as incurable and said on average people in my situation live about 1 year. They are offering Chemotherapy to see if they can slow the progression of cancer growth and prolong my life. My first treatment was on November 28th. Thus far my body is handling the chemo well. I have faith and hope. I am also trying Chinese medicine and some alternative therapies. Now adding insult to injury when people like myself hear devastating news like this  many things happen. You see the sadness and horror in your friends and family’s eyes. You realize that all your plans for Grandkids  growing old with your kids and spouse and friends are all in jeopardy. You watch as income dwindles and expenses rise and see the immense impact your illness has on those you love. Agencies that are supposed to be your safety net treat you like you are trying to pull one over on them. So instead of enjoying every minute with your family you are visiting lawyers  getting loans on your house and signing papers to try to extend your life. It is devastating. My goal in life is and has always been to help others. My prayer is that if even 1 person goes to see their Dr for an annoying cough and gets early treatment and saves them and their families from going through what we are then it will be worth being open about our current struggles."

Well now Shannon needs OUR help. On Wednesday March 27th  2019  Shannon underwent a surgery that may have potentially life changing consequences.  After multiple MRI's and scans  Doctors discovered multiple fist-sized tumors in her abdomen area that are pressing on her other organs and have been causing her to have dizzy and fainting spells.  As for the level of risk these tumors pose to her overall health  it is unkown at this time.  The scary part of this is her Dr's will not be able to actually diagnose her medical status until the tumors have been fully biopsied in the lab.  This will mean many more tests to come.  Beyond the scans  anesthesia and the actual surgery  Shannon is facing countless medical bills from every facet of this daunting procedure. So I've created this GoFundMe to help her with the sizable medical debt that is coming (as sure as the sun rises and sets). Fortunately she does have health insurance  but like so many of us  it's a high deductible policy (very high) that still has quite a ways to go to be met and she has thrown all her savings into it.

It also requires him to have a caregiver 24/7 for those three months  which would be me  his wife.

We also have a son who is in his senior year of high school who is getting excited for College next fall.Furthermore  in order for the new kidney to work there are immuno-suppressant drugs that Marquis needs to take for the rest of his life.  Although insurance covers majority of the medications there are a few that are still quite pricey. Also  with both of us being out of work for 3 months at such short notice we need assistance with bills and our sons senior class fees. Marquis had this to say; I come to you all today as a humbled man. With me being out of work for three months (maybe more) and my wife being out of work for three months we’re going to need for you all to find it in your hearts to be a blessing to the Murdaugh family. Please don’t think any amount is too small “little by little a little becomes a lot”Please keep Marquis and our family in your thoughts and prayers. We appreciate any help we can get  thank you!"

He never had a history of medical issues in the past. He was rushed to the nearest hospital and after several tests  doctors discovered an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation). AVM is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins  usually in the brain or spine. AVM is very rare in which there are fewer than 200 000 US cases per year. Fortunately  due to the seizure  we were able to discover this AVM before it ruptured. The neurosurgeon advised that he undergoes surgery as soon as possible due to the size of his AVM (see photo 1). You can see that there is a large black area to the right of the brain scan  which shows his veins being \"clogged\". Unluckily  James did not have health insurance at this time because he got a new job and his company insurance would not activate until the following December. On August 2nd  2017  James underwent a 9-hour brain surgery. Thankfully  his surgery was a success. And while he was discharged after about a week in the ICU  he was continuously accumulating medical bills/costs day by day. After 3 months of being seizure free  James started getting seizures again and was admitted to the ER several times. After each visit  his neurologist kept increasing his dosage on both his medications (Keppra and Vimpat). He is now at maximum dosage.Although James is currently doing well  he is overwhelmed with medical bills with a minimum balance of $400 per bill. After each visit to the specialist and the ER  he has over 15 bills to pay off in conjunction with other household and student bills. While we are doing everything we can  due to the high minimum balances  the bills have now been sent to the collections agency. We ask for your help. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please keep James in your prayers during this recovery process."

This was not a metastasis of the original Multiple Myeloma   but a new cancer that had developed with no known cause.  She has undergone radiation and chemotherapy and is due for further testing soon to determine her next course of treatment.   Naturally  her family  friends  and all those who love her are saddened by this new diagnosis.

Sadly  last June  Julie was diagnosed with advanced liver disease that has also led to an increasing Alzheimer’s/dementia-like diminishment of cognitive functions. As a result  Julie has been on a leave of absence  but more than likely will never work again.  Steve has been her care giver 24/7 ever since  as Julie cannot be left alone and requires assistance getting in & out of bed  personal care  dressing  preparing meals  etc. To add to their situation  Steve had to leave his position at American Airlines at the end of 2018 because he could not commit to relocating to Ft. Worth  TX and lack of income is now becoming an issue. They have their savings to cover Julie’s to date co-pay and deductible medical expenses not covered by Steve’s health insurance and other household expenses. Those reserves have now been depleted  but Steve is unable to return to the workforce given Julie’s need for constant care.While heavy doses of medications have stabilized side effects such as fluid retention and stomach ulcers  doctors have been advised that a liver transplant is necessary for any hope for Julie’s recovery. They are now working with two transplant centers and pray that Julie’s case will be prioritized high enough and a match can be found before her condition worsens any further. Along with your thoughts and prayers  they could use your financial support for ongoing medical treatments and transplant expenses not covered by insurance  as well as funds to remodel their bathroom to better accommodate Julie and address a few home maintenance issues in need of repair. Any amount you can give would be greatly appreciated by myself and the Cole family. If you are looking for a good cause  then please find it in your hearts to assist them. Please also provide your support by sharing their story on your own Facebook  Twitter and/or Instagram so we can reach a larger audience.Thank you!"

After many doctors appointments  an emergency room visit  and meetings with hospitals and cancer survivors  Eileen finally got the right health insurance and the right team in place. The new team rescanned her lymphoma and found she had an aggressive form of lymphoma called diffuse large B cell.

Then in mid-February while out walking Sam  she began have severe pain in her lower abdomen. After two visits to the ER  it was determined that her small intestine had become wrapped around her lymphoma.

Even in the midst of all this  My hope and positive outlook on life has not withdrawn my hope. It’s fueled by my new found journey to change the yearly Pap smear screening age for women on a Global level. I come to you with a mission in mind because what I’m going through is preventable and no woman should ever have to go through what I’m going through. My name is Neyleen Ashley  but many of you know me as @neybronjamesofficial. The body positive social media influencer that’s always making people laugh and always sharing light and positivity. Many of you know I am a mother of two boys (that I don’t post because of privacy reasons) and I also go to school full time for massage therapy. Currently my only form of income is social media which had recently made a major decline due to the Instagram algorithm and has basically left me living off my savings and supporting a family on my own. I try to communicate with my followers as much as possible and I try to let you into my life because most of my followers are really the only friends I have. I want to be completely transparent with you.  Writing this   sharing my story and seeking your support is .. embarrassing  it’s hard for me   & it makes me feel like I’m losing myself as a woman .. someone who’s goal is to  uplift & inspire each of you to ask you for your support. But my mission is bigger than just me  and for this reason I put this embarrassment down & I ask you for your help. I feel in my heart that I have to be open if I am ever to help someone else . I want to do everything I can to prevent what I am going through right now from happening in someone else’s life... so here it goes:As many of you have seen  I have been going through medical issues and I have been sharing with you all bits and pieces of it  but not my story in its entirety. For the past year and a half I have not been feeling myself  very lethargic.. very dizzy when I stand  terrible and unbearable cramping that makes me stop and crouch down till it goes away  and headaches that have literally consumed my life and make me just want to jump off a bridge... and this is an every day occurrence. I thought maybe it was my diet or lack of sleep and I kept making excuses for it knowing that going to the doctor wasn’t an option for me because I didn’t have health insurance. Two years ago when I was working for a large corporation with benefits and insurance I went to the doctor and my gynocologist and performed my routine pap smear .       (Pap smear: cervical cancer screening) my results came back abnormal and I needed more testing but unfortunately I lost my job and along with that I also lost my insurance benefits and I got so caught up with life and two growing boys that I completely put myself and my health on the back burner. (lesson learned)Two years passed and I just started feeling worse  and worse but I continued to push myself with the hopes that my symptoms would go away  with the hopes I could pour all of my focus into supporting my children and into all of you- but I was wrong. This year  I finally went to my gynecologist with the cheapest insurance I could find  and my papsmear results came back Severely abnormal with high grade cancerous cells. My doctor did further testing and referred me to an Oncologist in Miami (bills already piling up). At the oncologist my doctor spoke to me briefly and also did further testing only to tell me that the cancer I have needs to be surgically removed meaning that about 40% or more of my cervix needs to be surgically removed and my oncologist also has to do exploratory surgery within my uterus and reproductive organs to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread any further. This surgery is urgent and needs to be done on November 20th at a hospital in Miami Florida. I am shaken up and I’m scared but I know that it has to be done. As I was checking out at the doctors office they tell me I have to speak with the financial rep before I leave  and devastatingly enough again  my insurance won’t cover any part of my procedure or anything that has to do with my diagnosis because it’s considered a “pre existing condition” even though my gynecologist has tried to appeal and I have tried to call numerous times and every time they tell me “it is what it is” and they can’t do anything to help me... also  looking for any other insurance at this point is basically out of the question for me with a pre existing condition till January with open enrollment which my surgery can’t wait even one more day as it’s still unknown if I need chemotherapy or radiation as this falls on the outcome of the surgery I urgently need.So now I’m faced with another medical bill to my oncologist for $900.00 not including his fees to preform the surgery  the office visits  the labs  the biopsy  and now the surgery that I so desperately need. Then there’s approximately about $26 000.00 for the facility/hospital and anesthesia even though we all know that bills just keep coming after that still and I really don’t know what to do anymore which is why I am seeking your help.Because I have a family   because If I am to continue my mission for Globalizing this awareness to save other women - I will need to undergo this treatment   I will need your help to Continue my journey. When I asked myself if I should set up a GoFundMe  I hesitated. “Everyone’s got financial needs  why should I get assistance that people probably need for themselves and their families?” But i then  I discussed with family and classmates and it made sense to at least try  since this surgery is time sensitive and urgent. Because this is a matter that is life threatening & I have global plans to return the faith each of you give me... I realized that I have a very difficult road ahead  and I can’t do this without help. the possibilities are still unknown when it comes to my health  and we don’t know what further treatment may be needed in the future. But one thing is certain  I will need help. I wanted to thank everyone that has atleast read this story. I appreciate you all  and I will come back from this stronger and an even more powerful woman. If you can’t donate please don’t feel bad  kindly leave a message of encouragement as that alone has pulled me through many tough times. Women  please get your pap smears done.. ask your mother  partner  girlfriend  wife if they’ve had their annual cervical cancer screening. Because only together   through support & educating our daughters  our women; can we save lives."

A woman that I learned about on Facebook.  Her name is Susan and like you and me she has a family and community of friends that she loves and cherishes. Unfortunately  Susan is in renal failure and a transplant is the only way to save her life.  It's the only way that she will love to see her granddaughter grow-up  the only way that she will be able to grow old with her husband. This is where I come in. After weeks of testing   meetings  and conversations we are nearing the end game. I will be donating my kidney to Susan and God willing it will extend her life by another 15-20 years....maybe more!So the burning question- why this GoFundMe page? The only road block is a financial one. Susan's health insurance will cover all my testing and up to my post-operation visit at 10 days.  Other than that there is no financial support for a living donor. I will be out of work for approximately a month and during that time I can apply for temporary disability which after 6-8 weeks of waiting would pay approximately 66% of my current salary. the rest is up to me. Buy law Susan cannot offer me any monetary compensation. So now I look to you  my friends  family  and community to help me SAVE SUSAN's LIFE- if you can help me make ends meet while I recover from donating my kidney to Susan.

Right after we became engaged we found out Paul had stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma. He had to have a port put in his chest for seven months of chemotherapy. Due to complications from the port procedure a nerve bundle was clipped/damaged giving Paul permanent nerve damage there. The chemical cocktail that was his chemo did save his life and Paul is now cancer free. However  the nerve damage from the port surgery and the nerve damage in his hands and feet from the side effects of chemo left him unable to work full time or enjoy many things in life. It’s really hard to see a loved one in pain. It makes you want to hold their hand and touch them. Unfortunately the pain is so great that the physical comfort only makes it worse. 2 years after getting married and moving to Portland for better healthcare options  an experimental treatment was found. It has been a true blessing! It’s a simple  albeit painful  procedure that has changed our lives. It relieves the pain for 4 to 6 months and enables Paul to be able to work and keep our health insurance. It enables me to be able to hold my husband’s hand. I work full time. We are moving into a tiny house in order to cut costs and be able to afford his treatments. We are building the tiny house ourselves and both working. His treatments cost $2000 per treatment and he needs 2-3 a year. I’m asking for enough to get us through the year and allow me to save enough so we don’t have to worry anymore about his pain stopping our lives. I love him so much. The hardest part of this all is seeing him in pain. The second hardest part is asking for help. It’s very hard and humbling. His pain has started to return and I can’t live with myself if I don’t try everything I can to make this happen for him. He’s a wonderful  loving husband and has been so very good to me. In many ways we are lucky because this hard road we have traveled showed us exactly how much we mean to each other. Thank you for taking the time to read our story."

Fer has been in the ICU at a major teaching hospital in a medically induced coma since January 11th  2019 due to complications from the FLU. He had been hospitalized at another hospital but had to be transferred to his current hospital because of the severity of his situation. He needed a special machine to breath for him. That machine is currently doing 100% of the breathing for him. He is intubated and needs constant IV fluids while his doctors work to bring him back to consciousness. He is connected to more devices that we can count  including  a machine that purifies his blood. His wonderful wife  Andrea  has been by his side every step of the way. His family  who lives abroad  flew in to be with him. Fernando is the breadwinner of his family so his wife needs help paying for the insurmountable medical expenses as well as for rent  food  health insurance  daily expenses  child care  etc. Doctors are not sure when they'll be able to wean him off all the machines he is connected to or when they'll be able to wake him up from the medically induced coma. He will probably be in the ICU for a while and in the hospital for several weeks. Please help Fer and his family in any way you can so they can focus on him and his recovery. We are confident he is in the best hands and has a dedicated team of doctors and nurses in one of the best hospitals in Miami. Any amount helps and will be appreciated. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers and thank you for your support!He can use all the love and support he can get.PS: if the page is prompting you to leave a \"tip\" and you don't want to do it  you can click on the drop down menu where the tip percentages are and select \"other.\" Then  a box should appear so you can type the amount desired.

Lo conocemos desde que éramos niños y el es como un hermano para nosotros. El tiene un corazón enorme y siempre apoya a quien sea que lo necesite. Desafortunadamente el está muy enfermo. Fer se encuentra en un estado de coma inducido en la unidad de cuidados intensivos de un renombrado hospital universitario desde el 11 de Enero del 2019 a causa de el virus de la influenza (FLU). Estuvo hospitalizado en otro hospital pero tuvo que ser trasladado al hospital actual por la gravedad de su situación. El necesitaba una máquina especial que respirara por el. Actualmente  la máquina respira por el al 100%. Fernando está entubado y conectado a muchas vías y sueros mientras los médicos trabajan arduamente para tratar de que recobre el conocimiento. Está conectado a más máquinas de las que podemos contar  incluyendo a una máquina que le purifica la sangre.El tiene una esposa maravillosa  Andrea  que no se ha separado de él en ningún momento. A pesar de que la familia de Fernando vive fuera del país  se vinieron para acá para estár con el y apoyarlo. Fernando es el el sostén económico de su familia así que su esposa necesita ayuda tanto con los gastos médicos exorbitantes  como con los gastos de renta  comida  seguro de salud  gastos diarios  de gastos de cuidad de la niña mientras estaen el hospital  etc. Los Doctores no saben cuando podrán desconectar a Fernando de todas las máquinas y \"despertarlo\" del coma inducido. Probablemente estará en la unidad de cuidados intensivos por un buen tiempo y en el hospital por varias semanas más. Por favor ayuda a Fer y a su familia para que puedan continuar enfocándose en el y su recuperación.

Friday  December 20th my Urologist diagnosed Prostate Cancer. The following day  my Oncologist called me into her office to diagnose Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (I'm so thankful I ran out of doctors!).  I applied for FMLA which will give me 12 weeks of protected leave however  I don't have 12 weeks of sick or vacation left with all of the medical appointments I've been using in the discovery portion of my symptoms. This will leave me losing the ability to keep my Life Insurance and Health Insurance policies in place in just a couple of weeks when my paid leave is exhausted and I am reduced to Leave Without Pay. I was hoping to apply for SSDI but  unfortunately  non-essential offices like the Social Security Administration are closed until further notice. And I just learned (through the Cancer Legal Resource Center online) that SSDI doesn't even kick in until 5 months after application. My Oncologist wants me in the hospital and on aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments right away. AML is fatal within  weeks or months. Treatment will mean at least a couple of months in a sterile  controlled hospital environment. If I were to consider treatment  I would have to know that I could keep my insurances in place in order to defray the costs and continue treatment. Without your help  I'll just have to forgo treatment altogether. I have always been the wage-earner in this family and have never been in this position before. I'm at a loss as to how I'm going to continue any treatment I've started if my health insurance policy cancels. And I don't know how I'll provide for my wife if I succumb to this without my Life Policy in full-force. Please consider helping me fight this fight. Every great story in the Bible has a test...this is mine. I know that God will be with me every step of the way. He has always blessed me and my family and  no matter what happens  we will be blessed again. Please keep this family in your prayers and thank you so much for considering this appeal. Lastly  if any of you have been in this situation and can advise of resources or courses of action  please share with me. Thanks!"

My mother currently does not have health insurance and will not until February 2019.

Mark's cancer was identified as a Stage IV. A tumor in his right pelvic area was detected and has already metastasized to his brain and lungs. He was given a prognosis of a 12-24 month life expectancy if treatment was successful. Since there is no cure  Mark's comfort and time are the hopes that he and his wife Kim  along with their five children  friends and family have clung to.Due to the fact that Mark is battling a very aggressive form of cancer an aggressive treatment plan was needed. He was forced to leave work and begin using up his accumulated sick leave. This will end shortly  at which point he will begin short term disability. He will likely lose his income and need to pay for his health insurance benefits out of pocket. His wife  Kim  works as a preschool teacher at a church daycare. Kim has taken a leave of absence without pay so that she can be there to care for Mark and be with him at his appointments and treatments. Shortly after diagnosis a round of chemo was initiated along with three targeted brain radiation sessions. At this time  the cancer has not responded to the chemo. His brain and lung tumors are increasing both in size and in number and the tumor in his groin has grown and is causing him considerable pain. Since treatment began  he has been hospitalized at the Buffett Cancer Center in Omaha on three separate occasions. Currently  chemo has been placed on hold and he is receiving aggressive radiation to his brain and eventually his lungs and groin. His physical condition is weak and the outlook is discouraging  but Mark continues to fight with hope that the radiation will relieve some of his symptoms and give him more time with his loved ones and friends. Mark and Kim have been blessed by the outpouring of generosity from friends and family  but as you can imagine the financial strain is starting to take a toll. Those of you who know Mark as a friend  know him as a fun-loving guy who is always willing to lend a hand. As a Special Ed teacher he pours his heart and soul into his students helping them identify their worth by teaching life skills and job training.  As a father  he taught his boys how to hunt and fish and was a role model to his daughter's of what a husband and father should be. And as a husband  his love  respect and adoration of Kim is seen in everything he says and does. Mark and Kim rely on their faith daily to get them through the minutes  hours  and days ahead. If it is on your heart to donate to the Staroscik family I know they will be forever grateful. If you cannot give monetarily  prayers are most definitely welcome."

Before I get into the details about her failing health and struggles with receiving care.My mom has served as a nurse for over 30 years and has spent her entire life selflessly caring for those in need. From her children to her patients and beyond  she has always been there for people who need help. Unfortunately  it seems like the healthcare system that she's put so much time into isn't there for her.Growing up  my mom loved going on adventures with us. As kids and young adults  she has taken us to over 15 U.S. states and ventured with us to enjoy summers at the lake in Northwestern Ontario with relatives. Apart from traveling  she has always supported our interests and joins us for fun events  such as Wizard World Comic Con (she even cosplayed as Storm!).(Mom cosplaying as Storm with my sister  Emma  cosplaying as Pikachu)People seem to gravitate towards my mother. She makes friends easily wherever she goes  a skill I wish I had inherited—but I suppose it's not so much a skill as it is her welcoming nature. She is very loved by many people and the news of her failing health has really hit us hard as well as everyone in her life. (Left: Mom with my lifelong friend  Julie... Right: Mom with her sister  Sherry.)As I’m sure you’re aware  the healthcare system in the USA is unreliable  to say the least. So unreliable  in fact  that medical centers are rejecting patients and suggesting fundraising efforts to afford their treatment (yeah  that’s been in the news lately). Unfortunately  the rampant for-profit attitude of health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry has put up major roadblocks that are prohibiting my mother from receiving a transplant. She has less than 10% function left in her kidneys and has been in and out of the hospital countless times the past few months. We have been trying to secure a spot on the transplant waiting list  but every medical center she has applied to has rejected her because they do not accept her insurance and we have no way to pay the costs out-of-pocket (for those who don’t know  kidney transplants typically cost up to $260 000 plus an additional $17 000 per year for the anti-rejection medications). She has tried switching to different insurance companies but that hasn't shaped up well. She is either rejected because of her condition or cannot afford the premiums.Her treatment has cost my family A LOT of money out-of-pocket (copays  deductibles  emergency room visits  overnight stays in intensive care  dialysis times per week  etc)  and frankly  we can’t afford it (but we don’t really have a choice). We have a substantial amount of medical debt and we aren't even getting anywhere in our endeavor to help my mom. This is not sustainable for ANY family  but my family is at a unique financial disadvantage. My father lost his job two years ago and has not been able to find steady work since. My sister has a disability and is unable to work full-time or bring in any sort of reliable income. My mother is unable to work in her condition; she attends dialysis every other day and is too exhausted to complete even basic tasks on her down days. This is why my family is asking for donations to help my mom receive treatment and  hopefully  secure a place on a transplant waiting list. We are all at a loss for what to do and we don’t want to lose my mother  but it feels like all these roadblocks in the healthcare system are condemning her death. Please help us out and considering donating—we are grateful for any amount to help continue her care."

ONE TOUGH COOKIE My name is Jeff Shaw. My younger sister  Laura Mrazik-Stuller  is one of the hardest working people I know  despite the searing back and leg pain that often has her in tears from the moment she wakes up in the morning until the moment she falls asleep at night—usually in a recliner  because lying down flat can be impossible. True to form  however  Laura decided to continue willing herself to work until John  her husband and loving stepfather to her two adult children  underwent treatment for advanced stage liver cancer. ￼ ￼Sadly  John lost his battle on March 23rd. ￼Laura's children  Stephen and Amanda. Over twenty years ago  Laura injured her back working in a restaurant  just a few years after graduating from the Lorain Country Vocational School’s food service program. Her dream of becoming a chef was curtailed by a severe work-related back injury that has caused her incessant and often unbearable pain which has significantly lowered her quality of life and made it impossible to pursue a career in the food industry. Never a quitter  Laura took advantage of a government program to get an education in the IT field. In a little over two years  Laura became a very skilled and in-demand IT professional. As hard a worker as Laura is  work has gotten harder and harder for her thanks to the increasing pain levels  which has made it incredibly challenging for her to drive to work  sit in a chair at work  or even get any rest after work. Laura got temporary relief from her herniated disc and nerve pain from her first surgery in February of last year. For months  Laura was unable to work and got way behind on her bills and health insurance premiums. Five weeks later  unfortunately  her back herniated again during physical therapy  requiring a second surgery in May. What’s really heartbreaking is  Laura expected her operations to result in her returning to work pain free and living an active lifestyle for the first time in decades  and was determined to work even harder to get back on track both financially and personally. But Laura suspected a new herniation while getting X-rays taken at a follow-up visit with her surgeon in October. After Laura's pain increased significantly over the next two months  her back doctor ordered her another MRI in December. That MRI revealed that she has a herniated disc yet again  but this time two nerves are compressed instead of one—and the pain has been beyond excruciating. If she doesn’t receive another operation soon—her third surgery in one year—Laura may lose muscle memory in her leg  along with the ability to walk. ￼￼￼Laura's late husband  John Stuller. WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS While readying himself for his upcoming hernia surgery  John came down with a bad case of both kidney and gall stones that put him in the hospital for a week  sidelining him from his job as an electrical contractor. While John was being treated for the stones  tests revealed advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver cancer with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Although the cancer was treatable  it was not operable or curable. So John had to start his  his treatment immediately  not only to improve quality of life  but also to hopefully extend his life another two to five years. John was enduring so much pain and discomfort himself that he found it difficult to take care of Laura  let alone go to work every day.   This reality convinced Laura that she needed to put off her own surgery until John had recovered  even though there were some days when she could barely walk to her car. ￼ ￼ ￼John had his first TheraSphere radiation treatment 2/28/19 at the Cleveland Clinic. ￼But because the cancer had recently spread to the blood vessels just outside his liver  John needed traditional radiation treatments as well. ￼Sadly  John's battle was cut short when he passed away from complications on Saturday  March 23rd  surrounded by friends and family.Laura  in a rare pain-free moment  after healing from her first operation. THE ROAD AHEAD For the average middle-class family these days  paying the bills is tough enough as it is. Dealing with chronic pain is tough enough as it is. Helping a spouse face a potentially fatal disease is tough enough as it is. Now  imagine juggling all three at the same time. That’s why my family and I would really appreciate your kindness and generosity in this time of need for Laura  especially after losing John.Your donations will help Lauradeal with the scariest and most challenging situation of her life without having to worry about her livelihood. And most important  Laura won’t have to endure needless agony or risk losing the ability to walk by waiting any longer to get the treatment she needs to become healthy again and get on with the next stage of her life.￼The author with Laura and Amanda. The sooner Laura can get her operation  the sooner she can return to a normal life. So please individually donate whatever small amount you can afford so that  together  we can all help my sister cover her health insurance payments and living expenses during their treatment and recovery. Your generous donations will also help with some of her co-pays and medications  as well. My family thanks you in advance."

She will undergo a series of 6 treatments over 18 weeks. Prior to being diagnosed  Angela was hospitalized in critical condition at Iredell Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Duke University Hospital in Durham. She was released after ten days in the hospital and was prescribed antibiotics and Prednisone to treat pneumonia and respiratory infection. A few weeks later  without much improvement  Duke repeated her CT Scans and performed an open lung surgery to get a better biopsy of her lungs  which led to her current diagnosis. Imagine what it would be like to no longer have the network of support in family members and life-long friends beside you as you learn you have a rare cancer and have to fight for your life. Angela and her family recently moved to North Carolina after living in her hometown in western NY all of her life.  She also started a new position in August of this year  which means she has already used all of her vacation time while she was in the hospital. She does not qualify for FMLA to take time off during treatments to heal.  All of this means Angela will need to work as much as possible during her treatments to maintain her health insurance so she can receive these life-saving treatment at Duke University Hospital in Durham  which is a 2 hour commute from her home.  Any time off she takes to undergo her treatments or simply heal herself will be unpaid. Many of you know that Angela herself is a nurse and has a heart of gold. She has been a supporter in her local community back in her home state and now in North Carolina and has been an angel to so many of her friends and family. She has touched countless lives by her giving nature and her healing advice and work. We ask that you consider helping Angela in this fight against cancer by making any donation you feel comfortable with toward her medical expenses and lost income.  She can fight  win and heal from this disease. You can help her get there by sharing from your heart and lessening her and her families stress and burden.  Every little bit helps  and she thanks you all so much for helping her become strong and well again and supporting her in this time of her life."

During their move  Jeff's stomach was hurting pretty badly which prevented him from lifting anything.  The pain continued and increased  so toward the end of November 2018  Jeff went to a doctor in Johnson City  TN.  He had a CT scan that showed caking on the lining of his stomach (cancer) and a PET scan showed even more obvious signs of the cancer.  A laparoscopy was performed to remove a piece of the lining of his stomach.  A biopsy of the lining showed adenocarcinoma (Stage 4) which had  metastasized from another area of his body which cannot be seen.  This is also known as cancer from the unknown primary (CUP).  Jeff started chemotherapy on January 14  2019 but his body was not strong enough and he became very sick; he was admitted to the hospital for a few days.  He received a lighter dose of chemotherapy on January 28 and this will be the plan going forward.  He is no longer able to work due to the pain he is having. Jeff and Lauren have applied for health insurance but have not heard if either one of them have been approved. They do not have life insurance.  Lauren does receive some disability  but Jeff will not receive any disability until May of this year (if he is approved).  Their bills are increasing  and they are using their minimal income for food and other expenses. Jeff and I are first cousins  and he lived with my family for a few years right after he graduated high school while working for the Youth Conservation Corps in the Manistee National Forest. I was just 6 years old at the time but I remember him taking me two-tracking and showing me how to work on his truck. He even showed me how to avoid another vehicle on a very narrow road by driving into a water-filled ditch! He was always working on something in the yard  and we knew when he was close to home because you could hear his truck stereo blasting well before he arrived.  Jeff and Lauren will do anything to help others; they are wonderful people.  Please pray for Jeff and Lauren and give if you are able.  Thank you  Bert"

She will undergo a series of 6 treatments over 18 weeks. Prior to being diagnosed  Angela was hospitalized in critical condition at Iredell Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Duke University Hospital in Durham. She was released after ten days in the hospital and was prescribed antibiotics and Prednisone to treat pneumonia and respiratory infection. A few weeks later  without much improvement  Duke repeated her CT Scans and performed an open lung surgery to get a better biopsy of her lungs  which led to her current diagnosis. Imagine what it would be like to no longer have the network of support in family members and life-long friends beside you as you learn you have a rare cancer and have to fight for your life. Angela and her family recently moved to North Carolina after living in her hometown in western NY all of her life.  She also started a new position in August of this year  which means she has already used all of her vacation time while she was in the hospital. She does not qualify for FMLA to take time off during treatments to heal.  All of this means Angela will need to work as much as possible during her treatments to maintain her health insurance so she can receive these life-saving treatment at Duke University Hospital in Durham  which is a 2 hour commute from her home.  Any time off she takes to undergo her treatments or simply heal herself will be unpaid. Many of you know that Angela herself is a nurse and has a heart of gold. She has been a supporter in her local community back in her home state and now in North Carolina and has been an angel to so many of her friends and family. She has touched countless lives by her giving nature and her healing advice and work. We ask that you consider helping Angela in this fight against cancer by making any donation you feel comfortable with toward her medical expenses and lost income.  She can fight  win and heal from this disease. You can help her get there by sharing from your heart and lessening her and her families stress and burden.  Every little bit helps  and she thanks you all so much for helping her become strong and well again and supporting her in this time of her life."

During their move  Jeff's stomach was hurting pretty badly which prevented him from lifting anything.  The pain continued and increased  so toward the end of November 2018  Jeff went to a doctor in Johnson City  TN.  He had a CT scan that showed caking on the lining of his stomach (cancer) and a PET scan showed even more obvious signs of the cancer.  A laparoscopy was performed to remove a piece of the lining of his stomach.  A biopsy of the lining showed adenocarcinoma (Stage 4) which had  metastasized from another area of his body which cannot be seen.  This is also known as cancer from the unknown primary (CUP).  Jeff started chemotherapy on January 14  2019 but his body was not strong enough and he became very sick; he was admitted to the hospital for a few days.  He received a lighter dose of chemotherapy on January 28 and this will be the plan going forward.  He is no longer able to work due to the pain he is having. Jeff and Lauren have applied for health insurance but have not heard if either one of them have been approved. They do not have life insurance.  Lauren does receive some disability  but Jeff will not receive any disability until May of this year (if he is approved).  Their bills are increasing  and they are using their minimal income for food and other expenses. Jeff and I are first cousins  and he lived with my family for a few years right after he graduated high school while working for the Youth Conservation Corps in the Manistee National Forest. I was just 6 years old at the time but I remember him taking me two-tracking and showing me how to work on his truck. He even showed me how to avoid another vehicle on a very narrow road by driving into a water-filled ditch! He was always working on something in the yard  and we knew when he was close to home because you could hear his truck stereo blasting well before he arrived.  Jeff and Lauren will do anything to help others; they are wonderful people.  Please pray for Jeff and Lauren and give if you are able.  Thank you  Bert"

"Medical","November 16, 2018","Mandy&apos;s Medical Expenses","$4,099","$20,000","51","5","58","343","MACHESNEYPARK","IL","A little bit about Mandy… Mandy is kind  compassionate  selfless  and endlessly optimistic. She handles life with true grace  and until she lost her hair  many people would never have guessed what she has been going through. She continues to spread brightness and joy to all those around her. Caring for others is part of who she is  and no illness will ever change that. But now  she is the one who needs some help  and any contribution would mean the world to Mandy. First  the blood disease… For the past 3 years  Mandy has had a rare disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)as well as Aplastic Anemia. PNH is an acquired  life-threatening disease of the blood  which is characterized by destruction of the red blood cell  blood clots  and impaired bone marrow function. For Mandy  this means she experiences frequent infections  easy bleeding and bruising  headaches  fevers  blood clots  abdominal pain  and back pain. PNH is such a rare disease that even the experts do not know what causes it or the best way to treat it besides a bone marrow transplant. Mandy has participated in 3 separate medical trials  the most recent of which was in February 2018. Finally  this trial showed signs of working! Her bone marrow improved. At the same time  after a long wait  Mandy also found a bone marrow donor through Be the Match  an organization that matches bone marrow donors with recipients. This was great news we had all been waiting and praying for. Unfortunately  any possibility of a bone marrow donation had to wait  because something new became the main concern. Now  the cancer… In March  Mandy was diagnosed with Bladder Cancer. This is very rare at her age  but her doctors believe that the blood disease made her susceptible by compromising her immune system. It is stage 3 bladder cancer because it goes through the full thickness of the bladder  but it has not spread outside the bladder. Due to her blood disease  she cannot do the IV chemotherapy that most bladder cancer patients undergo. Mandy has to take chemo pills  which are less effective than IV chemo. She also gets radiation on her bladder. Meanwhile  she continues to take her trial drugs for the blood disease. Now  she is starting her 4th  round of chemotherapy and radiation on Friday  November 23rd.  The costs… Despite all this  Mandy still works as a CNA  taking care of other people when she is not busy receiving medical care for herself.  She has been fortunate enough to have been given a grant from Aplastic Anemia & MDS International Foundation to cover the once or twice weekly doctor visits and blood draws. The grant also reduces the cost of other expenses  but after health insurance and the grant  she still has to pay the following:·     $218 for chemotherapy drugs every week ($965 per month)·     $8 700 per round of radiation (4th round starts soon)·     $500-$900 bladder scans every 6 weeks·     $1 500 bone marrow biopsies every 3 months·     $1000 per Emergency room visit every few months·     $350 dental treatment for gum disease due to chemotherapy·     $1600 root canal (not from chemo but still important) To add to the expenses  at the end of October  Mandy had her car broken into while she was picking up her trial meds. Among the stolen items were her winter coat  backpack  chemo drugs  and even her medical journal. Needless to say  the financial burden is immense. If you are able to help  any contribution makes a difference and would mean a great deal.Endless thanks Mandy’s friends and family"

We were told there was nothing they could do to stop the growth.  With this disease the liver continues to function while the cysts fill the liver causing it to grow larger and larger.  The liver starts consuming the space in the abdomen pushing and squishing all the other organs. It is painful and a normal life becomes more and more difficult.  A normal liver weighs 3# to 4#  at time of transplant on Feb. 16  2019 Kelly’s weighed 50#!The hospital expense alone for this surgery is in excess of $500 000. Kelly does have health insurance that will help with this and other medical expenses. However with high deductibles  co-pays  and existing medical bills these medical expenses add up. She will be out of work for 4 months or so if all goes well. The short term disability only pays 60% of her salary plus she has to pay her portion of the the health insurance directly. She will have twice weekly travel expenses for lab work and doctors visits  and has been told occasionally she will need to stay nearby the hospital. Kelly’s family and friends have decided to put her case on GoFundMe to spread word about her transplant and for people to keep her in their thoughts and prayers as the process continues.

I decided I had to pay cash and go to the ER to get the fluid drained.  I took Friday September 14 off work and little did I know my life would change once I walked into that hospital.Before and After having 9 liters of fluid drained from my upper abdomen in Sept 2018.I was immediately taken for a CT scan of my abdomen and parsentesis (draining of the fluid in my abdomen).  They were able to retrieve nine liters of fluid from my upper abdomen.  I could suddenly breathe and felt like a new woman. This elation would be short lived.  After returning to the ER from my procedure I was admitted to the hospital.  Not long after getting up to my room a hospital doctor came in and matter of factly said to me \"Your liver isn't causing your problems.  You have ovarian cancer.\"  I must have looked like a deer in the headlights  but this doctor didn't seem to notice.  She said they saw a tumor on my CT scan and think is had spread to my lung that I need to see an Oncologist as soon as possible.  I spent less than 24 hours in the hospital and without insurance the bills are already up to $30 000 and more bills arrive every week. The fluid drained while I was in the ER went through pathology testing and amazingly had no cancer cells in it.  In order to begin treatment they need cancer cells to determine the type and stage of the cancer.  I was now left with only one option...surgery.  A surgery the hospital will not schedule if you do not have health insurance.I was finally able to obtain health insurance through the temp agency I am working for.  My policy doesn't go into effect until Nov 1.  I will have to meet my $6000 deductible for 2018 and come January 1 I'll have to meet the deductible yet again for 2019. My doctors have planned ahead and are ready to begin treatment as soon as my insurance goes into effect.   I'm scheduled for surgery on Nov 2 to obtain tissue samples for biopsy  drain my ascites  install my port for chemo and do some general exploring to see what is really going on in my abdomen.  After 2 weeks of recuperation during which I won't be paid for my time off work I'll go through six rounds of chemo and eventually a hysterectomy.  My goal is to hear I have NED (no evidence of disease) in six months time.Though some days I feel so bad I can barely get out of bed I have not called out sick from work at all. Being a contractor  I only get paid when I'm working  and I need to keep working to provide for my kids and maintain my insurance which the monthly premiums will be lowering my paychecks as well. I've had to swallow my pride and reach out asking for help.  In addition to our usual living expenses I now need to pay off enormous  medical bills  purchase a new AC unit  pay property taxes   and the holidays are rapidly approaching.  I want the holidays to be extra special for my kids this year.  They have been so patient and understanding that Mom has been out of commission for most of this year.  I also need to find a way to get to California to visit my 95 year old grandfather who can't travel to visit me.   I don't know what the future holds  but I do know I want to make more memories with the people I love most.I'm trying to maintain a stress free lifestyle  however this financial burden makes it impossible.   If you feel inclined to contribute financially I would be most appreciative.  I understand if you are not able to contribute financially I will gladly accept any prayers or positive vibes you can send my way.   Thank you in advance for your support."

I am a health care worker  single mother of one very incredible child  and am currently undergoing cancer treatment for the second time. What scares me the most about this second fight is the real possibility I may not survive the financial devastation caused by this illness.I was first diagnosed with stage four Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in 2015. I had multiple tumors  many of which were sticking right out of my body  and I was terrified.  Despite my unwavering faith in God  a very positive attitude  and strong determination to overcome all challenges  I remember begging God “please just let me live long enough to see my 16-year-old son graduate High School.” With the Grace of God and much love from friends and family  I did get to see my son graduate and go on to get accepted to an outstanding college.I went into remission in 2016 and began a new mission. I have always chosen jobs that focused on making a difference in the lives of others.  I had previously worked teaching and coordinating school programs for low-income  high risk children  and as an AIDS prevention outreach worker in poverty-stricken areas  but now I wanted  to “give back” for the outstanding care I received from the doctors  PA’s  NP’s  and other staff that saved my life. So I returned to college to study medical terminology and have worked for the past two years at a medical center front desk helping support more than 400 patients and medical staff weekly.   Once again my life took and unexpected turn; a recent check-up and biopsy revealed my cancer had returned. As a result  I began treatment for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and multiple tumors on March 21st  2019.  I will be out from work for two to three months and have no other means of income. Even with “good” health insurance  the staggering cost of cancer treatments  labs  scans  co-pays  co-insurance  transportation  lodging  prescriptions  along with two months of regular living expenses will total more than $15 000.While I know I need to focus what little energy I have on enduring the horrible side effects of this cancer treatment and staying positive and strong in the face of this disease  I am instead consumed by worries and fears of whether I will be able to financially survive this illness.  It is for this reason I am reaching out for financial support.I greatly appreciate any help you can offer at this time. My hope is to be able to return in a few months to doing what I love most  making a positive difference in the lives of others through my work in healthcare.With Love  Gratitude  and Blessings to you Lisa"

He is one of the most caring and compassionate people I know. David has always gone above and beyond to help others. David has always struggled with medical issues. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was 13 years old and  due to this  had brain surgery. David has struggled with neuromuscular issues and chronic pain throughout his life. He has been to several specialists and finally  about three years ago  David was given a definitive diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome.You may be wondering  “What is Stiff Person Syndrome?”Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare  progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system  specifically the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms may include extreme muscle stiffness  rigidity and painful spasms in the trunk and limbs  severely impairing mobility. Spasms can generate enough force to fracture bone. https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5023/stiff-person-syndromeSince SPS is so rare  there aren’t any organizations dedicated to fundraising or support. SPS is progressive in nature and David will continue to deteriorate as he gets older. David currently struggles with completing everyday tasks like using the stairs  carrying items  picking up items and getting up from a seated position. David has very intense sleep cycles  which cause him to fall asleep easily and be difficult to wake. David has slept through smoke detector alarms before  which I am sure you can agree is a very scary situation. There are not many treatment options for the condition. David was receiving a treatment multiple times per week through IV injections but unfortunately developed severe side effects last year  which caused him to need hospitalization. David takes several medications daily to help manage the condition but none of them will help reverse the condition or help him live a normal life. One thing that would help is a Service Dog. A service dog would allow David to maintain his independence and provide him with companionship. David has been a dog lover for many years and he grew up with dogs. The service dog will be trained to assist David with his needs and help him to continue to live independently. David is connected with a local training organization to ensure that the dog is properly training to assist David with his needs and become the quintessential service dog.Unfortunately  service dogs aren’t covered by health insurance and to properly train a service dog can cost upwards of $30 000. David has already been looking at potential matches through local rescue organizations. The optimal companion would be an adult large breed dog around 2 years old.  We are hoping to help David with some of these costs so we can make this a reality for him.Thank you for all of your support!"

Tim is a father of two  and husband of Sandi. He has a loving grandson  who he would love more than anything to take on the baseball diamond. He is the proprietor of Love That Music! in Kernersville  North Carolina and has been a staple of the Kernersville community for over a decade. Tim has been active in the Kernersville community  sponsoring music at the Factory  local venues  and annually for the Spring Folly since 2008. After a recent major setback we are trying to raise funds for a hip replacement.            For a couple years Tim has been diagnosed with End Stage Avascular Necrosis of the Right Hip (bit.ly/AVNecrosis) the damage has gone untreated and is progressing into the left hip. As the disease has progressed  the pain has worsened greatly  and all the joint cartilage has worn away  leaving a highly painful bone-on-bone condition that makes it difficult for him to walk and perform even the simplest tasks.  At this point  too the grinding of bone on bone his right leg is over a full inch shorter than his left. This has caused compensation in his gait causing degenerative cartilage damage in his right knee that also needs repair. As many know and have seen  he has been experiencing degenerative symptoms for near half a decade or more. Since 2013 dad has been without health insurance.In May  2018 he went to see a local orthopedic surgeon in Kernersville.  Upon examination of his x-rays the surgeon exclaimed “That’s terrible! How do you walk?”  The surgeon commented that the disease had progressed to end-stage  and that joint breakage was a high possibility.  The surgeon informed dad at that time that he and Novant Health partnered with a national charity organization called Operation Walk USA.  The doctor also informed that he was Novant’s representative to the charity and that he needed a candidate to put forward for 2018. The doctor took one look at dad’s X-Rays and upon seeing the severity of the decay  told him “you’re my candidate this year.”  Surgery was scheduled for the week of December 3  2018  and in the words of the surgeon “if you make it until December”. Dad was referred to the office manager  emails and cell phone numbers were exchanged  and the process toward a hip replacement appeared to be initiating.  However  after two months only silence was received from Novant. Dad followed up with Novant  finally to be informed that Novant would not be participating with the charity due to “all the sign-offs required from the higher-ups\". This was a devastating blow to the family having the solution ripped from our hands. This was ultimately the last straw as all hope for getting back to mobility seemed to be fading quickly.Since this turn of events dad has resorted to using a cane to assist walking. Most days at the store are more than he can bare. Facing pain that would make normal men weep  he refuses to take strong painkillers  only on a strict regimen of Ibuprofen to help take the edge off. However  despite this  he can barely climb into most any car to drive. On long drives the pain causes him to pull over so he can stretch out. These are things most folks do not see when they come into the store because he is hell-bent on keeping things normal.The money from this fundraiser will go to helping replace Tim’s hip. Right now he is in contact with the Costa Rica Medical Tourism board. This is a JCI recognized hospital specializing in procedures such as this. The cost is lower  thus more feasible for folks in situations. (A lot of employers have started sending their folks here for services too) Any surplus funds will be used for sending a helper (one of kids) with him as proxy in case god-forbid that is needed. Anything beyond that will be used either for knee surgery OR to help pay it forward to someone else in need.We just all want to see Tim back on his feet and your help either in sharing or contributing is the blessing we need!"

Decidieron operarlo de emergencia  puesto que las consecuencias podían ser graves y no garantizaban que volviera a caminar.

God blessed us with three beautiful children  David  Daniel  and Dominique. Our life had a drastic and dramatic change on September 17  2018 because that day we took my husband to hospital with a severe medical emergency. He had not been able to walk for seven days and could not do his necessary physiological functions. We thought that it was a simple spinal hernia but the results were something we could not even imagine; a cancer nodule that was pressing on his spine. The root of the problem was a metastasized prostate cancer that made the situation even worse. The hospital immediately decided to take him to operation table because things were getting worse and they couldn't even assure he would walk again. Three months has passed and I have seen how God is working his miracles in my husband’s life. His legs have been recuperating and the medical treatments have progressed and his doctor has been stunned with the case. We need to know God has been doing what he does best. Due to how severe his legs were his legs are not still at 100% and his legs don’t allow him to work. Yet thanks to the support and help from our family  friends  and all of you that God has led you to help us and join us in the process of healing. I trust in God and know that this cancer will be completely healed. God will restore our lives and happily move forward  working for and serving God. We need $10 000 for his treatment that is not covered by our health insurance and living expenses that his disease brings. Thousand of thanks for blessing us and I want God to multiply whatever donation you give."

His doctor diagnosed it as an infection and prescribed antibiotics several times with no positive results.      Eventually Kevin was referred to an oral surgeon who performed a biopsy of what had tripled in size. The biopsy was sent to the Mayo Clinic and Kevin was referred to Dartmouth Hitchcock. It was there where the lump in his mouth was diagnosed as Osteosarcoma (bone cancer)     The tumor in his upper jaw is very aggressive and is considered life threatening if left untreated. The first step for treatment will be a potentially life threatening 8-10 hour surgery on Dec 19th to remove the tumor which will include part of his upper jaw  top teeth and a portion of his nose. He will then require bone grafts  plastic surgery skin grafts and new teeth along with speech therapy. All of which will be very expensive and not all covered by health insurance. We won't know until after this first surgery if Kevin will require chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment or further surgeries.     Kevin has a great support system of family and friends in place and is doing his best to stay positive. We as a family are all praying for a positive outcome from surgery and as speedy a recovery as possible. I'm asking of my family and friends to please share this post or donate anything you can to help cover medical bills  his stay in a rehab facility  homecare etc. Please pray for my son during this difficult time.Thank you Sandy Russell"

The next day  Tamekia had her appointment with her oncologist. At this appointment  a mass was discovered on Tamekia's right lung. A chest scan was conducted which led to an MRI of her brain. A body PET/CT scan soon followed which confirmed the presence of the mass  but also indicated her lymph nodes as additional areas of concern  and pointed to a \"hot spot\" on the right side of her tail bone. A bone biopsy was performed on Monday  October 30  2018. The following Monday  November 5  2018   Tamekia and her husband met with her oncologist to discuss the biopsy report. Her oncologist informed them that the results of the biopsy were not good  concluding with a diagnosis Tamekia was not expecting  Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. Shortly thereafter  Tamekia began an extremely aggressive treatment plan. This plan includes daily chemotherapy medications and monthly bone and ovarian suppression injections. In addition to the medication and injections  Tamekia will need future tests and scans to be performed in order to monitor the progress of the treatments and the growth of the tumors.  Tamekia is provided top-notch health insurance by her employer  but even so there are co-pays  deductibles  and some treatments that just aren't covered. As of Monday November 12  2018  Tamekia has incurred approximately $10 336.39 in medical costs and expenses.  These costs and expenses are only Tamekia's initial expenses to begin her  aggressive treatment plan prescribed by her oncologist.  In addition to this enormous medical bill  Tamekia is on an all organic - no carb/sugar diet. Tamekia is currently scheduled to have more tests performed in the upcoming days/weeks so that her oncologist can decide on the best method for surgical procedures needed regarding her right lung  right ovary  right breast  and right side of her tail bone. It is Tamekia's understanding that she can only be treated for the cancer on the right side of her tail bone which should keep it from spreading. Even though Tamekia has met her medical insurance deductible for the year  she still is responsible for the $10 336.39  in addition to all other daily medical expenses and lifestyle changes due to her recent diagnosis. Tamekia's medical insurance year will start over on June 1  2019  which will cause Tamekia’s co-payments for prescription medications to then cost anywhere from $300.00 - $1 200.00 until she meets her yearly deductible.  Tamekia's friends and extended family  along with her children  husband  mom  and brothers are asking for your thoughts  prayers  and any financial support you can offer to assist them during this difficult time. Please feel free to use this website to donate and help Tamekia and her family with her current and forthcoming medical bills  costs  and expenses.

There is no cure for this cancer and the odds of him beating chemotherapy and radiation are good with a 2-5 year survival rate; we know with the great doctors we have at the West Michigan Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic - we're going to with God's help surpass that. Shane was told that we needed to start aggressive chemotherapy and radiation immediately as this is aggressive which is what we are starting next week (November 13th) with our Cancer Center.  He is looking at having to go to U of M every 6 weeks spending 3 days there rotating with spending 3 days at another clinic for radiation.As of last month Shane had to leave his employer due to chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  Health insurance did not cover 90% of the local emergency room visits nor the extra fees of treatments or the physician. Our insurance did not cover a week's worth of treatments at the Mayo Clinic in MN either and now we are facing treatments of chemo and radiation - again - not covered.We learned that because Shane did not have short or long term disability - he doesn't qualify for anything.  The Unemployment Agency told us that he won't be able to qualify for Unemployment either because the State of Michigan has requirements that he MUST go look for employment while he is claiming. This is something that Shane can't do because he will be in chemo and/or radiation 3 days straight - I'm not much on asking for help; but as his wife I run an in home child care full time; and well there just isn't much there to help pay these bills.  We know that the bills are going to pile up and with my husband not being able to collect Social Security  or SSI disability there is no way to pay these medical bills. We're pleading with everyone - if you know of any organizations to help with medical bills  or if you can help in anyway - we'd so appreciate it more than you know.  All monies collected will go directly to the medical facility or provider and we will gladly provide proof of this if needed.Again - thank you for taking the time to read this -"

It’s not easy. And it takes a strong woman to do it. Out of the blue in the middle of March  Rachael ruptured her achilles tendon. As a solo entrepreneur in the yoga and paddle board business  this is a devastating injury. In summer 2018  Rachael found out she had invasive malignant melanoma  and with grace and patience she navigated surgery and mounting medical bills - despite not having health insurance.Rach has a long road ahead: Surgery  4-6 months of recovery time  and physical therapy.  She is committed to continuing to employ local yoga teachers to run classes for the community. After kicking cancer at 30  this is a rough follow up. It feels like insurmountable challenge - but none of us have to go it alone.

If you can't donate  you can still help! Please share!**** BELOW is Rachael’s STORYI bought a longboard skateboard thinking it would be another fun way to cruise around my beautiful island and be active outside. I used to have one back in college and it was always so fun and freeing to cruise around campus. I’m also just a sucker for boardsports... it’s sorta my passion. I got my shiney new longboard and took it out for her first cruise. The roads were a little slick cause it had been raining earlier. But I was too excited to notice. I’m loving my board and cruising around  next thing you know I take a misstep off the front  and the nose of the board crashes into the back of my ankle. It wasn’t a gnarly wipeout just a huge crack and pop noise as the board slammed into my ankle. I keeled over in pain... unsure if I could walk back to my house. I made it back  hobbling with tears in my eyes. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. But when I got back to my house  I laid on my bed in fetal position and sobbed loudly. The pain was unreal. I debated going to the doctors or not because I don’t have health insurance and I didn’t want to spend a few hundred bucks to be told to ice and elevate my foot which is what I was already doing. A few people told me not to waste my time  if I tore something it’d be more black and blue or I’d be in more pain. I did some research and performed some reflex tests on my calf and ankle. I started feeling the back of my leg  foot  and ankle. Comparing one to the other. As I followed the big thick tendon that moves from your heal to calf (Achilles tendon) mine stopped. And it felt almost like there was a hole there. My research told me that the worst case scenario for an injury like this was that my tendon had ruptured and that I would need surgery. I listened to my intuition  made an appointment directly with an orthopedic doctor and he confirmed my self diagnosis. My Achilles’ tendon had ruptured. I need surgery. As I sat there tears began to fall down my face. 5 minutes before I had explained to him that I run a paddleboard business and just opened a yoga studio space and that my whole world- work  passion  and play all revolve around being active and using my legs. As he was explaining to me the pros and cons of surgery and that I’d be off the water and out of the studio for the next 6 months... I couldn’t stop the tears. He was so kind  and looked me in the eyes and told me I’d get through this. He had so much empathy... what a miracle I happened to get him as my doctor. So I cried and he held my hand and we let it sink in for a few moments. Then off I went to get a cast  simultaneously receiving so much information about what my life would be like the next 6 months I felt dizzy. All I could think of was-  I cant work for 6 months. I don’t have health insurance. How on earth am I going to get through this and not end up living under a bridge. Between the MRI and doctors consult and cast  I’m already out hundreds and hundreds of dollars. The surgery and the necessary physical therapy I need  will cost thousands and thousands of dollars. I’m a single  self-employed woman. The monthly cost for me to have health insurance is astronomically high. I thought that after all I’d overcome last year... that there was no way I’d have another crazy medical emergency... I was wrong. Life is so unexpected! Last Year- 2018:8 months ago  after listening to my intuition that a spot on my body looked funny  I visited a dermatologist and was diagnosed with invasive malignant melanoma. A very aggressive and fast moving cancer. My tumor was a level 3 out of 5 in depth and was growing at an alarming rate. They took a big chunk of my stomach out along with the tumor and sewed me back up with over thirty stiches. My doctor told me that had I waited just 3 more months we would have been singing a completely different tune. I had caught my cancer just before it could compromise my lymphatic system and travel to other parts of my body. I got lucky. I caught it. And they got it. I’m still making monthly payments toward my medical expenses and surgery for kicking melanomas butt. Cancer stuff isn’t cheap when you pay out of pocket. Three months after I healed from my cancer journey  I stepped on an oyster bed and gashed my foot open. There was serious concern regarding infection and I went through three rounds of antibiotics along with getting ten stiches in my foot. Off the water and unable to do the work I love... again. I was sad  but it was only a minor setback. A couple weeks... I could deal.But this.... 6 months. 180 days of not being able to do the things I love most. One half of a year. It breaks my heart. I know I’m here on this earth to do the work I’m doing. I know that I will learn and grow in so many ways I cant even imagine over these next few months. But I’m devastated I can’t get out there and interact  guide  and teach. Because it brings me SO much joy. I will stay strong and positive  but I know that I cannot endure this journey alone. I will need help. I will need to lean on others. I will need to call upon family and friends.  I’m open and grateful for any support and help I’m fortunate enough to receive. MUCH LOVE"

The family rushed to his side at the Mayo Clinic in Lacrosse  WI from across the country in time for him to wake up from the brain surgery to remove the mass. Unfortunately  our worst fears were realized and then some as the mass was not only not benign  but was a rare  and the most aggressive form of brain cancer  a Glioblastoma. This particularly heinous form of cancer likely wasn't even there 3 months ago when Marc started getting persistent headaches  which illustrates how rapid this sort of tumor can develop. The skilled doctors at the Mayo Clinic removed what they could  but were unable to remove it all due to the nature of the disease and unfortunately he has been diagnosed as terminally ill. We'll get to his story in a bit  but first a bit more context of the scenario. Marc recently changed jobs and unfortunately had a lapse in health insurance coverage. His seizure took place on 27 March 2019 followed shortly by subsequent surgery and oncology appointments in the next couple of days. In a cruel twist of fate  his insurance coverage started on 1 April 2019  too late to save him from the astronomical prices of that level of care. In spite of his new company’s efforts to help him out  they were unable to get him covered by the insurance company  and now as he is unable to work  he doesn't have health insurance at all. We have applied for Medicare  and Social Security Disability insurance  however that only amounts to a pittance of the total costs accrued. Now onto the man that Marc himself is  and the legacy he must unfortunately leave behind too soon. He immigrated from Argentina accompanied by his sister and parents seeking asylum from political unrest at the time and  out of gratitude for the country who helped save him  he joined the Marine Corps where he served active duty from 1977 to 1981 and continued with the reserve unit until 1993.  After the Corps  he studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Northern Iowa and continued that line of work till his seizure. He also raised 8 children  including biological  adopted  and step-children. He instilled a sense of duty to his children and three of us are veterans as well. He is also a proud grandfather of three beautiful girls and two energetic boys. This is where  we hope  you can help. We come to you  hat in hand  asking for any support you can manage to make things easier for our family financially as we struggle to shoulder this unimaginable burden. The uninsured medical bills feel insurmountable at a time when the situation even with full insurance coverage would itself feel insurmountable. All contributions will go 100% to medical bills  cost of living  and end of life care. If you choose to help out  thank you very much for your contribution  no matter how much. Words cannot adequately express our gratitude for your compassion and it is a debt we fear we could never repay. If you chose not to  or otherwise cannot help  thank you for taking the time to read this far and please do not ignore persistent headaches. Semper Fi! If you are unable to donate please share this page with everyone you know and if there is any other way you can help please contact me. More info about the Glioblastoma cancer:   https://www.abta.org/tumor_types/glioblastoma-gbm/"

Dana would always pretend she was the mother of twins. Her childhood dreams were about to come true...Dana and her husband  Andrew  were expecting twins! Dana's pregnancy was going beautifully and on October 20th at 20 weeks pregnant the news came in that she and her husband would be having a boy and a girl who were due to arrival on March 12  2019. Just two short weeks later on November 4th  Dana and Andrew received the devastating news th￼at her pregnancy had taken a turn for the worse and Dana was at risk of going into pre-term labor at any given moment and possibly losing the twins. On December 1st after being in utero for only 25 weeks and 4 days  Andrew Vincent and Victoria Hope Meredith were welcomed into this world. Andrew was born first  weighing in at 1lb 4ozs  Victoria was born shortly thereafter via c-section  weighing in at 1lb 5ozs. Thankfully both tiny perfect little angels were born breathing on their own  and only requiring a cpap machine to help them. These little chickens as they are lovingly referred to are about to be 3 weeks old and are doing amazingly well despite their tiny statures. Since Andrew and Victoria decided to come so early and are considered mirco-preemies they are going to be in the NICU for months to come. Dana and Andrew do have health insurance coverage for these little ones but the co-payments x 2 will be extensive. Dana is a school teacher and has devoted her life to give all that she is to her students. She is one of the most loving and genuinely caring individuals I have ever been blessed to have in my life and her husband is just as loving and caring as she is. You honestly could not ask for better people to raise these precious little babies. I am hoping with your love and support for this beautiful family  we can help alleviate some of the financial strain they are facing so they can focus on loving their babies and watching them grow and get healthy enough to come home. All proceeds from this fundraiser will go directly to cover the twins medical costs. Any additional proceeds will be given as a donation in the twins honor to the hospital they are currently calling home to help other struggling families in a similar situation. Thank you so much for your love  prayers and support!!"

Because of the type of health insurance he has and the high co-pay  the rehab place couldn’t take him so they sent him home with a visiting nurse.  He couldn’t be evaluated at the VA Hospital for two weeks.  With the assistance of a Senator Dan Kildee’s representative and Saginaw County Commissioner Chuck Stack (also a Veteran)  Jack was able to get in to be evaluated faster.  Within 10 minutes of his evaluation they knew he needed to be admitted.  The VA admitted him.Mari and Kyle brought Jack home for two days  for Christmas where they enjoyed family traditions including Kyle reading The Christmas Story.  Upon returning Jack to the VA  he had a stroke and was immediately taken to Covenant Hospital.Tests were performed and no blood was detected on the brain. Jack had surgery to repair a hole in his heart.  When Jack came out of surgery he was far worse than when he went in.  He couldn’t move his left side  couldn’t speak or walk plus he was not dealing well mentally.  The next day they performed another surgery to insert a feeding tube.  Jack was not getting better and Covenant was going to send him back to the VA.  With help and many phone calls  HealthSource seen that this Veteran needed rehab and agreed to admit him.  Now that Jack is at HealthSource he is improving.  He has a long road ahead of him.  Jack loves the staff and is getting good care.  Jack successfully took his first steps the other day!  THIS SOLDIER NEVER QUITS!Jack knows what he’s going thru is hard on his family and he wants to get better so he can take care of them instead of the other way around.  He has NOT given up.

The only treatment available is to have her football-sized liver removed and replaced with a donor’s liver  either living or deceased.  Susie has been on the donor list for a new liver since November 2017.  The disease has greatly impacted her quality of life over the last decade  but we’re extremely hopeful that 2019 will be the year where Susie receives the long-awaited call from the Mayo Clinic for her liver transplant.In the spring of 2018  I volunteered to be Susie’s living liver donor.  I’ve known Susie since our freshman year of high school (1984 a.k.a. loooong ago!)  and while there’s been miles and years between us  we’ve maintained a genuine and lasting friendship. When I heard what she was enduring  I couldn’t help to think how healthy and fortunate I’ve been in my 48+ years of life  and I greatly wanted to make an impact and help restore her back to health.  My blood type was a match – so I headed to the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale to undergo the psychological and medical evaluations.  Unfortunately  my anatomy wasn’t favorable for a liver donor surgery.  We were both crushed  but held faith that another liver would present itself.  As Susie continues to climb the donor list  so do her medical bills! Even with decent health insurance  there are deductibles  co-pays and unforeseen expenses.  Since I was unable to donate part of my liver to my dear friend  I am on a mission to raise funds for Susie’s continual medical expenses.  Every penny will be helpful as Susie will have ongoing medical bills for the rest of her life.  Thank you in advance for your generosity and concern ~ monetary assistance and/or prayers are greatly appreciated."

My friend Janie is that person! I met Janie over 20 years ago. We met while working in dentistry together  when she was a dental assistant. She was the one who  when you go the dentist scared to death  she greets you in an upbeat manner. She holds your hand  patiently answers all the questions you have and would call you that evening to see how you were doing. Her “calling” in life was caring for people who she called “Her” patients. Anyone who worked with her knew she loved her job  it truly was a calling for her.     Fast forward 20 years later and Janie has advanced her way through the dental field by becoming a Consultant for dentists and their teams  helping them master what she was so good at. She directly had an impact on dental practices and the high quality care they delivered to their patients.      In May  my friend Janie received some devastating news. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. Over the summer months she completed her surgeries in addition to 6 weeks of daily radiation treatments. Which means she has not been able to work for over 6 months. In November she went back to the doctor for a follow up (hopefully an “all clear”) she was hit with some unbelievable news yet again. A large cyst which was there 6 months ago was completely gone  however it was hiding something very suspicious behind it that the doctors didn’t see before  possibility of more cancer. She may have to go through this entire process ALL OVER AGAIN.     Janie’s health insurance only covers 50-80% of all of these procedures  surgeries  doctor’s visits  scans  tests and 5 years’ worth of chemotherapy medications. The amount to date is staggering.      Janie is just now able to start back to work. She is a single parent household who has two teenaged children who rely on her. One who is in her first year of college and tuition is due twice a year…and the other who has medical issues  frequent specialist visits  along with very expensive monthly medications. Being able to keep up with the monthly household bills and also have the fear of losing everything  including her home  and what she has spent the last 10 years building is extremely difficult.      Janie is a very proud and independent person. I am writing this letter as a way to ask for her to get help. Janie has always given to anyone in need even if that meant she had to go without. She donates to many charities throughout the year and has even opened her home to friends who had no place to go. I know many of her friends and family have said  “let me know if there is anything I can do to help out”….I think this is where Janie now needs our help the most.Anything amount you can donate would be appreciated and would help with her increasing large bills.      Please help someone who has been a giver her entire life."

Derek told him to wait there and that he would come pick him up but Paul thought he was ok to drive home (15 min drive). Paul got home and was pulling into the garage but instead of hitting the break  he stepped on the gas and went into the dry wall of the house. No major damage took place to the house. Paul doesn't remember that happening at all. Derek came out of the house and put Paul in his car and took him to the West Bend clinic to get checked out. On their way to the clinic  Derek called Paul's wife  Sharen  who was at work at the time. She met them at the clinic and was there waiting with a wheelchair for Paul. As soon as Paul sat in the wheelchair  he had a major seizure. The clinic called the ambulance who took Paul to St. Josephs Hospital.  They did a CT scan and it showed no bleeding in the brain. They needed to wait until the next day to get a MRI. He did get an MRI which showed a small tumor on his brain. He did some more tests while he was in the hospital and was told by the doctors that he needed to schedule an appointment for surgery to remove the tumor. He went home and and Sharen called to schedule the surgery. On November 19  2018 he had is surgery. It was a very long day for him and the family. The surgery was successful and they were able to remove everything except the outer tissue of the tumor which would have caused a stroke if they removed that as well. He would be going through Radiation Therapy and Chemo Therapy treatments to try to kill those cell tissues that were unable to be removed from surgery. On to recovery! The day after Christmas December 26  2018  he started his chemo and radiation therapy. He needed to go to the St. Joes Hospital for his radiation therapy everyday Monday through Friday for 6 weeks. It seemed to be helping and he was getting better. On February 7  2019  he finished his chemo and radiation therapy! Soon after that he started feeling very tired and nauseous. The doctors said this was normal and it was the treatment finally catching up to him. On February 16-17  2019 Paul started falling quite a bit at home and he lost functionality in his right arm and leg. Paul was frustrated and Sharen was exhausted. Sharen decided to take Paul to the Memomonee Falls Community Hospital Emergency Room on February 18  2019. She wanted to get him checked out to make sure he didn't have a stroke due to his weakness in his right arm and leg. They got there around 11am. He was examined by the ER doctor and was told he needed an MRI. He got that but they couldn't see anything because his brain was so swollen. They decided to give him a more extensive MRI which would show more. They did that and after   they wanted him transferred to Freodert as soon as possible but there were no rooms available in the Neuro ICU. They put him on steroids to get the swelling to go down in his brain. Finally  around 8pm a room opened up at Freodert and an ambulance took him down. When they got to Freodert and got him settled into a room  the Neuro doctor came in to see him. He showed Sharen  Paul  and Sharen's sister  Karen (who is a nurse) the MRI images from before his first surgery and the images from the MRI he just got taken that day. The tumor size has doubled compared to the tumor size before his first surgery. On February 19  2019  they scheduled his surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible for Thursday February 21  2019 and are praying for success. After his surgery   the plan is to start a stronger form of Chemotherapy. His family is really going through a hard time with all of this. Those of you that know Paul  know him as a fun guy with a great sense of humor and a huge heart. After Paul retired from WE Energies  Sharen and Paul's health insurance has really gone downhill with what insurance is willing to contribute to all of these medical expenses. Please don't feel obligated to donate. If you would just like updates on how he is doing  those will be posted here."

I am 56 years old  married (to an awesome man  Jeff) and have two amazing children  A. J. and Scott. I also have a beautiful daughter-in-law  Hannah and the most precious grandson ever. I have family that is close to me and family that is far away that give me lots of moral support along with many friends  near and far.In 2007  after I had a lump removed from my left thigh  I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma or NHL is a blood type of cancer that is found in the lymph nodes and/or in the bone marrow.I underwent 20 radiation treatments at that time.All was good with the NHL being in remission  until 2014.In July of 2014  I went to the ER to have my leg checked out due to severe swelling.After many tests  I was diagnosed with Grade II Follicular Lymphoma. Follicular Lymphoma is a common type of NHL that is less evasive as other NHL lymphomas. I underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy. I came through the chemo treatments with flying colors. I felt great and was able to continue to work at both of my jobs throughout treatments.In January of 2015  I again went to the ER due to swelling and redness in the right side of my neck. After a CT scan  it was determined that I had formed a blood clot around the chemo port that was in my right-side shoulder area. They diagnosed me with DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and SVCS (Superior Vena Cava Syndrome). I underwent a surgery to help try and break up the blood clot. The surgery was some sort of a success  but it didn’t break up the blood clot totally. I was then put on a blood thinner for 3 months. After that 3 months  the blood clot was gone.In February of 2015  through at CT and a PET scan  they found a mass in my colon. I was then diagnosed with colon cancer. I had a colon resection done to remove the mass. They were able to get all of the mass but the cancer had metastasized to mesenteric lymph nodes. I then went through 6 more cycles of chemotherapy. Once again  I came through with flying colors and to this day  the colon cancer has not returned.In February of 2016  my left leg began to swell again so I went in for a CT and a PET scan. They found a lymph node that had grown in size since my last CT and PET scan. They did a biopsy of the lymph node and I was then diagnosed with Diffuse Large-B Cell Lymphoma. This type of NHL is the more aggressive type. It is fast growing as where the Follicular Lymphoma is slow growing.I went through 6 cycles of chemotherapy  in which I lost my hair and had some complications. During this time  I also lost my Father in April of 2016. This made it a little bit harder to get through  but I made it through  because I knew that is what he  my family and friends wanted me to do. My last treatment was in August of 2016.Everything was going well  my hair grew back  much thicker and curly this time. I wasn’t quite at 100%  but I was getting there. My CT and PET scans looked good up until November of 2018.In November of 2018  I went in for my 6 months checkup and CT scan. They found a mass in my left-side groin area. I went in for a surgical biopsy and it came back as Diffuse Large-B Cell Lymphoma  again.So  my plan of care and treatment will be different this time. I will be going through an Autologus Stem Cell Transplant in Omaha  NE. I have to get 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy here in Salina  then a PET scan and if everything is good  I will then travel to Omaha for the stem cell transplant. I will be there for about 5-6 weeks or longer. The first two weeks will be schooling on what to expect and a bunch of tests a long with the extraction of the stem cells. The next 3-4 weeks will be more chemotherapy and then the actual transplant. Once I am well enough to be discharged from the hospital  I will have to stay in the Omaha area for about 1-2 weeks. This is to make sure that the transplant was successful and that my immune system is working like it should.I am not one that likes to ask for help. I usually am the one to offer help when or if needed with whatever I can do. This whole process will put us (my husband and I) in a huge financial bind. As most people know  having health insurance does help  but it doesn’t always cover everything. As everyone also knows that because you have major health issues  life goes on  as does the bills  such as house payments and of course  the medical bills that the health insurance won’t cover.Any help would be so greatly appreciated  you have no idea!! If you can’t contribute  I totally understand. If you could say a prayer  that will make me just as happy. I’m a firm believer in prayers and have seen them work many times.Thank you all for reading my story and I apologize for it being so long and detailed. I wanted everyone to know the whole story.I have a moto:It’s Not About BraveryIt’s About Doing What I Need To DoBy Not Giving Up Or Giving InTo Win. Thank you again and may God bless you in so many ways!!"

"Medical","February 13, 2019","Myriad Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Woes for Cindy","$3,660","$3,000","31","2","31","","LONGBEACH","CA","Hello friends and considerate strangers. In the fall of 2014  Cindy was diagnosed with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)  and it came as quite a shock after a year of various tests to determine the cause of what included blurry vision  loss of balance/difficulty walking  fatigue  and extreme pain in her torso.However  this illness was not new to her as her mother was diagnosed with MS in spring 2008 and eventually passed away from complications of this disease five years later. Unlike her mother  though  from the start Cindy has doggedly fought to keep her quality of life. Despite this  various challenges have presented themselves in the past four years since being on her own after divorcing.Loss of work because of MS exacerbations during this period has led to her current financial need to cover medical expenses and housing costs. Her teaching position does not offer health insurance  and shouldering this burden on a part-time adjunct salary has drained her monetary reserves. To whittle her “life budget ” she recently moved into a room with a landlord that is proving to be unsuitable after only two months. She left this lodging on February 16  2019  and has been relying on the kindness of many to house and feed her as the arduous task of searching for an affordable room to rent in Southern California begins again.The medical bills will never stop as her MS has progressed within the past year bringing over 20 new lesions on both her brain and spinal cord. The new DMT (disease modifying treatment/therapy)  as well as other complementary treatments for her systemic scleroderma  eat up one-fourth of her yearly earnings. This has left her with little to afford the basics which include  at this point  food and housing. Again  she is extremely humbled and thankful to have had the help of a mighty army of friends that have assisted with these issues  especially in the past year.All Cindy wants to do is continue working as much as possible even though she has recently transitioned from teaching to only tutoring on her campus. Her hands can no longer grade papers for long stretches  and she is unable to stand in a stationary position for extended periods of time: Both are definitely necessary for an effective professor! Other physical issues that flare up from time-to-time include: decreased cognitive functioning  inability to drive long distances  continued torso pain  lack of vision in her right eye  and the co-morbid symptom of depression that plagues many of those with MS.In spite of all this  Cindy refuses to give up or give in because she saw what this inaction to fight brought for her mother. Cindy continues to jump the physical and psychological hurdles MS can bring in what she hopes is a dignified way. She has reached a point  though  where she is asking for even more helping hands so that she can get out from present medical bills and afford a decent place to live that will provide comfort and peace. She feels embarrassed to admit she needs this kind of help  and even if you have chosen to simply take the time to read her story  it is appreciated. Thank you  and may your life be full of as much joy and happiness as possible."

Insurance company is denying coverage of transport. PLEASE HELP! Marissa is fighting for her life. Her infections keep spreading and she is not healing. She is hospitalized  unable to work  unable to care for (and often unable to even visit ) her new preemie  and her situation is dire. Will you help?Some of you know her story. Many of you do not. Here is her story and our ask for help.Born at just 31 weeks gestation  Marissa came out fighting. She went on to develop into a beautiful  smart  talented  loving young girl. Then  at age 11  she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Being born a fighter  Marissa has endured a multitude of treatments  hospitalizations  medications  and battles over the past 10 years  and has worked hard to fight her disease.Fast forward to 2018. Marissa has spent about 9 weeks of the year in the hospital over the last six months. She worked when she could  but has been unable to work since October due to her health. She is a much-loved  hard-working pediatric dental assistant.Marissa got an infection this summer  and due to her weak immune system  fighting infections is difficult. And  because she learned she was growing a beautiful human inside her  treatment options became limited.Remember when I said that Marissa was born at 31 weeks gestation? Well  guess what! Her sweet little boy decided to come early like his mama! He was born on Christmas Eve 2018. While we celebrate this sweet baby’s birth and the excellent care he is receiving  we also rejoice in knowing that Marissa’s treatment options have increased now that her baby boy is out of the womb. Unfortunately  her infections continue to spread... Please join us in praying for Marissa and her sweet boy. She has health insurance (new year  new huge deductibles)  but the financial burden is taking a toll  and adding up quickly. Any assistance in this regard is greatly appreciated!MS is her disease  but it does not define her. Marissa continues to radiate love  gratitude  and joy in all that she does. Thank you!"

I am 56 years old  married (to an awesome man  Jeff) and have two amazing children  A. J. and Scott. I also have a beautiful daughter-in-law  Hannah and the most precious grandson ever. I have family that is close to me and family that is far away that give me lots of moral support along with many friends  near and far.In 2007  after I had a lump removed from my left thigh  I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma or NHL is a blood type of cancer that is found in the lymph nodes and/or in the bone marrow.I underwent 20 radiation treatments at that time.All was good with the NHL being in remission  until 2014.In July of 2014  I went to the ER to have my leg checked out due to severe swelling.After many tests  I was diagnosed with Grade II Follicular Lymphoma. Follicular Lymphoma is a common type of NHL that is less evasive as other NHL lymphomas. I underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy. I came through the chemo treatments with flying colors. I felt great and was able to continue to work at both of my jobs throughout treatments.In January of 2015  I again went to the ER due to swelling and redness in the right side of my neck. After a CT scan  it was determined that I had formed a blood clot around the chemo port that was in my right-side shoulder area. They diagnosed me with DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and SVCS (Superior Vena Cava Syndrome). I underwent a surgery to help try and break up the blood clot. The surgery was some sort of a success  but it didn’t break up the blood clot totally. I was then put on a blood thinner for 3 months. After that 3 months  the blood clot was gone.In February of 2015  through at CT and a PET scan  they found a mass in my colon. I was then diagnosed with colon cancer. I had a colon resection done to remove the mass. They were able to get all of the mass but the cancer had metastasized to mesenteric lymph nodes. I then went through 6 more cycles of chemotherapy. Once again  I came through with flying colors and to this day  the colon cancer has not returned.In February of 2016  my left leg began to swell again so I went in for a CT and a PET scan. They found a lymph node that had grown in size since my last CT and PET scan. They did a biopsy of the lymph node and I was then diagnosed with Diffuse Large-B Cell Lymphoma. This type of NHL is the more aggressive type. It is fast growing as where the Follicular Lymphoma is slow growing.I went through 6 cycles of chemotherapy  in which I lost my hair and had some complications. During this time  I also lost my Father in April of 2016. This made it a little bit harder to get through  but I made it through  because I knew that is what he  my family and friends wanted me to do. My last treatment was in August of 2016.Everything was going well  my hair grew back  much thicker and curly this time. I wasn’t quite at 100%  but I was getting there. My CT and PET scans looked good up until November of 2018.In November of 2018  I went in for my 6 months checkup and CT scan. They found a mass in my left-side groin area. I went in for a surgical biopsy and it came back as Diffuse Large-B Cell Lymphoma  again.So  my plan of care and treatment will be different this time. I will be going through an Autologus Stem Cell Transplant in Omaha  NE. I have to get 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy here in Salina  then a PET scan and if everything is good  I will then travel to Omaha for the stem cell transplant. I will be there for about 5-6 weeks or longer. The first two weeks will be schooling on what to expect and a bunch of tests a long with the extraction of the stem cells. The next 3-4 weeks will be more chemotherapy and then the actual transplant. Once I am well enough to be discharged from the hospital  I will have to stay in the Omaha area for about 1-2 weeks.

In October 2018 she was diagnosed with fibroids and began treatment  but when returning from a trip over Thanksgiving she required 4 transfusions and had to be hospitalized. Then  in November  Theryn was diagnosed with Stage 2b cervical cancer. Since then  she has started an aggressive treatment plan. The initial plan was for 25 radiation sessions and 5 chemotherapy sessions. Following that  4 internal radiation sessions are now added beginning mid-February. During the first internal radiation session  doctors will assess whether further chemotherapy and surgery are required.  We all know how strong she has been for others  but now she needs our support. With these treatments  Theryn has been accruing over $1k in medical expenses each week since the beginning of January (in addition to 2018 bills for the ER visit  a week-long hospital stay  and several consultations). She still has health insurance through her employer while on medical leave  but has spent over $1500 out of pocket so far--and it is still too early to tell how long she will be on leave from work. We anticipate that she will reach her out-of-pocket maximum for both 2018 and 2019. We want to ensure that Theryn isn't burdened by a lifetime of medical debt. Her other needs (transportation  meals  caregiving  and housing) are being met by a group of friends Theryn nicknamed Barbie’s Dream Team. Theryn’s spirits are good and you know she’s a fighter!  Please show your love and concern by donating today. Feel free to share her fundraiser with your contacts via email  social media  and in your social groups. Help us get our fighter back into action!"

After many different tests and procedures  the doctors determined the cancer was caught very early and she can start treatment before it spreads into other areas. A few weeks after discovering the cancer in her left breast  they found another mass in her right breast that her initial mammogram did not pick up and was discovered through one of her MRI scans. She will now have to go through all the same tests and procedures for the new mass and incur double the expenses.Her procedures so far have included multiple mammograms  ultrasounds  biopsies  MRI scans  and genetic testing. Many tests were repeated in order to ensure a correct diagnosis. Coming in the next few weeks  she will be having a partial mastectomy of her left breast and will go through at least five weeks of radiation therapy. Following that  they will continue following up with the left breast and begin making plans for the right breast.Our mom has been very brave and has had a positive outlook throughout it all but has felt extreme stress financially. She currently works over 50 hours a week to support her family. She is a single mother with four kids: Abby  Alex  Bryanna  and Aiden. Everyone who knows her  knows she is a selfless  loving person who would bend over backwards to make those around her happy.Although our mom does have health insurance  her deductible and out of pocket expenses are very high  at $10 000 each year. She has nearly met her $10 000 deductible for 2018 already  and it will automatically reset beginning 2019. After the deductible is met  the coverage that the insurance provides will only be a portion of the total cost of treatment. Our goal is to raise $30 000 to help limit her financial burden while she's also dealing with the emotional stresses of having a breast cancer diagnosis.We’re extremely hopeful that her treatments will work in getting rid of the cancer and are hoping to do anything we can to help her physically  emotionally  and financially. We're humbly asking for any donations; even $1  $5  anything  donated will be gratefully accepted by her daughters and put directly towards her medical bills. Please donate using the GoFundMe link or at her oldest daughter's Venmo account (@abbyniccole). Thank you so much! ***February 4th: hi everyone! i get a lot of questions about my mom and how she’s doing  so i wanted to give everyone a little update! her partial mastectomy went incredibly well  her doctor was able to remove all of the cancer and she recovered quickly. she begins radiation TODAY! originally she was scheduled for five weeks of radiation  monday-friday and thankfully that was reduced to only four weeks. please keep her in your thoughts and prayers today as she begins. we are hoping she feels peace and comfort during radiation  and minimal negative side effects and fatigue. again  a huge thank you to everyone who reaches out and especially those who have been able to donate to help her financially during this time. our go fund me/Venmo are still open and any donations or even sharing the post is so so dearly appreciated. thank you everyone!"

Don't ask me because I have no idea  but Dan probably knows. As some of you may know the morning of Christmas my dad had a heart attack. During this time they were able to place a stent that ultimately saved his life. He was put on medications to help the stent heal properly and was doing great. Two nights ago he was brought back by ambulance to the hospital because he was unfortunately not doing well. All of his heart issues are looking sound  but he was internally bleeding. This has caused him severe issues with his vitals. He's received a blood transfusion and has been underway quite a few tests etc. Lastnight he began bleeding more and was sent into a second round of cauterizations to hopefully stop all the internal bleeding and is currently in the intensive care unit.  He's in great spirts and is stable and being extremely well taken care of. My dad as many of you know is self employed and employs a few family members.. With my dad being in the hospital  he obviously is unable to work and not that it needs much explanation but we all know how expenses pile quickly. On top of it all  he does not have any health insurance something many self employed battle with. My dad is the first person to give it all  to anyone who needs it. He has an incredibly big heart and has a very hard time asking for help. (Which is why I'm doing this) any donations received will be going directly to my dad to help lift off the weight of this all. Medical bills  medications  loss of wages. Thank you so much for taking the time to click  even if you're unable to donate- The time out of your day for checking in on how he is doing is well appreciated."

One of the risks of this medication is the dangerous build up of protein in the organs  called Amyloidosis.  It is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does  it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.Dre was lucky enough to make it to the hospital in time to catch it back in September... but with such a rare disease that often affects the liver  nerves  heart  and kidneys  the medical bills for everything from diagnosis  to treatment  to after care  have been mounting to thousands of dollars.With all that Dre has done for the many people in his life  at home  at work  with his family  with his community and all with a smile  that scratchy laugh  and with a big heart  it only made sense for us to try and return the favor. Dre's health insurance will not be sufficient to cover everything that is needed to treat his condition. Some of the prescriptions alone will cost hundreds of dollars to fill.

She found the mysterious lump herself and went in right away to have it checked. The thrilling news is she caught it early and already feels “it” (she refuses to use the word Cancer and likes to refer to it as a “parasite”) is shrinking after undergoing three of the six rounds of chemotherapy. However  there is still a long way to go to complete this arduous regimen once she completes the chemotherapy. She will then be scheduled for surgery  radiation treatment  then a year of additional infusions over 2019. Ann-Marie  Roger  and Ethan have made this fight the primary focus of their lives. As you may imagine  it has taken an emotional  physical as well as financial toll.To help reduce the financial stress that might get in the way of her healing  we decided to create this campaign on their behalf.The Financial Challenges Ahead:As you can imagine  the medical expenses are starting to mount. Ann-Marie and Roger are facing two years’ of health insurance deductibles and premiums until she is able to return to work later in 2019. In addition  Ann-Marie has decided to fight her cancer using an integrative approach which means using methods and alternative therapies in addition to convention medicine. As a result  certain medications and supportive treatments are not covered by insurance. Also  Ann-Marie is unable to work during her treatments and it is not yet determined when she will be able to return to work in a full time capacity thus losing a significant portion of their household income. We have created this fund to help reduce the financial stress so that Ann-Marie and her family can focus on tackling her cancer and begin the healing journey. Any contribution you feel comfortable in making is deeply appreciated.If you have any questions  please feel free to contact either Kim Larson Sydnee Dreyer or myself at the addresses listed on the email you received. If you have any questions please feel free to contact either of us at the address listed on the email you received.  We encourage you to share this link with friends of the Ramseys.  https://www.gofundme.com/create/story/annmarie039s-healing-journey Lastly we wanted to share words from Ann-Marie that she posted on Facebook to express her gratitude to all of you for your well wishes  meals  visits  walks and general outpouring of support.  Please read aloud with a subtle Georgian lilt to get the full effect of her sweet  inimitable style!\"So I wanted to say THANK YOU for all the wonderful comments  thoughts  cards  and texts I've received from you all as a result of my \"parasite\" post!

She will be having surgery tomorrow to remove all 4 of the tumors. Much time time was wasted and the tumors have grown large  we are still holding on to hope.  Thank you for your continued prayers and support.Unfortunately some missteps took place in Mandy's treatment. A scan revealed that the chemo prescribed for her was not effective  the tumors have actually grown larger.  Two of the tumors have actually started to fuse together around her uterus. The teratomas themselves are not actually cancer  but can contain cancer  a pet scan did reveal that cancer is present in her body  but at this point we are uncertain of what type of cancer she even has.  We are venturing from Wichita to Kansas City  to KU Medical to seek new treatment options for her.  Surgery will be in her future to remove the 4 tumors. While presently she does have health insurance  but with the new year  meeting the deductible before insurance will cover starts over. As would be expected this whole experience has been horrific for her  and has turned her world upside down   the effects of chemo have been devastating and this journey is far from over for her. Mandy does not have any children of her own and this weighs on her mind as well. Mandy is very strong and brave and would be the last one that would want anyone to feel sorry for her.  She has now been out of work since October 2018   Asking for help is also incredibly hard and it has only been through the generous support that she has been able to stay on top of her bills.  Anything that you can donate would be greatly appreciated  please feel free to share this. We are still trusting and believe that miracles happen.Thank you so much for your prayers and support it means so much to us.We created this gofundme page to help support Mandy  as she is going through Cancer Treatments. Mandy has been out of work since October 2018 and presently has no income coming in  as she is not well enough to work  we are relying solely on the kindness and generosity of those who are able to donate to this fund.  Mandy's story does not differ that much than so many others who have been struck down with this horrible disease. She was this beautiful  young 32 year old who thought she had finally reached this place where she had her life pretty well figured out. She started a new career as a Postal Carrier  a job she loved because as she will admit  she loves to organize and sort things  so this was perfect for her.  She has a deep love for animals  particularly her fur baby Chester.  Plans included to one day go to London  New Zealand to take the Lord of the Rings Tour.  Mandy has an Art Degree and is a talented and gifted photographer  one of her favorite past-times is taking trips with her best friend Nancy to find unique out of the way places to photograph  it would be her dream to be a band photographer  but that's another story.Her whole life changed this past Spring  when stomach pains prompted a trip to the hospital  a volleyball sized mass was found surrounding her ovary. The word germ call Teratoma became embedded in our brains  at the time she was repeatedly assured that it is very rare for a Teratoma to be cancerous  roughly only 2% are  a surgery followed and she lost her ovary  the mass was sent to mayo clinic and while she was out delivering mail  her Surgeon called to tell her she had cancer. It was very devastating. She had a Pet Scan  that revealed no cancer present in her body and we rejoiced that this was behind us.  Until this past September when 4 new tumors were found  one by her other ovary  two in her uterus and one along the surgical line  that she can feel when she touches her stomach. Teratoma's are incredibly fast growing  so she was out put on an intense round of three types of Chemo  three cycles that consisted of one week of 5 days  followed by 1 day the next two weeks  and than the cycle begins again. It was the plan that this would shrink the tumors  making surgery less invasive  unfortunately that didn't happen  the tumors did not shrink but actually have grown. The Chemo has left Mandy incredibly weak  a good day is when Mandy can walk on her own  most days she is transported by wheel chair. She misses her life  her friends  she holds on to her hope that she won't lose her other ovary and that one day she will have a child.I truly know and believe that Mandy will come through this  she is strong  brave and determined. This experience has softened her heart even more to those around her  she has a great desire to help others  to make a difference  to let others know that they are not alone in this journey. We ask please  more than anything for your prayers  we know that God has an amazing plan for Mandy's life  He makes beauty from ashes  she will come through this and have such an amazing story to share  one of strength  bravery  will power and such amazing love. We continue to stand on His promises  that despite what the scans show  by His Stripes she is healed. We thank you so much for your generous support any amount can help and we are so very grateful  for your prayers  we truly believe that God will place the right people in her path to help her.Thank you from all of us  her friends and familyMay God bless you"

I am just trying to do something proactive to help them. All the details of their situation are below. Thank you!This is a hard story to tell. My parents are private people and watching how their lives have changed these last couple years has finally made me get up and do something to help them. I am originally from America  where my parents and brother live  but I currently reside in England with my husband and three children. Being so far away has been really hard for me and I have been trying to find the words to sympathetically retell a story  or better yet a nightmare  that struck home 3 years ago.Some family and friends that are close to us may find this hard to read as not a lot of people have been privy to the details. My little brother  Carter  who is now almost  19 years old  has been diagnosed with a rare syndrome that has only been recently making headlines. PANDAS or now known as PANS syndrome is an acronym for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infection. It’s an infection that eventually travelled to his brain after having a Strep A infection when he was 16 years old.  There isn’t a lot of research and there is still so much more to understand as this diagnosis is more common in preadolescence boys  not mature 16 year olds. But this is what happened to my family. Carter has been for most of his life a very happy  content  smart  athletic child. Kind didn’t even begin to describe his nature. He was a stand up boy and loved life! He was funny and mature for his age so he knew how to get along with anyone. He was the favourite babysitter at our Church  he worked hard  played hard and saved hard. Carter has always been a perfectionist. He was my parent’s miracle baby (my Mom suffered 3 miscarriages and 2 stillbirths in between my other brother and Carter) and lived up to that title. He had dreams of being in the FBI by the time he was 30!In 2016  after having a severe bout of Strep twice  my brother’s attitudes and personality completely changed. What felt like overnight  Carter was someone my parents didn’t recognize. He was lethargic  anxious  unable to cope with a normal day. It took several months for my Mom to get a doctor to listen to them and understand that this was something entirely different than the usual teenage anxiety. Eventually a blood workup was done and the diagnose was PANDAS. As he was already coming out of puberty  doctors were not sure what the future held for Carter. Would he be “normal” again? Would he be able to go to school? Would he even be able to enjoy simple every day things? Every day was a challenge for my Mom and Dad  trying to understand where their beautiful boy went. He didn’t talk to my parents  he wouldn’t come out of his room  he began to hate himself  argue with everyone and he struggled to deal with how he felt. He often would say “I have so much pain and I don’t know where it’s coming from. I just want it to go away.” Carter missed his entire Junior year of High School where he was once in the top of his class. He lost a lot of friends as so many didn’t understand what he was going through. After a year  a lot of hard core antibiotics  medications  therapy and diet changes my parents saw little glimmers of hope in Carter. He went back to school his Senior year. He still didn’t attend very often but was given permission to complete his work at home. He had to accomplish so much to complete 2 full school years in one year as he really wanted to graduate with his class.  He did it. He actually did it by the skin of his teeth. Three days before Graduation Carter was told he was going to graduate. What a relief! However  the problems didn’t stop there. The pressure from that year weighed heavy on Carter and he struggled to continue to cope with everyday life. Unfortunately  the same summer Carter graduated (June 2018) my parents lost both of their jobs. Leaving them with no insurance to keep Carter in the therapy or the extensive amount of medications he needed. Which lead to him spiraling out of control again. Last month I received a horrible phone call very early in the morning. My brother tried to take his own life. He didn’t like who he had become and didn’t want to suffer any longer. After attending the ER  he was taken by ambulance to an Adult Psychiatric Centre where he stayed for 4 days. My brother was alive  but just as broken. My parents have had to move home and areas to try and give Carter a fresh start. The care for his medical bills is once again stacking up as my parents have no way to pay for the hospital care and ambulance. They have been out of jobs for nearly 6 months and are looking at other options. My Dad spends most of his days applying for jobs where he has had several first and second interviews with nothing coming of them. My Mom has fortunately been recommended for a position in a large business and they have hired her! However  she hasn’t started yet and although they will be able to have good Health Insurance through her new job soon  it will not cover any medical costs retrospectively. I have wanted to fly over and help where I can  but that also is a price we can’t afford. I just want to give them a little bit of help. I want to show them and Carter that the world does care and that they are loved. My family have always attended Church  believed in God and that all things happen for a reason. But I feel for so much of their life  they’ve never been given a break. Carter isn’t himself and may not ever be the social young man he once was. But I know with a little bit of financial help  they can find the right therapy for him and make his life more tolerable. He would like to be able to attend VCU and go into their Pharmacy program to be able to get in from the ground up with up and coming medications. But that dream seems so far away right now. I love him so much. He will always be my baby brother. Please help! I wanted Go Fund Me to give them a fresh start and some help and while this account is active  I will also be doing some fundraising of my own here in England. So watch this space. Thank you!"

One of the risks of this medication is the dangerous build up of protein in the organs  called Amyloidosis.  It is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does  it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.Dre was lucky enough to make it to the hospital in time to catch it back in September... but with such a rare disease that often affects the liver  nerves  heart  and kidneys  the medical bills for everything from diagnosis  to treatment  to after care  have been mounting to thousands of dollars.With all that Dre has done for the many people in his life  at home  at work  with his family  with his community and all with a smile  that scratchy laugh  and with a big heart  it only made sense for us to try and return the favor. Dre's health insurance will not be sufficient to cover everything that is needed to treat his condition. Some of the prescriptions alone will cost hundreds of dollars to fill. His best chance at fighting this condition is at Mayo Clinic  seeing the best doctors that can provide the care and treatment to give him the best chance of beating this. And those tests  treatments  and doctors visits are averaging $1000 or more each.If Andre has ever helped you out in a jam  made you dance with his DJ skills  cracked you up laughing with jokes  or went of his way to make sure \"You good? You know I got you.\" as he often says to us all  then please consider donating to this GoFundMe fundraiser to help him get through this time. And to let him know that \"We got him\" this time."

She found the mysterious lump herself and went in right away to have it checked. The thrilling news is she caught it early and already feels “it” (she refuses to use the word Cancer and likes to refer to it as a “parasite”) is shrinking after undergoing three of the six rounds of chemotherapy. However  there is still a long way to go to complete this arduous regimen once she completes the chemotherapy. She will then be scheduled for surgery  radiation treatment  then a year of additional infusions over 2019. Ann-Marie  Roger  and Ethan have made this fight the primary focus of their lives. As you may imagine  it has taken an emotional  physical as well as financial toll.To help reduce the financial stress that might get in the way of her healing  we decided to create this campaign on their behalf.The Financial Challenges Ahead:As you can imagine  the medical expenses are starting to mount. Ann-Marie and Roger are facing two years’ of health insurance deductibles and premiums until she is able to return to work later in 2019. In addition  Ann-Marie has decided to fight her cancer using an integrative approach which means using methods and alternative therapies in addition to convention medicine. As a result  certain medications and supportive treatments are not covered by insurance. Also  Ann-Marie is unable to work during her treatments and it is not yet determined when she will be able to return to work in a full time capacity thus losing a significant portion of their household income. We have created this fund to help reduce the financial stress so that Ann-Marie and her family can focus on tackling her cancer and begin the healing journey. Any contribution you feel comfortable in making is deeply appreciated.If you have any questions  please feel free to contact either Kim Larson Sydnee Dreyer or myself at the addresses listed on the email you received. If you have any questions please feel free to contact either of us at the address listed on the email you received.  We encourage you to share this link with friends of the Ramseys.  https://www.gofundme.com/create/story/annmarie039s-healing-journey Lastly we wanted to share words from Ann-Marie that she posted on Facebook to express her gratitude to all of you for your well wishes  meals  visits  walks and general outpouring of support.  Please read aloud with a subtle Georgian lilt to get the full effect of her sweet  inimitable style!\"So I wanted to say THANK YOU for all the wonderful comments  thoughts  cards  and texts I've received from you all as a result of my \"parasite\" post! I tell ya  as the superfluous layers have fallen away in this process  the fountain of gratitude has risen up! As nasty and crappy as this stuff is  it has really made me realize the preciousness of a day  each day  and the value of good friends and family  not to mention an amazing community of support to bring by meals  provide rides  help when I need it. It is truly humbling. I'm currently in my third round of chemo and am tolerating it pretty good despite some of the wretched side effects. I feel the parasite dying which makes it all worth it. That thing is going down  literally! Hoping each of you will have a wonderful and magical holiday season full of inspiration and love!\""

Ranny was first diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer in 2014 and underwent surgery and chemotherapy into 2015. Her past experience has made her very knowledgeable about her care and her needs during treatment. One of the therapies that Ranny found  and is proving to help her greatly  is Mistletoe.  Although newer to the US  the liquid extract of mistletoe has long been used in Europe to improve quality of life and increase the survival rate of cancer patients.  Ranny has been receiving mistletoe injections three times a week  since March  when she was diagnosed. Mistletoe therapy is a viable non-FDA approved treatment option that is not covered by insurance.Ranny has been able to receive these injections even though her physican  Dr. Stacy Mulkey  is based in Colorado. However  after completing her current chemo treatments  Ranny and her doctors  both here in North Carolina and in Colorado  have decided it would be in her best interests to go to Colorado to Namaste Health Center  which is known for its innovative oncology treatment strategies  for more intensive treatments.   http://www.namastehealthcenter.com/#namaste During her three week visit at Namaste  Ranny will meet with different practitioners  including Dr. Mulkey  her integrative oncologist  on a daily basis.  She will be spending approximately six hours a day at the clinic.  She will receive daily Mistletoe infusions and high dose Vitamin C infusions  as warranted. All will be custom made to fit her terrain and diagnosis.  Additionally  she will receive hydrotherapy  ozone  orthobiomomy treatments  acupuncture  and she will meet with a nutritionist.  A three week visit to the Namaste Clinic is approximately $17 000 for the treatments involved  as well as food  lodging and travel.  None of this is covered by health insurance  and yet  it holds much promise for her health. We cannot let the fact that our health insurance system is ineffective factor into this important health decision for Ranny's family. It's hard for us  at times  to know what we can do and how we can help Ranny and her family. This gofundme gives us a way to help the Mast family and support Ranny  while she gets the treatment she needs without worry of further financial hardship for her family. Ranny continues to research and hold out hope for something  anything  that will work to stabilize this disease.

While going through the testing required for his cancer treatments  doctors discovered a genetic defect in his heart that greatly decreases its functioning. Now that Mike is physically healed from his cancer  it is time that he gets his heart fixed so that he is able to completely appreciate his remission. As of right now  Mike's heart condition is taking a great toll on his body  and he is unable to work full-time. Also  in order to be cleared for open heart surgery  he also needs $5 000 in periodontal work that is not covered by the family's health insurance. He is still behind on financial commitments from when he was going through chemo therapy  and the recovery time for his upcoming surgery is at least 3 months. Without some assistance  Mike and his daughter Megan will not be able to afford their bills and expenses. Mike does not qualify for unemployment  and Megan is only able to work part-time as she is in her first year of grad school at Augsburg. They do not take asking for your help lightly  and are very grateful for anything their friends  family  and strangers are willing to give. Megan and her dad are two of the greatest people I know  and they deserve to be able to heal without financial stress. Please give what you can to support these wonderful people. Even if you are unable to help financially  please share this page so that someone else can."

He will also have to undergo radiation treatment  5 days a week for 3 weeks. The hope is that they can shrink the tumor enough so they can eventually surgically remove the cancerous portion of the liver.It will be a long hard road for Ralph. Because of his diagnosis  Ralph has had to shut down his small business.  Thank God  he had health insurance through Michelle’s (Shelly’s) work.  If this diagnosis had come 6 months ago  it would have been a different story.  However  since Michelle has only been working at her current job for six months  she has not gotten to the point where she earns leave… if she doesn’t work  she doesn’t get paid. With Ralph’s current treatment plan and the hospital being 3 hours away from home  there will be many missed days of work.Despite having health insurance  Ralph and Shelly will be faced with staggering medical bills because insurance only covers 80% of the bill.  We do not know how much this will cost in the long term but one website states that liver cancer treatment can cost $50 000-$100 000 (Liver Cancer Treatment Costs ).  Paying for 20% of that is mind boggling.  They will also have to pay for a place to stay during the 3 weeks of radiation treatment.  Even if they are approved to stay at the patient and family  reduced-cost housing at Johns Hopkins  that is $64/night or almost $1000 which does not include food and other expenses while away from home... And more missed days of work with no income.I would love to help Ralph and Shelly so that  WHEN Ralph is cured of this horrible disease  they will not have to worry about how they will pay off their medical bills. I want them to have the happy life they deserve.  Any help you can give is appreciated.  The chemoembolization treatments start Apr 2nd so we need to jump on this now. Any donation  large or small  is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your continued love and prayers."

He searched for communities with hurricane and flood damage.  He set up his grill  started cooking and served hotdogs/hamburgers free to all.  He also fed power crews working long hours to restore power.  Josh put his strong desire to help into action and was able to bless many people.   As they approach an extremely difficult time in their lives I (Aunt Sandra) would like to ask on their behalf for a financial blessing. Josh fortunately has health insurance thru work to cover most medical cost.  However  their income has dropped dramatically due to Amanda's inability to keep up with her daily routine due to doctors visits  treatments  and lack of physical strength.  Josh has missed and will be missing numerous days of work to support his wife when necessary.  Family members are supporting with child care and many other ways.   The goal is to help them get thru one year of bills and expenses(mortgage  car payments  utilities  insurance  and other monthly bills)so the burden of money is not on their minds.  Their finances are already quickly depleting with almost 12 months of medical issues still ahead.  Any donations will be a tremendous blessing to this young family and unbelievably appreciated.   Our prayers will constantly be with Amanda and Josh and anyone who feels a desire to help them.      Thank you so much for taking the time to read!!!!!!!!   Aunt Sandra"
