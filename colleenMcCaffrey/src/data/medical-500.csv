He was diagnosed on February 8th 2019 with a  very aggressive malignant spinal cord tumor - grade IV Diffuse Midline Glioma. This form of cancer is extremely fast growing  is very rare and is inoperable. We are exploring all options including clinical trials. Since entering the hospital in February Ravi has not be able to work and provide for his family.Those who know Ravi would vouch for him being the most loyal of friends  a caring hard working family man. Ravi’s 7 year old son suffers from a severe case of  AUTISM. Ravi is also blessed with a 9 month old baby girl. His wife is home-maker. He needs the support  prayers  and funds to help him and his family through these rough days ahead. We are requesting funds as soon as possible to help with all aspects of his treatment and to help support his two young children and wife. Since his diagnosis he’s had an emergency surgical biopsy that has left him completely bedridden. He is currently undergoing aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore  MD. This sudden diagnosis has been devastating to Ravi and all of our family. Ravi needs round the clock supervision and expensive therapy sessions. Any small donation would go long way to save him and help his family.  Please keep us all in your prayers.Thanks Praveen Varaganti (brother of Ravi Varaganti)"

The first 2 years is the important period to intervene. In order to have the opportunity to help our children  we need to raise $2 million by May 2019. There are two therapies that will give them a chance to live: NeuroMovement therapy in their daily lives and Gene Replacement Therapy to potentially cure the disease. Both are very costly. We need your help to raise the funds to save our twin babies and other families in crisis. -- We have partnered with Chabad of Contra Costa County in order to make your donations tax deductible. / לידיעת ציבור התורמים החשבון צדקה שאנחנו משתמשים  בו הוא של חבד -ללא חשבון זה היה לוקח לנו לפחות 6 חודשים לפתוח חשבון צדקה לכן הקבלות הם על שמםץ --*תרגום לעברית למטה.*Субтитры на иврите ниже.*Traducido al español abajo.Our JourneyA few months ago in May my husband and I were so excited to welcome our twins - Yael and Yoel - into the world. You could not find two people more enthusiastic about becoming parents. I have a background in early childhood education and was so looking forward to raising my own children with the knowledge I had gained. My husband Zohar was also thrilled to have a chance to share his wealth of knowledge and skills with our first children. But things did not quite pan out as expected...      It all started when the twins were about 2.5 months old  when I noticed that Yoel wasn’t tracking objects and appeared to be looking through you  not at you. Their pediatrician dismissed it as “normal” and said that they don’t begin assessing delays until 6 months of age. The mother’s instinct in me was not satisfied; I went to several other specialists until we saw a neurologist who ordered an MRI. Watching my little baby endure a half-hour MRI scan was terrifying. I had to numb my emotions and go through every appointment  every stage of uncertainty  telling myself that everything will be okay yet second-guessing every doctor’s vague assessment.         A few days later the neurologist called and explained that Yoel’s MRI returned abnormal  that he has a metabolic disorder of some kind. To get a proper diagnosis we needed to proceed with genetic testing for both of us parents and Yoel. That evening Yoel experienced his first seizure. It was becoming more apparent that there was something serious happening with him. Meanwhile  the three-week waiting period for the results was mind-numbing with uncertainty and fear. We feigned joy and positivity  holding onto the hope that the prognosis will be a simple diet change  because  how can anything bad happen to our child?     On October 5 the four of us met with the neurologist and geneticist to hear the results. The look on their faces was enough to understand that we were not going to hear the news we were hoping for… “Canavan Disease ” “life-shortening ” “brain degeneration” – the words sent a wave of chills over my body and pierced my heart with disbelief. How can this be happening?! Why should our poor son suffer  what did he do to deserve this awful disease. Meanwhile  we learned that Zohar and I are both carriers of Canavan's and thus every child has a 25% chance of getting the disease. We had to get Yael tested too.       Several days later I got a call from the neurologist. When I thought things couldn’t get any worse  I heard the second devastating news: “Yael’s MRI results are the same as Yoel’s.” I was in utter disbelief. I didn’t want to accept it. Just as we were coming to terms with the horror of having one child with such an awful disease  we learn that our second twin has it too. How can this be happening?! I was so thrilled to be having twins  I never considered it a burden  but rather double the joy. I felt so blessed to have two beautiful babies. Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine a 180-degree flip of this blessing – double the burden  double the grief  double the pain. My life was over  I thought. Meanwhile  I felt guilt-ridden for thinking of my feelings. I need to focus on my children and be strong for them and our family. Nothing else matters.About the Disease    Canavan Disease is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of white matter in the brain. It is caused by a genetic mutation in the ASPA gene. Canavan disease occurs most frequently in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. This disease is inherited when both parents carry the defective gene  and each conceived child has a 25% chance of having this disease.     “There is no cure  there is no treatment…They will never walk or talk ” the doctors grimly stated. For most afflicted with Canavan’s  development plateaus by the age of two. Children with Canavan’s have poor head control  an abnormally large head (macrocephaly)  reduced responsiveness  and an abnormal muscle tone causing stiffness or floppiness. They experience developmental delays  feeding difficulties  seizures  and will eventually become paralyzed and blind. The doctors said that nothing could be done to help them other than manage seizures and try to keep them comfortable. Most affected children are not expected to live past childhood.        What are we supposed to do? How are we supposed to parent children who are degenerating instead of growing and developing every day? Realm of PossibilityScience is the floor; the ceiling is boundless.      We were not about to settle for our twins’ grim future and watch our most precious loves be taken away. We plunged into researching and reaching out to experts on Canavan’s and other families throughout the country and around the world. We learned that there are reasons to hope and steps to be taken toward progress.                  * Experimental treatments in off-label uses for drugs can slow down the degeneration.                  *NeuroMovement therapy that enhances brain plasticity can help them learn new and preserve existing skills.                   *Therapeutic equipment can enhance day-to-day living.                   *Major breakthroughs in gene therapy may lead to a cure for Canavan’s someday soon.     As with any progressive disease  early intervention is critical. We found an amazing learning-based NeuroMovement therapy focused on enhancing brain plasticity  called the Anat Baniel Method. We started three weeks ago and are already seeing improvements in both Yoel and Yael (see Facebook page for updates on their milestones)! Time is brain; the more therapy Yoel and Yael can receive  the more of their brains (and skills) we can save. Unfortunately  our medical insurance is not covering this costly therapy  which amounts to $2 000 per week for two children. Yoel and Yael will also need daily therapies that include physical  occupational  feeding  and developmental therapies.     In addition  we connected with well-respected researchers who have developed a gene replacement therapy customized to treat Canavan Disease. Gene therapy is a groundbreaking medical development which aims to replace the missing gene  and offers a potential cure for Yoel and Yael. They have only one chance to receive this therapy  and the soonest one is projected to be ready for a human clinical trial in Summer 2019  but requires approximately $2 million more to reach Canavan patients. We are desperate to expedite funding to bring this gene therapy out of the lab and into the brains of patients like our twins and the handful of other beautiful children awaiting this treatment. We need your help to raise the funds to give Yael and Yoel a chance to be cured from this heartbreaking disease. *The money raised will go toward a fund helping families in crisis  along with helping cover our twins' NeuroMovement therapy and gene therapy research  which is just steps away from clinical trial. ___________________________________________________________________________Frequently Asked Questions1) Does gene therapy for Canavan Disease help other  more common diseases?Your support for gene therapy for Canavan Disease also contributes to the science and development of gene therapies for other diseases of the brain  such as Multiple Sclerosis  Alzheimer’s Disease  Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.2) Does gene therapy actually work?If you think gene therapy is a far-out concept  you are wrong.

Первые 2 года - важный период для вмешательства. Есть две терапии  которые могут дать им шанс на жизнь: нейро-двигательная терапия в их повседневной жизни и генная заместительная терапия  чтобы потенциально вылечить болезнь. Оба очень дорогие. Нам нужна ваша помощь  чтобы собрать средства  чтобы спасти наших детей-близнецов и другие семьи.                                                                     Наше путешествиеНесколько месяцев назад  в мае  мы с мужем были так рады появлению на свет наших близнецов - Яэль и Ёэль. Вы не могли бы найти в мире двух людей с большим энтузиазмом чем мы стать родителями. У меня есть опыт в дошкольном образовании  и я с нетерпением ждала возможности воспитать своих детей на основе полученных знаний. Мой муж Зохар также был рад возможности поделиться своими знаниями и навыками с нашими первыми детьми. Но все оказалось не так  как ожидалось ... Все началось  когда близнецам было около 2 5 месяцев  когда я заметила  что Ёэль не отслеживает объекты и  похоже  смотрит сквозь вас  а не на вас. Их педиатр отклонил это как «нормальное» и сказал  что они не начинают оценивать задержки до 6-месячного возраста. Материнский инстинкт во мне не был удовлетворен; Я пошла к нескольким другим специалистам  пока мы не увидели невролога  который заказал МРТ. Наблюдение за тем  как мой маленький ребенок терпит  получасовое МРТ было ужасным. Я должна была побороть свои эмоции и пройти каждый прием  каждую стадию неуверенности  говоря себе  что все будет хорошо  и все же сомневаться в неопределенности оценки каждого врача.          Несколько дней спустя позвонил невролог и объяснил  что МРТ Ёэля вернулась и что у него есть какое-то нарушение обмена веществ. Чтобы поставить правильный диагноз  нам нужно было пройти генетическое тестирование нас - обоих родителей и Ёэля. В тот вечер Ёэль пережил свой первый приступ. Становилось все более очевидным  что с ним происходит что-то серьезное. Между тем  трехнедельный период ожидания результатов был ошеломляющим от неуверенности и страха. Мы симулировали радость и позитив  надеясь  что прогноз будет простым изменением диеты  потому что  как может случиться что-то плохое с нашим ребенком?     5 октября мы  встретились с неврологом и генетиком  чтобы услышать результаты. По выражению их лиц было достаточно  чтобы понять  что мы не услышим новостей  на которые надеялись… «Болезнь Канавана»  «Укорочение жизни»  «Дегенерация мозга» - эти слова вызвали волну озноба на моем теле и пронзили мое сердце неверием. Как это может происходить ?! Зачем страдать нашему бедному сыну  что он сделал  чтобы заслужить эту ужасную болезнь. Тем временем мы узнали  что мы с Зоаром являемся носителями Канавана  и  таким образом  у каждого ребенка есть 25% шанс заболеть. Мы также должны были проверить Яэль.     Через несколько дней мне позвонил невролог. Когда я думала  что все не может стать хуже  я услышала вторую разрушительную новость: «Результаты МРТ Яэль такие же  как у Ёэля». Я была в полном недоумении. Я не хотела принимать это. Подобно тому  как мы смирились с ужасом рождения одного ребенка с таким ужасным заболеванием  мы узнаем  что у нашего второго близнеца тоже есть. Как это может происходить ?! Я была так взволнована  что у меня близнецы  я никогда не считала это бременем  а скорее удваивала радость. Я была очень счастлива иметь двух прекрасных детей. Никогда в моих самых страшных снах я не могла представить себе поворот этого благословения на 180 градусов - удвоить бремя  удвоить горе  удвоить боль. Моя жизнь закончилась  подумала я. Тем временем я чувствовала вину за то  что думала о своих чувствах. Я должна сосредоточиться на своих детях и быть сильной для них и нашей семьи. Остальное не важно.О болезни    Болезнь Канавана - это редкое неврологическое заболевание  характеризующееся дегенерацией белого вещества в мозге. Это вызвано генетической мутацией в гене ASPA. Болезнь Канавана чаще всего встречается у ашкеназского еврейского населения. Эта болезнь передается по наследству  когда оба родителя несут дефектный ген  и у каждого зачатого ребенка вероятность этого заболевания составляет 25%.     «Нет лекарства  нет лечения ... Они никогда не будут ходить и разговаривать»  - мрачно заявили врачи. Для большинства страдающих от Болезни Канавана  останaвливается развитие в возрасте до двух лет. У детей страдающих от Болезни Канавана плохой контроль над головой  аномально большая голова (макроцефалия)  сниженная чувствительность и ненормальный мышечный тонус  вызывающий скованность или гибкость. Они испытывают задержки развития  трудности с кормлением  судороги и в конечном итоге станут парализованными и слепыми. Врачи сказали  что ничего нельзя сделать  чтобы помочь им  кроме как управлять припадками и стараться  чтобы они чувствовали себя комфортно. Ожидается  что большинство пострадавших детей умрут в раннем детстве.Что мы должны делать? Как мы должны родить детей  которые вырождаются  а не растут и развиваются каждый день?                       Царство ВозможностейНаука - это пол; небеса безграничны.      Мы не собирались соглашаться на мрачное будущее наших близнецов и смотреть  как будут уходить наши самые драгоценные люди. Мы погрузились в исследование и установление контактов с экспертами по Болезни Канавана и другим семьям по всей стране и по всему миру. Мы узнали  что есть основания для надежды и шаги  которые необходимо предпринять для прогресса.                  * Экспериментальное лечение может замедлить дегенерацию.                  * NeuroMovement терапия  которая повышает пластичность мозга  может помочь им освоить новые и сохранить существующие навыки.                  * Терапевтическое оборудование может улучшить повседневную жизнь.                  * Крупные прорывы в генной терапии могут привести к излечению Болезни Канавана в ближайшее время.     Как и при любом прогрессирующем заболевании  раннее вмешательство имеет решающее значение. Мы обнаружили удивительную  основанную на обучении терапию NeuroMovement  направленную на повышение пластичности мозга  которая называется метод Anat Baniel. Мы начали три недели назад и уже наблюдаем улучшения как у Ёэля  так и у Яэль (см. Страницу Facebook для получения обновленной информации об их этапах)! Время - это мозг; чем больше терапии смогут получить Ёэль и Яэль  тем больше их умственных способностей (и навыков) мы сможем сохранить. К сожалению  наша медицинская страховка не покрывает эту дорогостоящую терапию  которая составляет 2000 долларов в неделю на двоих детей. Ёэль и Яэль также будут нуждаться в ежедневной терапии  которая включает в себя физическую  профессиональную  кормовую и развивающую терапию.     Кроме того  мы связались с уважаемыми исследователями  которые разработали генно-заместительную терапию  адаптированную для лечения болезни Канавана. Генная терапия - это революционное медицинское развитие  которое направлено на замену недостающего гена и предлагает потенциальное лекарство для Ёэля и Яэль. У них есть только один шанс получить эту терапию  и  по прогнозам  самый скорый из них будет готов к клиническим испытаниям на людях летом 2019 года  но потребует еще около 2 миллионов долларов для охвата пациентов Канавана. Мы отчаянно пытаемся ускорить финансирование  чтобы вывести эту генную терапию из лаборатории в мозг пациентов  таких как наши близнецы и горстка других прекрасных детей  ожидающих этого лечения. Нам нужна ваша помощь  чтобы собрать средства  чтобы дать Ёэлю и Яэль шанс излечиться от этой душераздирающей болезни.Царство Возможностей* Собранные деньги пойдут в фонд помощи семьям  находящимся в кризисной ситуации  а также на покрытие расходов на исследования в области нейроподвижности и генной терапии наших близнецов  которые находятся всего в нескольких шагах от клинических испытаний.______________________________________________________________________Часто задаваемые вопросы1) Помогает ли генная терапия при болезни Канавана другим  более распространенным заболеваниям?Ваша поддержка генной терапии при болезни Канавана также способствует научным исследованиям и разработке генной терапии для других заболеваний головного мозга  таких как рассеянный склероз  болезнь Альцгеймера  болезнь Паркинсона и амиотрофический боковой склероз.2) Действительно ли генная терапия работает?Если вы думаете  что генная терапия является далеко идущей концепцией  вы ошибаетесь.

Los primeros 2 años es el período más importante para intervenir. Para tener la oportunidad de ayudar a nuestros hijos  necesitamos recaudar $2 millones de dólares para mayo de 2019. Hay dos terapias que les darán la oportunidad de vivir: \"NeuroMovement Therapy\" para sus vidas diarias y \"Gene Replacement Therapy\" para curar la enfermedad. Ambas son muy costosas. Necesitamos su ayuda y así salvar a nuestros bebés y otras familias en crisis. - Nos hemos asociado con Chabad de Contra Costa County para que sus donaciones sean deducibles de impuestos.Nuestro trayectoHace unos meses  en mayo  mi esposo y yo estábamos muy emocionados de darle bienvenida a nuestros mellizos  Yoel y Yael al mundo. No se podía encontrar a dos personas más emocionadas acerca de ser padres. Tengo experiencia en educación infantil y tenía muchas ganas de criar a mis propios hijos con el conocimiento que había adquirido. Mi esposo Zohar también estaba encantado de tener la oportunidad de compartir su riqueza de conocimientos y habilidades con ellos. Pero las cosas no salieron como se esperaba...Todo comenzó cuando los mellizos tenían aproximadamente 2.5 meses de edad  noté que Yoel no estaba rastreando objetos y parecía estar mirando a través de ti  no a ti. Su pediatra lo descartó como \"normal\" y dijo que no se comienzan a evaluar los retrasos hasta los 6 meses de edad. El instinto de madre en mí no estaba satisfecho. Fui a varios otros especialistas hasta que vimos a un neurólogo que ordenó una resonancia magnética. Ver a mi pequeño bebé soportar una resonancia magnética de media hora fue aterrador. Tuve que adormecer mis emociones e ir a través de cada cita  cada etapa  diciéndome a mí misma que todo estará bien a la vez con la intertidumbre de las evaluaciones imprecisas de los doctores.Unos días después  el neurólogo llamó y explicó que la resonancia magnética de Yoel salió como anormal  que tenía algún tipo de trastorno metabólico. Para obtener un diagnóstico adecuado  necesitabamos proceder con las pruebas genéticas para ambos padres y Yoel. Esa noche  Yoel experimentó su primer ataque. Se estaba volviendo más evidente que algo grave estaba sucediendo con él. Mientras tanto  el período de espera de tres semanas para los resultados fue confuso con incertidumbre y miedo. Fingimos alegría y positividad  manteniendo la esperanza de que el pronóstico será un cambio de dieta simple  porque  ¿Cómo le puede suceder algo malo a nuestro hijo? El 5 de octubre los cuatro nos reunimos con el neurólogo y genetista para escuchar los resultados. La expresión de los rostros de los doctores fue suficiente para comprender que no íbamos a escuchar las noticias que esperábamos ... \"Enfermedad de Canavan\"  \"Acortamiento de la vida\"  \"Degeneración cerebral\": las palabras provocaron una oleada de escalofríos en mi cuerpo y traspasó mi corazón con incredulidad. ¡¿Cómo puede estar pasando esto?! ¿Por qué debería sufrir nuestro pobre hijo  qué hizo para merecer esta terrible enfermedad? Mientras tanto  aprendimos que Zohar y yo  somos portadores de Canavan  por lo tanto cada niño tiene un 25% de probabilidad de contraer la enfermedad. Tuvimos que poner a Yael a prueba también. Varios días después recibí una llamada del neurólogo. Cuando pensé que las cosas no podían empeorar  escuché la segunda noticia devastadora: \"Los resultados de MRI de Yael son los mismos que los de Yoel\". Estaba en absoluta incredulidad. No quería aceptarlo. Justo cuando estábamos llegando a un acuerdo con el horror de tener un hijo con una enfermedad tan terrible  aprendemos que nuestra otra melliza también lo tiene. ¡¿Cómo puede estar pasando esto?! Estaba tan emocionada de tener mellizos  nunca lo consideré una carga  sino más bien una doble la alegría. Me sentí tan bendecida de tener dos bebés hermosos. Nunca en mis sueños más locos podría haberme imaginado un giro de 180 grados de esta bendición: duplicar la carga  duplicar la pena  duplicar el dolor. Mi vida había terminado  pensé. Mientras tanto  me sentía culpable por pensar solo en mis sentimientos. Necesitaba enfocarme en mis hijos y ser fuerte para ellos y nuestra familia. Nada más importaba.Sobre la enfermedad La enfermedad de Canavan es un raro trastorno neurológico caracterizado por la degeneración de la materia blanca en el cerebro. Es causada por una mutación genética en el gen ASPA. La enfermedad de Canavan ocurre con mayor frecuencia en la población judía ashkenazi. Esta enfermedad se hereda cuando ambos padres portan el gen defectuoso y cada hijo concebido tiene un 25% de probabilidad de padecer esta enfermedad. \"No hay cura  no hay tratamiento...nunca caminarán  ni hablarán\"  afirmaron los médicos con gravedad. Para la mayoría de los afligidos con Canavan  la enfermedad se desarrolla a la edad de dos años. Los niños con Canavan tienen un pobre control de la cabeza  una cabeza anormalmente grande (macrocefalia)  capacidad de respuesta reducida y masa muscular anormal que causa rigidez o flojedad. Experimentan retrasos en el desarrollo  dificultades con la alimentación  convulsiones y eventualmente se paralizarán y se volverán ciegos. Los médicos dijeron que no se podía hacer nada para ayudarlos  aparte de controlar las convulsiones y tratar de mantenerlos cómodos. No se espera que la mayoría de los niños afectados vivan más allá de la infancia. ¿Qué se supone que hagamos? ¿Cómo se supone que debemos criar hijos que degeneran en lugar de crecer y desarrollarse cada día?El reino de la posibilidadLa ciencia es el piso; el techo es ilimitado. No estábamos dispuestos a conformarnos con el sombrío futuro de nuestros mellizos y ver cómo desaparecen nuestros más preciados amores. Nos pusimos a investigar y contactar a expertos en Canavan y otras familias en todo el país y en todo el mundo. Aprendimos que hay razones para tener esperanza y pasos a seguir para avanzar. * Los tratamientos experimentales en usos no oficiales de medicamentos pueden retardar la degeneración. * La terapia de movimiento neurológico que mejora la plasticidad del cerebro  puede ayudarles a aprender nuevas y preservar las habilidades existentes. * El equipo que se usa en las terapias puede mejorar la vida cotidiana. * Los grandes avances en la terapia genética pueden llegar a una cura para Canavan  pronto. Como con cualquier enfermedad progresiva  la intervención temprana es crítica. Encontramos una increíble terapia de \"NeuroMovement\" basada en el aprendizaje centrada en mejorar la plasticidad del cerebro  llamada Método Anat Baniel. ¡Comenzamos hace tres semanas y ya estamos viendo mejoras en Yoel y Yael (vea la página de Facebook para ver las actualizaciones de su progreso)! El tiempo es cerebro ; Cuanta más terapia puedan recibir Yoel y Yael  más de sus cerebros (y habilidades) podremos salvar. Desafortunadamente  nuestro seguro médico no cubre esta costosa terapia  que equivale a $2 000 por semana para dos niños. Yoel y Yael también necesitarán terapias diarias que incluyan terapias físicas  ocupacionales  de alimentación y de desarrollo. Además  nos conectamos con investigadores muy respetados que han desarrollado una terapia de reemplazo de genes personalizada para tratar la enfermedad de Canavan. La terapia genética es un desarrollo médico innovador que apunta a reemplazar el gen faltante y ofrece una cura potencial para Yoel y Yael . Solo tienen una oportunidad de recibir esta terapia   y se proyecta que la más rápida estará lista para un ensayo clínico en humanos en el verano de 2019  pero requiere aproximadamente $2 millones de dólares más para llegar a los pacientes de Canavan. Estamos desesperados por acelerar el financiamiento para llevar esta terapia genética fuera del laboratorio y al cerebro de pacientes como nuestros mellizos y un montón de otros niños hermosos que esperan este tratamiento. Necesitamos su ayuda para recaudar fondos para dar a Yoel y Yael la oportunidad de curarse de esta enfermedad desgarradora.* El dinero recaudado se destinará a un fondo para ayudar a las familias en crisis  además de ayudar a cubrir la terapia de \"NeuroMovement\" y la investigación en terapia genética de nuestros mellizos  que se encuentra a solo unos pasos del ensayo clínico. Preguntas frecuentes 1) ¿La terapia genética para la enfermedad de Canavan ayuda a otras enfermedades más comunes? Su apoyo a la terapia genética para la enfermedad de Canavan también contribuye a la ciencia y al desarrollo de terapias genéticas para otras enfermedades del cerebro  como la esclerosis múltiple  la enfermedad de Alzheimer  la enfermedad de Parkinson y la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica. 2) ¿Funciona realmente la terapia genética? Si crees que la terapia genética es un concepto lejano  estás equivocado. LA TERAPIA DE GENES ESTÁ PASANDO AHORA. El 31 de agosto de 2017  la FDA anunció su aprobación de una terapia genética para la leucemia linfoblástica aguda (ALL)  la primera terapia genética aprobada en los EE. UU. ¡El progreso está sucediendo ahora! Al apoyar nuestros esfuerzos de recaudación de fondos  puede ayudar a salvar la vida de nuestros mellizos y ser parte del avance de este campo de la medicina. 3) ¿Es mi donación deducible de impuestos? ¡Sí!

They need our help! Cody has a Tumor on his brain stem that is growing. The plan is to have it removed February 13th.  #loveyoucodymanGod started our friendship in 9th grade. He has been my Best Man from day one  proving it by being the Best Man for each others wedding days.  A lot happens between 9th grade and 31 years old. Cody was one of my first brothers in Christ. He has been and is still the example I strive to be like. Not only do I look up to him as a brother in Christ but as a brother in the Fire Service. With growing up together we both took the path to becoming firefighters. Although we are in different states now  we are still brothers in both respects. This man is who you dream of having as a friend  husband  father  son and brother. I wouldn't want anyone less coming to my rescue. Please join me in helping relieve some of the financial stress that comes with this trial. Your contributions will be used to cover the $7000 deductible for Cody's surgery and related appointments and for hospital costs with the birth of their newest addition in March. Donations will also be used for their youngest  Georgia's   up coming surgery. The kids are on a separate insurance and have a deductible of their own. These alone will cost a minimum of $10 000 out of pocket  just this year  for the Mooney family. The goal is set at $15 000 as of now and that \"extra\" $5000 is for fuel cost (45 min drive minimum to Dr.'s)  flights  food  hotels for them and for family to help with the kids  and moving costs in the spring as they will be having to move out of their current home. This is just for the basics! Let's at least take care of that for them. Any and all donations are very appreciated  Let's make a difference for the Mooneys! Thank you in advance. Below is a letter written by Emily to all of you. It has more detail of their circumstances and will give you a clear picture of what they are facing. Again thank you!LETTER FROM EMILYIn June of 2017 we experienced God working in crazy ways that lead us to the finding and diagnosis of a tumor growing in Cody’s brain stem. Due to the location  the risk of surgery and over a 60% chance ofpost-op deficit  we chose together as a family to wait and monitor things  as it was not affecting his quality of life or ability to work at the time. Living with the reality of a tumor growing in your brain is a weird thing to balance emotionally. But we feel extremely grateful for this time together as a family  living and enjoying life so intentionally for any amount of time that God would give us. It has helped us to accept andprepare as much as possible for the season we currently find ourselves in. Since Christmas Cody has noticed/developed new symptoms  and tests have now confirmed a 50% growth with an immediate need to proceed with surgery  both due to his symptoms and the risk ofhemorrhage due to the tumor becoming more unstable the larger it gets. Cody will be undergoing surgery on February 13th. The length of surgery will depend greatly on what they find once they get inside. But it could take most of the day as they will be removing part of his skull  part of C1 and C2  and then attempt to remove all of the tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue and nerves. Apparently all kinds ofvery important things pass through your brain stem so you can’t get too carried away while your cutting ;-) We of course were hoping for more time before this surgery became necessary  but are so thankful forthe ability to trust in God’s perfect timing for Cody  and for our family. He has given us peace  direction  and brought the right people  doctors  and surgeons to us during all of this. We are moving forwardconfident that this is all in His perfect time and plan. Cody’s recovery will require him to take a minimum of 12 weeks off from work since his responsibilities as a firefighter require such potential for physical exertion. His recovery requires time for his brain to heal and post-op swelling to go away  as well as the many neck muscles and nerves that will be affected due to the large size of the incision that is needed to get clear access to the tumor. There will be countless appointments  which requires a lot of extra driving since we live up in the beautiful mountains and not just down the street from our neurosurgeon. We will have family coming to stay with us and help with the kids so Emma can focus on helping Cody recover quickly and fully. Additionally  our family is anxiously anticipating the arrival of our fifth baby in March! We are praying she is strong and healthy and that momand baby all bounce right back into “normal” life around here. But there is a chance that she  like two of her siblings  will be born with a genetic disorder requiring surgeries and other medical procedures notlong after birth. We also know that our youngest daughter will be going in for her next surgery this spring!We know that no matter the details  the outcomes  and the timing of all of these things  we will have whatwe need to walk the days  weeks and months to come. It won’t always be easy  but God is always faithful. We so appreciate your prayers of safety  healing and comfort over Cody and our family during this timealong with all your support. We feel so loved and blessed already by the amazing family and friends we have surrounding us!Love The Mooney FamilyCody  Emma  Willow  Barrett  Weston  Georgia & Baby Girl Due in March"

He was born to Tzvika and Janice Lazar on November 19  1987. Yotam grew up in Northern Israel on beautiful Kibbutz Gadot with a brother and two sisters. In all honesty  Yotam would probably like me to share with you that he is a force of nature - independent  fearless and strong.  A power to be reckoned with since birth.I would  however  be utterly remiss not to share with you who he really is:Yotam’s persona to the world is certainly a fearless force of nature not to be reckoned with  but the kibbutz rumors have it that he was the little jokester of his kibbutz posse. He has never backed down from standing up for those around him  and certainly never allows anyone to be without a smile. Yotam radiates positivity and lives not for the unknown future ahead of him  but for the gift of the present. As Yotam grew older  not a whole lot changed except for the size of his heart as he dedicated his life to serving others. If you are ever lucky enough to meet him  you’ll quickly learn he is a hero  but he will never admit to it nor ever accept others seeing him as one.  Yotam’s dream led him to the United States. During his years in New York City  he met the love of his life  Jennifer Gutman. I once questioned if love at first sight truly existed  but Yotam has confirmed that for all of us. Yotam and Jen were quick to fall in love. They moved back to Israel and settled in Tel Aviv together with their beloved dog  Eden. They have been married now coming up on 2 incredible years full of endless laughter  love and happy memories. Yotam and Jen are pregnant  due with their first child in May 2019  and they couldn’t be more thrilled and excited to become parents. It all sounds too perfect to be true  right?                                                What's Happening NowA few weeks ago  on Yotam’s 31st birthday  he found out he was going to be a father to a baby boy. This was the greatest birthday gift he could imagine. But fate would have it that same day  Yotam was diagnosed with a rare and highly aggressive brain cancer  Glioblastoma (GBM). I regret to inform you that it is stage 4. Yotam has already fought through 2 brain surgeries to remove as much of the tumor as possible  both of which were a success. He will be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation shortly; however  doctors have informed Yotam and Jen that this will only buy him more time  and not the kind of time he deserves. They have been looking into any and all treatments that instead of more time  may promise Yotam his life back. While undergoing treatment  Yotam and Jen will not be able to work  so they are in need of financial support. They will have some medical expenses that will not be fully covered by insurance. They are in the process of moving to a new apartment that can accommodate Yotam’s life changing needs  which come with additional expenses. Once the baby comes  they will need to hire a nanny to assist Jen. There will likely be more unforeseen expenses  and they need all the support they can get. A few months ago  Yotam said to me: “Life is too easy  don’t take it too seriously  you must go and enjoy the day to day.” Now more than ever  our hero needs a hero. Yotam is going to war to fight for his life  let's fight with him.Please help us ensure that Yotam lives an easier life  not taken seriously nor lived stressfully by way of financial troubles  but rather enjoying his day to day as he begins the real battle fighting cancer and taking back his life. Thank you for your support.*Every dollar donated to this campaign will go directly towards Yotam’s fight and recovery."

On June  17  2016 I was in an unfortunate accident while wrestling with friend of mine. I damaged the c5 and c6 sections of my spinal cord (lower neck region)  which left me paralyzed from the neck down. Thanks to surgery  physical therapy  occupational therapy  & God  I have regained sensation in most of my body  motor skills from my stomach to my neck  and some voluntary movements in my hands. However I am however still unable to walk  stand  move my legs  battle with muscle spasms  and control bowel and bladder. The inability to do these things has given me a very dependent and unfulfilled life at such a young age. In 2017 a physical therapist at the Shirley Ryan Abilitylab (formerly known as the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago or R.I.C) showed me a video of the work being done at Unique Access Medical in Bangkok  Thailand where they were researching stem cells and the effect on damaged spinal chords. The procedure has given many people back voluntary movement and the abilities to stand walk and control bladder and bowel. After a couple months of research I sent an inquiry into Epidural Stimulation and asked about receiving the treatment. Unfortunately insurance does not cover it and it is not in the United States so I am trying to raise the money for travel and surgery by myself. I’m raising money in hopes that the surgery can get me back on my feet and let me be the independent and happy person I once was.The money donated will be used to help me pay for the epidural stimulation surgery  physical therapy  occupational therapy  medications  travel expenses and anything else insurance may not cover.Thank you to everybody who may donate or share this campaign.

He and his wife  Vanessa  had recently welcomed their first child  a beautiful baby boy named Weston to the world. The musical that Sam had been working on for over a decade had just been accepted into a prestigious theatre accelerator program. There was so much to be grateful for…Midway through January  Sam began to experience headaches and he had lost 10 pounds. He figured the headaches were caused by the lack of sleep that came along with his new role as Daddy  and the weight loss seemed like it could easily be the byproduct of a busy schedule – Sam had spent the better part of 2018 going back and forth to Vermont to care for his ailing mother  Marianna. He helped her make the move to assisted living and he cleaned out the family home of 50+ years – no small task  indeed.On Thursday  January 17th  as his headaches grew stronger  Sam decided to go to the doctor. The doctor thought the pain might be sinus-related so he ordered a CT Scan. The scan revealed a mass on Sam’s brain. Within a day  he was in brain surgery. Unfortunately the tumor was too intertwined so the surgeons couldn’t remove it. By Sunday  Sam and Vanessa were informed that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Further scans showed the cancer was also in his liver  spine  and jaw.In the face of this devastating news  Sam and Vanessa have been incredibly strong and positive. Humor and laughter  which have been a huge part of Sam’s life  will undoubtedly help him with what lies ahead. Just hours after being diagnosed  Sam was cheering on his beloved New England Patriots in his hospital room. When the nurse asked him to “cheer quieter ” Sam politely nodded. When the nurse left the room  Sam turned to Vanessa and his friends and said  “What are they gonna do? Kill me?”Sam is  simply put  a sweet  kind  and generous soul. Through his music and acting  and most of all his friendship  he has blessed all of our lives immeasurably. Throughout his wonderful life  including his more than 30 years in Los Angeles  Sam has perfected the fine art of friendship. So many of those friends have reached out  wanting to know how they can help support him and his family during this difficult time. As Sam and Vanessa face the challenges ahead  they will both have to put working on hold. There will be a range of medical  childcare  and other expenses. We are asking for your help so our dear Sammy can use the time ahead to GET HEALTHY  spend time with his wife  his new son  and his wonderful friends – and to borrow the title of the new song Sam wrote for his show... “Make Music Along The Way.”Every prayer  every positive thought  every dollar  and every gesture of support is greatly appreciated.ANY AMOUNT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  Thank you and please check back here for updates!"

Words like loving  encouraging  fierce  spunky  selfless  warm  gracious  loyal  vibrant   full of life and love... don't even begin to encompass the wonder that she is. Wife to Mario  incredible mother to Eden and Monica  daughter  sister  aunt  niece...and a one of a kind friend to so many. To know Jen is to love her...and love her some more.She has been a cheerleader in so many of our lives...and I would imagine like me  you are probably deeply wishing you could do anything to help in her time of need. Jen is so strong  positive  and independent and she has been pushing through this journey for a long time with an incredible attitude. As many of you know  even in the midst of her own fight with cancer  she started \"Join The Flock against Cancer\"  a charitable endeavor to ensure others battling cancer have the financial support they need to focus on the fight and  ultimately   recovery.  Our girl puts the well being of others in front of her own  but while she is unbelievably strong  she cannot fight this battle alone.  Sometimes the smallest gesture can mean the world and while we can’t deliver a “magic eraser”  maybe we can provide some strength and security when it’s needed most. If you or a loved one have experienced cancer personally   you know the costs are extraordinary - and even more so when self employed. Currently their monthly insurance premiums alone are extremely high and that is before any treatment  procedure  test  nutritional or supplemental support. Not to mention all of this in addition to the regular expenses of a family of four. In addition  unfortunately recent tests have shown the cancer is progressing and as a result  expenses will continue to mount as current treatment options carry price tags between $50 000 and $75 000 + travel and she may have to do it twice. The treatment they are considering is a form of immunotherapy with an award winning cancer researcher that has been getting great results on a treatment not yet approved here in the states. It has to be paid for upfront and everything is out of pocket. I'm hoping that together  we can help lift this financial burden so Jen and Mario can focus on fighting and winning the battle against cancer.  And I pray that through our help  they will feel the immense love of so many surrounding them. Anything you can give would be amazing. Please feel free to privately pass this on to anyone you feel would want to be a part of this fight. Let's cheer on Team Lazo and lift them up with all we have! Love you guys and I know Jen does too.Love Carla  Katie W  Lindsey  Courtney  Katie S"

He was rushed directly into surgery upon being brought to the trauma center of John Muir Hospital in nearby Walnut Creek. Tim had sustained severe head trauma when he fell  and doctors needed to act quickly to reduce the swelling and bleeding in his brain  removing a piece of his skull in the process. He spent the next 3 weeks in the ICU on life support  with a breathing machine  constant IV fluids  and intubated feeding while his doctors worked to keep him alive and bring him back to consciousness. Mom (Debbie) and Dad (Frank) flew out to be with him immediately  who were quickly followed by brothers Andy  Jeff  and Jonathan  and girlfriend Natalie. Tim has been moved several times since to Kentfield Hospital for rehabilitative care and treatment  and back to John Muir  where surgeons have replaced the piece of his skull that was removed.  He is now in Acute Rehab at John Muir.It has been a difficult road for Tim. With the damage he received to his brain in the fall  he awoke with only limited control of the muscles in his left side  and no ability to move his right side at all. Communication is a significant challenge as his speech center in the temporal lobe was damaged  but doctors believe that he can regain some of this in time  with daily therapy to redevelop and train the neural pathways from his brain to the rest of his body.He has seen great progress and wonderful care under the watchful eye of his doctors and therapists  and has even begun to regain his comprehension and the use of his right arm and leg! Mom and Dad have never left his side during this time  taking time away from home and work to protect one of the most valuable things in their lives; Dad even having to resign from his job to be there for Tim. While his doctors and family work to provide the very best care for Tim  the road ahead will be very long  and very difficult...To date  the costs for John Muir are an upwards of $2 162 000  not including the $35 000 bill from Kentfield - much of this will be covered by insurance  but not all  and Mom and Dad's temporary relocation/living expenses in California for the last few months have been a factor. We do not have an estimate for the anticipated expenses of Tim's ongoing care but his co-pays and deductibles will exceed $10 000   and he is in need of handicap accessible items (ie. wheelchair)  adaptive equipment  and home modifications that are not covered by insurance.Tim will be leaving CA (sometime in December) to continue therapy in Boston  which will continue for months. With no ability to work  he will have no income  depending on support from family for ongoing expenses  including increased health insurance costs and everyday living expenses  as he continues on his long road to recovery.We now need your help to get through this difficult time. His progress is encouraging  but he will have a great deal of work to do before he can get back to the Tim Butterworth that everyone knows and loves. Still a talented musician and performer  we know that he will still be able to bring people smiles  but he will need your help to get there. Please help us to help Tim bring music to the world again!"

Sometimes  people use it in ways that don’t really apply. Mark Livingston and his family – wife Kirstyn and wonderful children Maya  age 11  and Owen  9 – are in the midst of circumstances this cliché applies to  and that no amount of planning can prevent or manage.  And they need our help.As many of you know  Mark and Kirstyn already have been managing several life-changing events.In November 2017 Mark had to undergo unexpected open-heart surgery. And  even though he was insured  the insurance did not cover the life-saving expenses they incurred  and it definitely didn’t cover the income the family lost while Mark was unable to work during his recovery.This followed just two months after the devastating hurricanes Irma and Maria left their home uninhabitable.  They have been living in a 5th-wheel travel trailer on their property for over a year as their home is still undergoing repairs.  As with so many families  the insurance they carried did not protect (and could not possibly have protected) the family from all of the financial impact they suffered  especially when followed by Mark’s medical emergency.  Their financial safety net was decimated.  Mark and Kirstyn persevered with the spirit and humor and resilience we all cherish so much.  Even when they learned that Mark had to undergo another open heart surgery to re-repair his mitral valve. And on Valentine’s Day  it seemed that his surgery was a complete success … until he did not wake from the anesthesia.A CT scan revealed that Mark had suffered a stroke during surgery.Mark has been in ICU in Dallas since then.  Tests have revealed that the stroke caused significant harm.  Because he’s been mostly out of consciousness  the full extent is not yet clear. One thing  however  is very clear: Mark  Kirstyn  and their family are facing a long and uncertain path to a recovery that is not assured.At this point  we know only two things:First  Mark will have to stay under the care of health professionals in Dallas for at least the next several months  and won’t be able to work as a physician in private practice for the foreseeable future.Second  the perfect storm of health-care expenses – plus the cost of rebuilding – amplified by the income they’ve already lost and will continue to lose as Mark is unable to work and Kirstyn travels between home and Dallas  hoping to return to her own practice as a mental health therapist as soon as possible while trying to assure as much normalcy for their children as she can – has wiped out the family’s financial safety net.As their friends and community can attest  Mark and Kirstyn have dedicated their personal and professional lives to helping others.  But they have found themselves now in the position of needing significant help themselves.Your prayers  love  and messages of support have sustained Kirstyn since Mark’s stroke. She could not have managed without them. She is grateful to everyone who has helped in practical ways with meals  care packages  transportation  and other support for Maya  Owen  and Kirstyn’s dad  Dan  as he cares for the children while she remains at the hospital with Mark.Now what Mark  Kirstyn  Maya  and Owen need – and will need for months to come – is financial help.Fear of unexpected health expenses weighs heavily in our consciousness for a good reason: the costs of care  even with insurance  are simply ruinous. Mark and Kirstyn can no longer absorb the expenses they will face as Mark recovers. Their household income has been slashed  and it seems unlikely they will ever recover it completely. And no one knows what additional unexpected expenses their family will confront as Mark heals.  Mark and Kirstyn have helped countless individuals live healthier and more fulfilling lives.Now it’s time for all of us  as individuals  to help Mark  Kirstyn  Maya  and Owen.Any amount helps  and everyone who cares for this wonderful family is grateful for whatever you can contribute."

When Brad's first brain tumor was found six months ago  he immediately had brain surgery (he went on to have 4 surgeries over the following two months).  Needless to say  he was unable to effectively work  though he continued to try - even using his laptop right from his hospital bed hours after surgery.  Every penny they managed to save in the business  went to supporting Brad's living expenses over the next 6 months while he was unable to work.  At the time of his passing  Amy is left with no business and no additional funds to draw from.  (Amy has found part-time employment with another local IT company  and this company has been graciously supporting many of Brad's previous clients.)Julia's heartbreaking diagnosis couldn't have come at a worse time  financially.  The doctors said Amy and her husband Reed will likely be spending the majority of their time in the hospital over the next year  dealing with the actual treatment and then all of the medical emergencies that realistically come out of having no immune system.  After six months of intense chemo  they're looking at possible radiation  although doctors want to avoid radiation in a child so young  followed by another six months of less-intense chemo.  Both Amy and her husband have employers who are sympathetic to their situation and will hold their positions while they are caring for their daughter. I am creating this campaign to help with all of the expenses that goes along  with caring for a child with cancer  and to make sure that Julia can keep her house so she has a home to go home to.  There will be a long list of medical bills  driving expenses  food  babysitting care for Amy and Reed’s youngest son  Gabriel  the mortgage payments and utilities. Amy and Reed are good  deserving people.  I can't believe they are facing this.  No one should be forced to lose a parent and a child  in the same year  to the same disease. ————————-Ways to help Julia:GIVE whatever you can.

Josh is an amazing dad  an Albany airport firefighter  and all around fun-loving guy. Chelsea is a self-employed \"mom-preneur\" photographer in the Capital District and has shared so many of your happiest life moments behind the lens of her camera. These two are the ones you want on your team. On Monday  February 4th  on their usual date night  Josh mentioned that he thought he'd pulled a muscle in his arm and it was sore. Being a firefighter  this isn't an unlikely occurrence. The next day he woke up with a fever but thought absolutely nothing of it  figured he caught what their two young kids had a few days prior and expected a few days of yuck. Wednesday night (2/6)  over night  the pain from the “pulled muscle” became excruciating and the fever persisted. Chelsea and Josh assumed he must have actually torn a muscle and figured he should go to the ER for some meds to help ease the pain and maybe a sling for his arm. It was such a casual occasion that Chelsea dropped him off at the ER  kissed him and said  text me when you want me to pick you up. Within a couple of hours a doctor was calling her from his phone saying she needed to get back to the hospital ASAP if she wanted to see him before he went in for emergency surgery. Josh did not have a flu  he was SEPTIC. They THOUGHT initially it could have been a small cut near his arm or even just a pimple that grew inwards but TURNS OUT THE INFECTION STARTED WITH STREP  STREP. The infection was so bad all near his arm and chest it took the doctors about two hours to operate on him just to clean out as much of the infection as they could  but by the time they got in there  it had already spread to his heart  lungs  kidney  and liver.Josh is currently fighting for his life AT  St. Peters Hospital! His kidneys are failing and he is on dialysis. He is currently stable  but these are critical hours. All Chelsea can do right now is sit by his bedside  pray  and wait for a miracle. What WE can do is come together to support this family by prayer and action. Being self-employed does not lend well to these situations and Josh is going to have a long road to recovery. Chelsea will need to take time off from her business in order to care for him and maintain stability in the life of their children. We are raising funds to support the family for childcare and medical expenses during this time. It's our turn to be on THEIR team!All donations will be going directly to The Woodward Family & to first responders in need!Anything you can contribute to them is a blessing!Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the continued love and support towards this incredible family.<3___________________________________________________________________________________________________________"

Meanwhile  Eviana  his partner of 4 years  has given all of her time and energy to manage his care full-time  while being responsible for their beloved 16-month-old daughter Clarisse. After three months of daily catastrophic events culminating in this unfathomable loss  she needs support to restructure the future that she and Francois had been building together.Funds raised will cover outstanding medical expenses  and support Clarisse’s education and care. Background:For three months  Francois courageously battled a rare  aggressive cancer of the brain and spinal cord called anaplastic ependymoma. Francois was an acclaimed architect and curator; a pillar of the art and architecture communities in L.A. and Paris; and a big-wave surfer. His work is known for its material innovation  ecological sensitivity  and ethereal beauty. He has taught at universities and exhibited his work worldwide  and published numerous books. He was named a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture in 2018. Francois’s illness was an unforeseen shock that began to escalate just after the holidays.

He endured 8 brain surgeries and 2 spinal surgeries as doctors tried to contain a devastating and rare neurological side effect called low pressure hydrocephalus. This left him unable to walk or function independently—or receive treatment for the underlying cancer itself.The experience has been catastrophic for all involved  but especially for his immediate family.Your thoughtfulness  friendship and support have given Eviana the strength to keep going.

It was a Saturday night and he was going to meet his friends for dinner. As he made his way towards the restaurant  an altercation broke out between two men. Shots were fired. Andy turned to run away but was hit by one of the bullets in his back. He was an innocent victim to a senseless shooting and is now at risk of paralysis from the waist down.After being shot  Andy fell on the ground and immediately noticed that he could not feel his legs. He had the presence of mind to call one of the friends he was meeting for dinner  sent them a drop pin of his exact location  and then called 911. His friends ran to find and help him despite the mayhem all around them and a dead body lying a few feet away. These friends kept Andy calm and safe as the police and ambulances started to arrive.He was taken to SF General Hospital and needed a life-saving operation. The bullet tore his diaphragm  destroyed his spleen and caused significant damage to his spine.Upon waking from the anesthesia  Andy’s first words to friends were: “hassle...hassle mabaril bro” (“it’s such a hassle to be shot bro” in Tagalog). This traumatic event did not take away his courage  dampen his hope  or diminish his strength. Instead of being angry or bitter  Andy has stayed positive and is 100% focused on recovery. He is stable but doctors are not optimistic that he will ever recover use of his legs. His first step towards recovery is moving to a physical rehabilitation center in northern California.While he still does not have any feeling from the waist down  Andy has remained extraordinarily positive. A doctor told him that there was a 90% chance that he was paralyzed -- Andy’s response? “10% is more than I need.” We are (cautiously) hopeful that Andy will be able to walk again and want to help raise the funds needed to get him there. Neurosurgeons have commented that given Andy’s young age  health  positive attitude  and strong support system  he can make meaningful progress and potentially regain mobility during physical rehabilitation. This may take months  or even years  but Andy is completely determined to get back on his feet. More details on Andy’s time at the hospital to-dateAfter his first surgery the night of the shooting  Andy had a second successful operation on Wednesday  March 27. Doctors put screws and rods in his spine to help with reinforcement and stability. He has recovered extraordinarily quickly from these two procedures and was released from the ICU on April 1. Recommended treatmentDoctors have decided that it is safer to leave the bullet lodged in his chest wall (close to the lungs). As a result  they are unable to take an MRI or give a more accurate assessment of spinal damage. Instead of additional surgeries  doctors have recommended that Andy undergo rigorous physical rehabilitation at a leading facility that specializes in traumatic brain and spine injuries in young adults. Physical rehabilitation is the best next step to help Andy recover  become self-sufficient  and hopefully regain mobility.Where your money will goOur goal is to raise $100 000 to help Andy with the following:-- Physical rehabilitation costs that are not covered by insurance. His first round of rigorous physical therapy is estimated at $11k/day for 3 weeks. This will mostly be covered by insurance  but then Andy is expected to spend at least 3-4 sessions per week at another facility (each session estimated at $250/day  for at least 6 months)-- Home care costs (estimated at $100/day  for at least 6 months)-- Special needs due to his new disabilities (e.g.  wheelchair  accessibility adjustments to his home)-- Living expenses / loss of income-- Any other out-of-pocket expenses that he may incur during rehabMore background on AndyAndy is a beloved son  brother  friend  and colleague -- the 20+ visitors per day in the ICU are a testament to that. Given everything that’s happened to him  it would have been completely understandable for Andy to be bitter or angry -- instead  he has spent his days in the ICU becoming friends with staff  entertaining visitors  and looking forward to regaining his strength and mobility.Thank you for reading Andy’s story. We appreciate any help or contribution  no matter how big or small! Please share our campaign link on social media and with your friends. We will keep you posted on the use of funds and his progress going forward. If you have any questions  feel free to contact us directly."

At age 35 this is extremely rare.  (Almost all patients are older than 45. About two-thirds are at least 65 years old. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 71).  We’ve seen 2 different oncologists through Kaiser and felt their treatment plan just wasn’t a right fit. After calling pretty much every major cancer center in the US we ended up meeting with a GI oncologist at Stanford and really liked what he had to say. So  we’re choosing to start a trial at Stanford that Kaiser does not offer. We feel that the best chance to beat this aggressive cancer is with the best  at Stanford. We’ve decided on a treatment plan and hope to get it started in the next week or so. The outpouring of love and support has been nothing short of amazing. I know we have a long hellish road ahead but he’s strong and with the strength of our village I know we’ve got this. Every time my phone goes off it’s a reminder we’re not in this alone and we appreciate all the love and support during this fight. -Jenn Henricksen￼For those of you that do not know Kyle Henricksen personally  here is a short bio of the amazing Husband  Father  Uncle  Son and Friend that he is. His ability to bring laughter to any situation is beyond words. If you need useless trivia or unusual facts  you can always depend on Kyle to inform or entertain you. ￼Kyle and Jenn met through a mutual friend and knew from the very beginning they were meant to be together. Marrying a short time later at the young ages of 20 and 21 the sky was the limit. Shortly after they were married Jenn’s mom passed away and being the selfless people they are  they took on the responsibility of raising Jenn’s little sister Destani (age 5 at the time  now 18) as their own. Just babies themselves they were determined to make it work together. Kyle started his law enforcement career with the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office  after 3 years there he transferred to the Pleasanton Police Department where he has worked to serve and protect and lay his life on the line daily for the last 10 years. Kyle has made many friends along the way but has said his favorite thing about his job is interacting with the community and making people laugh. ￼Zoey (11) and Cohen (9) are Jenn and Kyle’s biological children and their daddy is the light of their lives. But it doesn’t stop there. Kyle lost his brother three years ago to a heart condition and are now raising their niece Alyssa (17) as their own as well. Their hearts are as pure as gold.  ￼Most of their free time is spent with friends that are family. From camping and fishing  to Sunday BBQ’s or just random get togethers. Friends and family are always near. ￼The Henricksen family has always been very giving and put the needs of their family  friends  and loved ones first. It’s our turn to give back to them. There are many people who have asked how they can help  and we all know that medical bills will be very high. 100% of all monies raised will be given to the Henricksen family to be used wherever needed. Kyle is determined to beat this. And we know that the village that surrounds him will be there every step of the way. Here is a small video to make you smile. Zoey and Kyle staying positive. -and a true picture of his fun loving personality. ￼Jenn and Kyle are overwhelmed by the amount of love and support our village has shown them in such a short amount of time. The road will be long and hard  but we will never leave their sides. Here is a thank you message from Kyle and Jenn. ￼#kylekickscancer  #kylesvillage"

He suffered multiple broken bones and a collapsed lung  but the most severe and life altering injury  was the one to his spine. The fractures that Timmy suffered on his spine resulted in a loss of all feeling below his midsection  including the use of his legs.The road ahead is no doubt uncertain  and will have many hurdles for everyone in Timmy’s family. However  despite all of the obvious challenges  Timmy is committed to recovery  and motivated to getting back to being the father  husband  friend and family member that we all know and love.Anyone who knows Timmy and Stacy  knows that they would rather help others than receive help. However  given the gravity of the situation  they are aware that accepting help from others is the only way that they will be able to get through the challenges that lie ahead. One of the biggest financial challenges that they will face  will be adapting their home to be wheelchair accessible. The other substantial financial challenge will be the significant ongoing therapy and medical equipment (i.e. a wheelchair lift  vehicle  etc.) that Timmy will need to adjust to his new life.Although their lives were changed forever  Timmy and his family remain fully committed to his recovery and adapting to their new reality. He and Stacy are eternally grateful for any help that you can give to assist them on this difficult journey.While no one can change the past  we can all help them with their future.

They have taught thousands of students and changed the course of countless lives. They are huge outdoor enthusiasts who have spent their lives camping  canoeing rivers and the Boundary Waters  hiking  backpacking  and always (always!) volunteering with Scouts.Now they are facing the biggest challenge of their lives...and they need your help!In September Gail started experiencing back pain and was being treated for muscle spasms.If only. By November the pain became unbearable and the doctors suspected a compressed disc. If only.Tests were scheduled  but by mid-November Gail’s left leg became numb  and just days afterwards  Gail became paralyzed from the waist down. Mark rushed her to the hospital  where they discovered cancerous tumors on her spine that were pressing on her spinal cord. The situation was dire  and emergency surgery was performed in order to stabilize her spine.  Turns out doctors recommended not starting radiation or chemo after spinal surgery as the bones needed time to heal. So  the focus was on rehab. Gail was transferred to the Acute Spinal Rehab Unit at Valley Med for a serious course of PT and OT. Gail and Mark were feeling positive.But cancer is very inconsiderate - it doesn’t wait for you to recover from surgery or to get final biopsy reports back...it just keeps growing. And growing a heck of a lot faster than anyone suspected. New tumors developed in a different area on Gail’s spine which resulted in losing feeling in her left arm and most of her right arm. Gail was immediately put on a ten-day course of radiation in the hope that the tumors would shrink.Again  If only.It took two months(!!) to get a final diagnosis  sarcoma  a very rare type of cancer that has metastasized throughout Gail’s spine and pelvis. It’s not curable. But  with chemotherapy it is treatable. Chemo treatment finally starts on February 21st and will continue every 4 weeks until...well...that’s a huge TBD.Thanks a lot  sarcoma.Gail was hospitalized for a total of 75 days. She is now home but requires 24/7 care. She is in a wheelchair and cannot stand  walk  or transfer in/out of the wheelchair without assistance. She needs help with personal hygiene  dressing  taking medications  preparing meals  stretching and exercises  and transportation to doctor appointments. Sidebar note to the paralysis...doctors expect it will take about 18 months before they know whether she will be able to fully walk again or regain full use of her arms. That means that  Gail needs a full-time caregiver during the week while Mark is at work. And in case you were wondering  insurance doesn’t cover in-home care. Thanks  insurance company. You never cease to fail us. Way to go.Trained caregivers are expensive. The fee for one month is $5 280.00. That’s more than Gail brought home each month on her teacher’s salary! 18 months at that price  and they are looking at a total of $95 040.00. And that’s only for the cost of the caregiver!! It’s highly doubtful that Gail will be able to go back to work again. They will be down to one teacher’s salary instead of two. In the Bay Area. With two children in college. With a mortgage  and everyday bills. And a caregiver. If only it was “just” cancer.That’s where you come in. They need your help. These two amazingly dedicated  lifelong teachers are in a canoe without a paddle in very uncharted waters.Please donate to Gail’s caregiving fund for however much you can  so that Mark can go to work knowing that Gail has someone at home to provide care and help her regain strength...and at some point  independence.Feel free to pass the link around on email  Facebook  Twitter...Gail and Mark need all the help they can get!!!Here’s the GoFundMe link:If you would rather make a direct donation  please contact Mark or Gail directly.Thanks so much.

While this has been a devastating ordeal  seeing the outpouring of love and support has kept us moving forward. Thank you all eternally for your part in getting him home. We could not have done this without you. I’m going to leave this campaign open to try to help Liz pay off the loans required to finalize the travel as well as his foreign care. Please learn from us and always buy medical travel insurance with an evacuation plan! Love to you all. On January 15th my Dad and his loving wife Liz began what was supposed to be a 5-week vacation to South America. Celebrating Liz’s retirement and their 27th wedding anniversary  it was something they’d looked forward to for months. It was supposed to be the beginning of the rest of their lives together. They celebrated their anniversary on the night of the 18th. That is also the night our world turned upside down. My Dad woke up in the middle of the night  stood up too fast  and passed out. He hit his head hard. Because of the aspirin he was taking for his heart  the doctors tell us the damage to his brain is as severe as that of a helmet-less motorcycle crash victim. He is on life support in the ICU. Stable and infection-free. He can sometimes open his eyes and move all of his limbs. The doctors say the progress will be excruciatingly slow. Months. He is a fighter and we know he will come back to us. He has his dog tags hanging over his head.  As grateful as we are for the excellent care he is receiving  the billing side is awful – relentless and devoid of compassion in badgering Liz to settle up in real time. Sadly  my stubborn father talked Liz out of travel insurance. We’ve already racked up a $127 000 bill after 10 days. There is not an end in sight without getting him back to the US where he will have full coverage and they both will have the support of family and friends. Though a medical evacuation flight (“air ambulance”) has a high price tag  it will be far less than the bill we’d accrue staying in Uruguay. The catch is they require the money upfront. For around $120 000 we can have a LearJet  fully equipped as an ICU room  staffed with providers  and flying at sea level  pick him up in Montevideo  Uruguay and deliver him to Lansing  MI. We really need to get him back home. Please help us raise the funds to do so."

"Medical","November 6, 2018","Help Dasha and Tito","$98,217","$75,000","1,087","5","1.1k","2.8k","MIAMI","FL","I want to tell you about two of the best people I know. And how death came to their door. And how an unexpected medical catastrophe has turned their world upside down. And how  even in the midst of all this  God has not withdrawn his goodness from them. Dasha Hernandez is my wife’s cousin. Family connection aside  Dasha is one of the greatest friends anyone can hope to have. She is a fantastic listener  she is fiercely loyal  and she enriches the lives of everyone who is lucky enough to call her friend. Her husband  Tito  has been there for me more times than I can count. In fact  I should admit that I’ve always found Tito—who is one of my closest friends—utterly fascinating. Here is a guy who is always thinking of others. Always focused on what he can do to make a difference in other people’s lives. What must it be like to think this way? What must it be like to genuinely find joy in prioritizing the needs of others above your own? I honestly have no clue. Tito does. This is the way he lives. This is the way he and Dasha live. Which is what makes what happened to them all the more tragic. Listen to Tito’s first-hand perspective of how that first night unfolded:“God has been so good and His mercies have been endless. As I sit here gathering my thoughts  I am overwhelmed by the depth of His grace and love.On Thursday night (10/25)  Dasha was admitted to Baptist Hospital’s emergency room under dire circumstances. I initially thought she was having a stroke. At least a dozen ER nurses  techs  and doctors worked feverishly to diagnose Dasha. It was immediately evident that every second mattered. For the next several hours  countless hands and eyes were fighting in an operating room for the lives of my wife and unborn daughter  Romy Joy. While attempting to deliver our baby  it was discovered that Dash had severe complications  particularly that her spleen was bleeding  and she was quickly losing blood. According to all three surgeons  her life was hanging by a thread as her body was unable to clot and heal itself. As the Operating Room (OR) team continued to work on Dash  a NICU team of at least a dozen angels worked tirelessly to save our little Romy Joy in the fight for her life. Salvation never came for her beautiful  physical frame  but we rest assured knowing that her eternal salvation was secured in the person of Jesus Christ. And as a track coach  it is relieving to know that my daughter beat me in the only race that truly matters.During this time  Dash lost most of her blood and all of her clotting agents. All medical/chemical attempts to stabilize her in the operating room failed. She went into what is called “disseminated intravascular coagulation” (DIC) in which the body loses all it’s ability to coagulate and blood begins to flow out of every orifice including eyes  ears  nose and even skin pores. My cousin who is a doctor told me that this condition is often referred to in some circles as “death is coming” because the chances of survival are extremely low. BUT GOD had a different plan. In a last ditch effort  they closed her up and rushed her to ICU where for about two hours a team of at least 20 doctors  nurses  and techs worked desperately to save her life. For the first few hours that night I had experienced an inconceivable peace whose source was undeniably God. Although there were brief yet overwhelming waves of time while Dash hung on for her life in ICU that I truly understood the depth of fear and weakness.All I could think of in those moments were  “God  Riley needs her mom way more than she needs her dad. Please help. Please help. Please help.” In His timing  God’s miraculous and merciful hand was undeniable. Dash was critical but inexplicably hanging on. There was a very visible and audible exhale from every one in the ICU room when Dasha stabilized  but there was also a demeanor that the situation was grim. As minutes passed  nurses  technicians  and doctors observed improvements in leaps and bounds. Gloomy expressions turned into stunned and even giddy looks. God was working. As those next few hours unfurled  all I kept hearing was  “This was a miracle.” Personnel from different parts of the hospital that had worked on Dash and even some who only heard of her case were coming by in awe at what God had done. This is not an exaggeration. Between the several family members that I have that work for Baptist Hospital and the many more friends that are also employed by the hospital  we were told that news spread throughout the place of what God had done. Countless nurses and doctors keep telling us that my wife is a living miracle. With each day that passes  new stories continue to be brought to our attention demonstrating unequivocally that our Lord is sovereign and is using this story to shine a light for Jesus into so many lives.”There is an aspect I have not yet shared with you about Dasha and Tito’s situation. An aspect Tito himself did not initially mention to people. In addition to everything else she was going through  Dasha was bleeding profusely from her uterus. This meant that the doctors had no choice but to remove her uterus entirely  along with an ovary  in order to save her life. I ask you to put yourself in their shoes for a moment: Just a few hours prior  Dasha and Tito were thinking about how their lives were going to be different now that their second one was on her way. They have a two-year-old daughter  Riley  who would soon get to be a big sister. And who knows how their family would grow beyond even Riley and Romy—the future allowed for infinite possibilities. Yet it all came crashing down so incredibly fast. From one moment to the next came the realization that Dasha would never again give birth. I am tearing up as I write this  because if you know them like I do  you know how open their hearts are to expanding their little tribe (and knowing Dasha and Tito  they will likely look to adopt a baby girl or boy in the future—these are people who don’t know what it means to be closed off to blessing and loving others). Initially  Dasha did not want to share that she would never again be able to conceive another child of her own. What changed her mind is that she realized this is part of her story  and part of the story of God’s grace and goodness to their family  and that she is nobody to hide anything that God has allowed. On the contrary  she now recognizes that it's an absolutely integral part of the story because it adds to the depth of her and Tito’s human hurt while demonstrating the grandeur of God’s love in the peace and joy He has given them.I want to stress this point a little more in my own words. First  a recap of the situation. Dasha’s spleen ruptured and had to be removed. She suffered a partially collapsed lung. She lost more blood than I thought possible (over 9 whole liters—that’s 2.5 gallons!). She endured a clotting condition to her arm which made it unusable. She lost the daughter that she had told my wife just the other day she couldn’t wait to have and to love and to enjoy forever.  She lost the ability to have future sons or daughters.And yet…two words make all the difference in the world: But God.What Dasha and Tito have told me is not how destroyed or despondent they are—though they know these moments will come. What they have told me is how overwhelmed they are with God’s love. Imagine suffering the way they have  facing the difficulties they now face  and choosing to be grateful  to be thankful to God for his goodness. I am not sure people understand what a radical thing it is to be a Christ follower. You take an event that from an outsider’s perspective is suffused with destructiveness and death and loss  and you choose to see God’s goodness instead. The middle name they selected for their daughter who didn’t make it is “Joy.” She died  and she is associated with the most harrowing episode these two will likely ever experience  but she is Joy. Despite all this  she is Joy. This is fundamentally an act of defiance against the bitterness we’re supposed to feel in response to a loss. There is something revolutionary about Dasha and Tito choosing to interpret their lives as ones very much blessed by the goodness of God. They would say  and in fact they’ve not stopped saying  that God is the one who has given them the strength. But I cannot downplay the reality they now face. I am not a GoFundMe type of person. I have never set one of these up. Yet Dasha and Tito are now staring at unfathomable financial hardship. For days  they had an entire hospital devoted to Operation: Save Dasha And Her Unborn Daughter. In the days that followed  Dasha had an additional surgery and various treatments  and by this point the family has lost count of all the procedures she’s had to endure. For the past couple of years  Dasha has stayed home with Riley  while Tito has worked as a high-school teacher and school chaplain. I shudder to think what they are facing next. The costs that are coming for them are apocalyptic. This is on top of what they have already experienced: They have lost a daughter  they have lost the ability to give birth to future sons and daughters  and they are facing a road to recovery for Dasha that the doctors say will take unbelievable strength. The brutal reality is that an avalanche of costs will soon fall on them.When I asked them if I could set up a GoFundMe  they hesitated. “Everyone’s got financial needs  why should we get resources that people probably need for themselves?” We discussed it and I am happy to say that I convinced them to let me set this page up for them. They realized that they have a very difficult road ahead  and they won’t make it without God blessing them through the goodness of people who hear this story and feel moved enough to help.Let me make my final appeal to you: Please help Dasha and Tito in their time of great need. I promise you that they would do the same for you if the situation were reversed."

A few months after marriage in September  we found out Cathy was pregnant! Starting in July and August  I started having symptoms of constipation  where I would only be able to go #2 every 3-4 days. The pain would build up and last 24-36 hours of extreme pain before I was able to have a bowel movement.  Initially  we both thought it was because we recently got married and were eating out so much with all of our family and friends that have been in town. These episodes of constipation would occur every 2-3 weeks and they felt like they were getting worst even with our change to a healthier diet.Just 2 weeks after we found out we were expecting our first child  I went to see a Gastrointestinal doctor. He put me on a bunch of fiber and it didn't help at all with the constipation. The following week he scheduled me for a colonoscopy where they found a 2 inch tumor in my sigmoid colon.  We were told to cancel our honeymoon plans because treatment would need to start right away.Within just a few days of being given the diagnosis of colon cancer  I was getting CAT scans and PET scans which would confirm that I was Stage 4. They did tell me  that although I was Stage 4 because the tumor had broken through the wall of my colon  it had not spread to any of my other major organs (they just saw some spotting within my abdominal wall).By the time November rolled around  I already had a port-a-cath placed and was getting my first rounds of chemotherapy (Avastin + Oxaliplatin + 5-fu). The doctors had me on a treatment plan to come in every 2 weeks for chemotherapy infusion for about 3-4 hours and then I would wear a pump home that would administer additional chemotherapy over 2 days and then I would come back in to be disconnected from the pump. During this time  Cathy  and I were between doctors appointments (either for her prenatal check-ups or my chemotherapy treatments). Throughout her pregnancy  Cathy  drove me to every single doctors appointments  every scan  and sat by me during every chemo treatment. During her entire pregnancy  I went through 12 rounds of chemo. Emma was born 2 weeks after my final treatment.  The doctors had given me a 5 week break from my last/12th round of chemo so I could spend precious time with Emma.On July 2nd  I went in for my colon resection and to also have the HIPEC procedure done. I was in the hospital for 2 1/2 weeks and was told that surgery went well. They removed a large portion of my colon where the large tumor was  some spots on my small intestine and some spots within my abdominal wall. The surgeons told me that not only did they removed all visible signs of cancer  but the HIPEC should \"clean up\" any left over cancer that may have been missed. They also removed 50 lymph nodes to be sent to pathology and miraculously was told that NONE of them had any evidence of cancer. We thought we were in the clear!Since being discharged on July 17th  I have been following up with my surgeon on a bi-weekly basis. He reassured me that around the 3 month mark is when patients generally start feeling like they're back to normal. While each day my surgical pain was getting better and better (I was using less and less pain meds before stopping altogether)  I noticed my meals and ability to eat were getting smaller and smaller.The 3-month mark came and went and I got to a point where I was  again  completely unable to take anything in without it coming right back up and causing immense pain in my stomach/intestines.Now  here we are today. I have been in the hospital for 2 weeks now. For a week and half  despite numerous scans  x-rays and attempts at an endoscopic procedure  doctors were unable to see any blockage/obstruction that would cause my vomiting. They did see a pocket of fluid and performed a paracentesis to have the fluid analyzed. The results just came back a few days ago and we were given the devastating news that they found malignant cancer cells within that fluid. My surgeon said that although they don't see a tumor on any of the scans  the presence of those cells is indicative of the tumor growing somewhere and that it is most likely the cause of my inability to eat. He said surgery is not an option because of 1) the fact that I have quite a bit of scar tissue from my first surgery  2) he's not sure he would even be able to cut it all out  3) he's not sure that my body could handle surgery at this point and also 4) that surgery would delay any sort of chemotherapy treatment (if that were an option). I was told to follow up with my oncologist to see if he has a plan of attack. My surgeon has said that it will definitely not be the same chemotherapy I was given in the past as it clearly didn't work. He also prepared us for the possibility that there might not be a treatment option as my cancer seemed to be resistant to treatment.Since my initial diagnosis on October 11th  2017  I have lost about 50lbs  I have been poked with a needle more times that I can even count  I've spent nearly every week at a doctors appointment  I haven't been able to hold my baby girl since she was first born due to the pain and just my general weakness from the weight loss and inability to eat. I am currently living off a TPN and can't take in anything orally without vomiting.I started my own business 3 years ago and my wife and I both work from home. Since all of this  the time we've been able to work has slowly declined to now stopping altogether. Cathy spends the days here with me at the hospital and then rushes home to be with Emma at night. All of our savings has gone towards medical treatments and we've had to start putting things on credit cards. We are currently in the negative and have no idea what other medical expenses may lie ahead.Our Goal with this Go Fund Me campaign is to help pay for our current medical debt  upcoming medical bills with the new year and provide financial support for our family during this difficult time so we can concentrate on spending as much time as we can together without worrying about our medical bills that are piling up.In addition  we hope each and everyone shares our story to as many people as we can in hopes of a miracle treatment we are not aware of. Thank you for taking the time to read our story."

Each round requires a stay of one to two months at Cedars Sinai Hospital  with two to three weeks at home recovering between rounds. It is also possible she will need a bone marrow transplant. Anyone who has met Sandy knows she is a champion fighter. Her doctors stress this is a curable cancer.  She’s doing well  and of course she’s befriended the entire hospital staff and her many brilliant doctors.  Everyone there is wowed by the indomitable spirit and charm that we all already know as our wonderful Sandy  even in the face of this diagnosis. But the months ahead will be long and grueling.Many have asked what they can do for Sandy and her girls  and you have already been unbelievably generous in a thousand different ways. Though it’s extremely humbling for Sandy to accept your help (or even allow us to ask)  what she truly needs now is financial assistance. The bills are overwhelming  with everything from rent and household expenses  to the medical bills and her health insurance premiums. And as a freelancer  Sandy has no paid sick leave or disability benefits. If we can raise enough for Sandy to cover this year that she’s unable to bring in any income  she can more fully concentrate on the priority of getting healthy and strong.Thank you so much for contributing  and thank you  too  for your positive vibes  prayers  candle lighting  spiritual meditations and all the other ways in which you are sending Sandy courage and your love. Your friendship and support mean everything to her.P.S. Please feel free to share the link to Sandy’s Fund by email or text with others who know Sandy or might want to help out.

With this diagnosis there have been multiple rounds of chemotherapy and surgeries  too many ER visits to count  hospital stays  and so much more. A roller coaster ride that no-one wants to take! With all the ups and downs  Adam had a short period of remission in 2016  with it only to reemerge again in 2017 and be one of the worst ensuing time of their lives.  This  unfortunately  is their \"normal\".  They have endured more than any one family should ever have to  and they have fought with such grace  dignity and courage.  This is an incredible family! Adam is a father to 3 boys  a husband to his wife Jodi  a son  a brother  an uncle  a great friend to many  but most of all  Adam is a fighter!  He has spent this past year in and out of hospitals  unable to eat due to bowel obstruction  connected to nutrients bags  and unable to work at all since October 2017 at Montgomery Animal Hospital  where he has spent his life as a favored Veterinarian  passionately caring for and healing animals .  All Adam should be doing right now is focusing on his health and putting all his energy into getting better each and every day. And his wife  Jodi  has been nothing short of amazing and the rock of the family  and all she should be doing right now is caring for Adam and their three teenage boys. This family  to no fault of their own  have had an unimaginably painful journey with cancer for over 6 years now.  On numerous occasions  friends and family members have wanted to start some sort of fundraising campaign to help the Jaffe's with the astronomical costs associated with Adam's treatments and illness over these many years.  In one instance just late last year  Adam had to be taken by helicopter from Montgomery General to UMMC for experiencing a blood sugar level over 1200 (brought on by a new drug which only happens in 1% of trial patients) followed by 12 nights in Neuro ICU  you can only imagine what that one bill would amount to.  Adam has not gone to work nor had income in over a year and prior to that was a day to day determination if he felt well enough to go in.  Since he's unable to work  their only option for their business has been to hire relief vets at emergency rates to maintain their animal hospital.  Therefore he has not taken a paycheck in a year to cover those expenses.  They are desperately looking for a full time veterinarian  so maybe someone reading this might have a lead.  When you have your health and you're able to work  just paying the bills can be taxing  such as the mortgage and college tuition   so with Adam's illness and having all those normal responsibilities  in addition to heaping medical bills  it can take a real toll not only on the body and mind  but your finances. We know GoFundMe is such a good avenue for all their friends  family  co-workers  clients  neighbors and the anonymous do gooders to help lift some of the burden in a significant way! Please keep them in your prayers as they continue to battle this disease and the domino effects that it brings.  So for all of you that are taking a moment to read this  first and foremost thank you so much  and secondly  when you're considering helping  imagine a life where you can't eat real food for almost a year. Take what you would normally spend just in one day for food  25  50  100  200  500; no amount is too small and no amount is too big! This is a family that deserves every penny but hasn't asked for a cent. So we  the Jaffe Don't Stop Believin' team  their friends  are asking! Please help us in lifting some of the financial burden off of this family. And if you can't help financially we completely understand and just ask that you share the Jaffe's story and forward this link to whomever you think could be of help.We thought it would be nice to start this campaign on a very special day  January 14th  Adam's 48th birthday. We can not think of a better gift than to try and raise money for this very deserving family so they can put their energy towards the continued fight to better health! Don't Stop Believin'!!!Thank you! Dina  Chris  Mary and Cori"

Their young dreams have been put on hold as they undergo aggressive chemotherapy. On top of that  they are struggling to pay for medical bills  ongoing treatment  care for their three year old son and every day living. Please contribute if you can and read on for their full story...A Beautiful Beginning Heather and Jason met at church and fell deeply in love in 2008. They were married in 2009 and together  embody grace  resilience and optimism. They describe each other as “best friends” and “forever sweethearts”. In 2015  they welcomed their beautiful son  Lucian into the world. Heather motivates and heals others through her professional personal training business. Jason inspires people across the world through his renowned art. And Lucian is a happy  sweet preschooler who loves his caring parents.Together  they love going on road trips and want to live to take their son hiking someday on the John Muir trail. A Tragic Double DiagnosisUnthinkably  both Jason and Heather have both been diagnosed with aggressive cancers in the last year. And now they are fighting for their lives.Last May  Jason was in pain from a headache that wouldn’t go away  so Heather took him to the emergency room.  Soon after  doctors diagnosed Jason with glioblastoma multiforme- an often fatal form of brain cancer. Heather and Jason have faced the battle for Jason’s future with their characteristic optimism and grace. But over Thanksgiving and Christmas  Heather struggled with increasing abdominal pain and fatigue. Last week  Heather found out that her pain was caused by pancreatic cancer. The Road AheadJason had part of his tumor removed and needs continuing chemo and scans every 8 weeks to monitor the tumors that remain. He and Heather are hopeful that a new FDA-approved drug will help Jason live a longer life with his tumors. Meanwhile  Heather is starting a six-month course of aggressive chemo and will have surgery to remove her tumor soon. These treatments will increase her chance of survival  but are not a cure. The Challenges Continue Because of their ongoing treatment needs  Heather and Jason’s continuing medical and financial challenges are significant. Both the Brinkerhoffs are self-employed. Jason’s surgery has left him unable to drive  and continuing his work as an artist is difficult. Heather won’t be able to work for at least the next six months while she undergoes chemotherapy. They have a small  two-bedroom house with a kitchen that needs significant work done in order for it to be functional. There isn’t a place for Heather’s parents or other caregivers to sleep. It’s essential for them to have necessary renovations to their house so that they can accommodate the full-time caregivers they need. We Need Your HelpHeather  Jason and Lucian need your help to fight for their future together. We (their family and friends) are trying to raise $130 000 to cover: - Essential ongoing medical treatments- Help with living expenses while they are unable to work during treatment - Care for their son Lucian- Major home repairs - Transportation costsNo amount you can give is too small.

Early Sunday morning on November 18  2018 around 4 am  16 year old Cecily was sleeping over at a friend’s house in Orinda and a fire erupted. Cecily thankfully escaped. We are heartbroken that her friend did not survive. Cecily is the Miramonte High School teenager you may have heard about and reported in the news who survived the fire  but she was critically injured. She is unfortunately in Bothin Burn Center in San Francisco  being treated for 2nd and 3rd degree burns on 35% of her body. She is still in critical condition and is expected to be in the hospital for months. Cecily is a beautiful  sweet  bright  talented  sensitive  and incredibly gifted young girl. Her accomplishments are so impressive. She dreams of changing the world - radically. While many 16 year old girls are worrying about dating and learning to drive  Cecily is intently intellectual with a passion for existential philosophy and French policial rock music. She volunteers and helps disadvantaged and at risk youth in Oakland with their homework. Cecily finds great joy in ballet and studies at Oakland Ballet School. Cecily is a National Latin Scholar and studies the Russian Language. She is feisty and challenges everyone in the logical and moral underpinning of their ideas. That fighting spirit  along with everyone’s prayers and well wishes  is what’s keeping her going right now. She is a witty jokester and was telling jokes to the EMTs in the ambulance despite being critically injured. She is even joking now through hand signals and scrawled notes since she can’t speak with the breathing tube she needs. She was just about to perform as Louise in this year’s OBS Nutcracker  which was something she had been working hard for for years. A HUGE fan of K-Pop  Cecily is a member of the BTS Army. Cecily absolutely loved seeing them whenever they came to the US. Any donated amount would help Cecily and the family focus on getting Cecily whatever medical treatment necessary to save and improve her quality of life. If you are unable to donate  we would very much appreciate any prayers or warm thoughts for Cecily and if possible  sharing this link with your family and friends. On behalf of the Bartsch family  we thank you all for your kind words  prayers  warm thoughts  offers to help  and kindness. We will keep you posted on her progress. Cecily is having the first of potentially six surgeries this morning  November 20th. Your continued prayers are very much appreciated..."

Danielle’s life however  came to sudden crossroads in early February of 2019.Just before her 30th birthday  Danielle was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with an advanced malignant neoplasm of the placenta.  Also known as Choriocarcinoma. The cancer is a result of her previous pregnancy 8- months prior where cancer cells from the placenta metastasized into her liver  lungs and pancreas. She is now in a battle for her life.This all started  as Danielle and I were traveling from Rhode Island to Florida with mom  dad and two close friends. We also had exciting news  Danielle is pregnant again! We were so excited to know our family will be growing. Danielle even bought a big sister shirt for Claire to surprise our family and friends. The reactions were priceless.Our vacation was one for the memory books.  All the while Danielle  my strong wife was fighting through nausea  cramping and every symptom we thought was from being pregnant. One day it became too much and we took her to the emergency room.We discovered that she had cancer and the tumors in her body increase levels of the pregnancy hormone HCG. The excitement we thought was new life turned out to be a false positive.Danielle's immediate emergency was life threatening internal bleeding. The shock we felt was unbearable. Danielle who just a few days prior was swimming with her daughter in a pool for the first time  may lose her life. However  Danielle did slowly show signs of recovery from the internal bleeding after emergency surgery and support from medical treatments.Danielle in the past weeks has battled through two surgeries  severe jaundice  intubation  a tracheotomy  a hospital transfer by helicopter  full body skin rashes  dialysis and much more.  She fights each day to be healthy and stable enough to receive the chemotherapy.  Right before her first surgery  she told her family and I “Don’t worry  I got this.” I remind her every day that she told me this to keep her spirits up. Seeing her every day  I still cannot imagine what she is going through.Currently  we travel each day 4 hours or more to the hospital in Miami  Fl. The rising costs of treatment  travel  child care and being away from home in Rhode Island are beginning to take a toll. I am unable to work due to our location and Danielle is not able to work because of her condition.  Doctors have told us she will require months of treatment in the hospital. I am asking you to help my family fight our way back home by donating. May God bless you for your generosity and prayers. These funds will go a long way to helping my family heal in this trying time. Love from Dan  Danielle  Claire and Blaise."

This time her prognosis is a lot scarier and she needs your help!￼￼THE PLANAfter undergoing major surgery (a second time) to remove as many of the mixed Germ Cell tumors as possible in early October 2018  Noel has to move from Chicago to Indianapolis on October 24  2018 for two months for treatment. She will be doing high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplants at Indiana University Medical Center under the supervision of Dr. Einhorn and Dr. Adra (Lance Armstrong's doctors).Noel's treatment involves 20 days of consecutive in-patient HDCT (High Dose Chemotherapy) with a 5 day break  and then 20 days again of HDCT. This will be 10x stronger and more debilitating than her last bought with chemotherapy. The two chemotherapy drugs they plan to give her are Carboplatin and Etopocide. This will be at a very high dosage in hopes of obliterating the cancer that is still in her abdomen and saving her life.Luckily  her surgery went better than anticipated. She was operated on (for a second time) by Dr. Lurain at Northwestern. Her chances of survival went from 15% to 70% in about a week's time after we met with Dr. Einhorn's team at IU. All that said  her family is extremely optimistic. Noel is extremely optimistic and strong. Everyone is geared up for the tough journey ahead with all of the faith in the world that Noel will overcome this and be cured from this terrible disease. But they need help...THE FINANCIAL REALITYAside from this cancer recurrence being extraordinarily scary  Noel and her husband  Rob  are running into financial issues as both of them had to quit their jobs. Noel was an assistant store manager for a high end fashion consignment store and Rob worked in television production on the FOX show Empire. Therefore  they decided to launch this GoFundMe in hopes of raising money to help support them during this difficult time over the next three months. Rob will not return to work until the end of January 2019. WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?rent.The whole family will have to move to Indianapolis  but their landlords in Chicago (CA Urban Living) will not let them out of their lease. The cost of their current apartment is $3 175/month. They are all paid up through October but need help by November 1  2018. This is their biggest cost. They were not expecting their landlords to not let them out of their lease during a life and death emergency. The lease goes until April 1  2018. Furthermore  Noel's mother and sister are moving to Indianapolis with Leia to be close by. The cost per month is $3 000. Total = $18 525(Update 10/19: Thanks to Nate Cooper and Eric Juster  we are likely going to get out of our Chicago lease November 1  2018!!!)food.$200/week for groceries x 12 weeks is $2400. Noel's mother and sister are moving down to Indianapolis with Noel's 17 month old daughter  Leia  so this includes diapers and food for Leia.Total = $2 400health insurance.Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois costs $1300/month (until Dec 25  2018) then it will go up to $1500/month via Cobra.Total = $4 100medical bills. Out of pocket medical costs not covered by insurance will be at least $7 000.Total = $7 000car.Their car payment is $259/month and insurance is $93/month. Total = $1 056Grand Total = $33 081*We decided to bump our goal to $50 000 after friends and family suggested we should. We are beyond grateful for all of your donations big and small. Thank you for sharing our story. It is working!***11/3 Update: we’ve decided to up our goal again to $100 000. Our new trajectory has a 42 week chemotherapy schedule (14 cycles). It’s a long road ahead. Thank you for your continued support!**￼￼￼THE BOTTOM LINENoel is a loving mother and wife. She loves fashion  chocolate chip cookies  and all things Bravo. She's caring  intelligent  and gorgeous. Throughout all of this (this time and last) she's been a warrior. What saddens her most about this process is not being able to hold her daughter. Not being able to be 100% \"mom\" -- a job she was born to be. Her and her family are confident in this treatment plan and extraordinarily optimistic. Anything you can do to help them is appreciated  whether that be a donation or simply sharing this page on your social media channels. Please follow and tag @the_fighting_phoenix on Instagram or use the hashtag #thefightingphoenix so we can get the word out.

She is 25 years old and perfectly healthy and that morning she abruptly suffered a massive stroke leaving her unconscious and requiring part of her brain and skull to be removed in two risky brain surgeries. Her family is in India  while she is in the US  and due to her delicate condition she cannot be moved closer to them. With your support  we can ensure she gets the care she needs to return to health.  Sriharsha Thakur is an ambitious  independent woman  who always wanted to stand on her own two feet. Her friends know her as a friendly  caring and fun loving person. She comes from a lower middle class family in India and was a bright student who worked hard to come to the US and pursue her Masters in Computer Science. She had just begun her career with the hopes of providing a better life to her family and repaying her educational loans.  But little did she know that on one random day  her dreams would be ripped away and life put in danger. December 8  2018  started out as a typical Saturday for Sriharsha  spending time with her closest friends and looking forward to the Holidays and New Year.  But her friends witnessed her life completely change in a split second that morning when she suffered a massive Ischemic stroke (which is caused by a blood clot blocking the artery that leads to the brain).  The doctors had to perform two brain surgeries to remove part of her skull and dead brain to relieve pressure in her brain to get her out of fatal danger.  In a few months she will require another brain surgery to put the skull back in place. The stroke has left her without speech or the use of her left side  including her neck  hand  and leg. It also affected her ability to swallow  requiring use of a feeding tube. It will take at least a year of rehabilitation to learn how to talk  walk  eat  and regain general function. She may never get back the life she was living before the stroke but the doctors are hopeful that with the right support  Sriharsha can pull through.Sriharsha needs financial support for rehabilitation  home nursing  medical equipment  and uncovered medical expenses. We have set up this fund in the hopes of raising money to help Sriharsha get back on her feet. Every donation  however small  is going to help re-build her future. She is very resilient and we are all optimistic that she can have a successful recovery. Sriharsha  her family and friends would love for your support with any donations  prayers  and positive vibes."

Recently  the youngest Lane  Weston  was diagnosed with a rare  high-risk  and aggressive form of cancer called Neuroblastoma. When Kristin took Weston to the doctor  Kristin mentioned her concern over a small bump that had appeared on Weston’s head. The doctor decided to do a biopsy and it was discovered that the bump was a metastasized tumor on Weston’s skull. What began as a routine doctor’s visit became a day no parent should have to face. Because only the metastasized tumor has been found  Weston will have to undergo further testing to discover where the cancer originated from. What we know right now is that for Weston’s age and for the severity of the tumor found  the Lanes have a difficult journey ahead of them. Weston may need to undergo various operations and rounds of chemotherapy and radiation over the next two years. While insurance will cover much of Weston’s health-related expenses  further health and outside expenses  such as travel to and from the hospital  lodging  etc.  are a large burden on such a young family. This GoFundMe has been set up for us to come together as a family and help the Lanes offset the daily expenses that will come with Weston’s treatment  allowing them to focus on what’s most important: supporting and helping Weston through this trial. As more information is provided  this page will continue to be updated. With the donations collected on this page  Kristin and Sam will be able to stick with Weston and a small but significant burden can be lifted off their shoulders.

I am a former Division 1 basketball player from Bowling Green State University and former Marian Catholic Spartan. On December 15  2017  I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. MS is a  autoimmune disease often a disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain  and between the brain and body.  And just a few weeks after the diagnosis  the lower half of my body shut down and from January 5th- February 2nd of 2018 I was hospitalized. Shortly after being diagnosed I was unable to walk  move any part of my lower body  including my toes. Having a numb and tingling sensation cover my body from the tip of my toes all the way up to my bra-line. I experience bladder problems  pain on my spinal cord and back. I also suffered from abdominal pain  swallowing problem  speech issues  blurred vision and had weakness and tingling in my fingers and legs. I also have pain and muscle spasms in my legs. While I have the MS that comes and goes  it has been over a year  we have been trying every medication  every treatment and nothing but dieting and physical therapy seem to be helping.Miraculousy  here in Chicago  there is a doctor who specializes in severe cases of MS. This doctor who’s background is in stem cell research for patients with severe cases of autoimmune diseases like myself. Basically the transplant would suppress my immune system with a high-dose chemo therapy and my stem cells are taken out  harvested while I am in the hospital  then my stem cells are given back to me and it will regenerate and rebuild my attacked immune system  hault my symtoms and take me off all MS medication.This transplant is a life-changing opportunity that normally would be covered by insurance but because of how severe my disease is insurance won’t cover the cost of the transplant. I have already seen this doctor and his team and he believes I can benefit from a transplant  because I am young but I just need to keep progressing and somehow be covered for the transplant. With the costs of MS treatments  medicine  appointments  MRI’s  hospitalizations and misc. medical bills we have already spent so much. My family and I need your help getting my life back. As a former athlete you can imagine having everything taken from me so abruptly at a young age  fighting every day just for some new progress is beyond tough. Please  please  please consider helping and donating to the cost of the transplant. It is a one time payment of $125 000. I can’t express enough how life-changing this opportunity is and that I have been blessed enough to be considered for. My family and I from the bottom of our hearts genuinely appreciate your kindness and love no matter the amount. Thank you for your support/prayers and God bless."

A trip to the pediatrician lead to lots of questions and the suggestion of a trip to Children’s Hospital for some blood work. After hours of waiting  we received the diagnosis- leukemia.  We were floored. Jack is a healthy kid who is always looking out for the well being of others.  He doesn't like or need to be taken care of. We are now faced with a life challenge.  Jack is a fighter but what has been explained to us is that we are embarking on a 3+ year journey with the hopes of a recovery.  Jack will have intense chemo followed by many more years of additional chemo and other treatments.  Doing what is right and best for Jack won't be easy. It isn't something we saved up for and are scared of what it will mean to our family.  His health is our priority.  The facility he will be treated at is 30 miles from our house so that adds to the costs and stress. Any help provided will be used to offset the enormous bills we have been told are coming. We were told the first bills are just weeks away.  We are optimistic and hopeful that Jack will recover and are appreciative of any support we will receive. Jack (on the left) spends his free time volunteering with Expand  Boulder's program to help special needs kids. He is a partner with the Special Olympics helping out wherever he can. Jack has a HUGE heart and is a wonderful kid.  Thank you Daniel & Tricia"

Ray ported Python so that it could be cross-compiled using MinGW-w64/GCC to be hosted on Windows  built on GNU/Linux as part of a complete toolchain build for final embedding into GDB. This was a requirement for Qt Creator debuggers to work correctly.  He then released his own version of the Google Android NDK using the above GDB/Python work. These were the first NDK toolchains released to run natively on Windows (rather than being Cygwin based)  to support ARM Neon and to be based on the Linaro Android GCC sources. Subsequently this work  including the Python port was merged to Google's upstream Android source code repositories.  Ray co-founded the MSYS2 project. The project ported ArchLinux's Pacman to Windows and maintains 'PKGBUILD' recipes and patches for more than 1000 Open Source software packages. MSYS2 is now the recommended upstream or build environment for many Open Source projects  Git for Windows  Rust  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler  Gnome and KiCad among them.   Since joining Anaconda  Inc. in February 2016  Ray has done a huge amount of work to propel the Anaconda Distribution forward.  Most notably  he was responsible for the great leap forward in our compilers with the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release. In case you missed it  this blog post  highlighted the performance and security improvements.  Ray managed to wear out his keyboard from the amount of effort he put into the Anaconda Distribution 5.0 release! Ray is responsible for the development of the R and MRO conda packages.  He is also the one the Anaconda Distribution team relies on whenever it comes to tricky compiler issues.  On many occasions  he has tracked a tricky bug into assembly code and fixed it. He has made numerous patches to address CVE vulnerabilities.  He has managed to jump through crazy hoops at times to ensure that the Anaconda Distribution remains compatible with the widest range of systems and hardware. Whatever the challenge  he has remained a critical member of the team who supports his fellow teammates.  In spite of his remarkable ability and contributions  Ray is very humble  hardworking and affable.  Despite his daunting condition  he remains upbeat and incredibly dedicated to continuing his work and open-source contributions.  Ray has undergone treatment in the UK since his diagnosis in March.  Unfortunately  the doctors there believed operating on Ray’s tumors would be too risky to attempt.  Ray obtained a second opinion at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  TX  where they believe surgery is both possible and advisable.  Here’s the catch: with immigration laws and health insurance policies  we can’t get Ray covered for his operation to happen at M.D. Anderson.  To give Ray the best chance at surviving this  we want to pitch in and help him obtain the best care possible.Since he has given so much to the Anaconda community and the broader open source community - we want to give others the opportunity to help him as well.  In recognition of Ray’s vast contributions to our community  and in the hopes of helping him beat cancer  please join us in contributing towards his treatment.  Contributions here will be matched 1:1 up to $50 000 by Anaconda  Inc.  Ray has an immediate need for funds leading to surgery in the beginning of December  and will have an ongoing need for continuing treatment afterwards."

Initial information from Neurology indicates that he may be in a coma for about a month or longer. When he comes out of a coma  he will have a long road to recovery  needing to rehab both his brain and body. If you're lucky enough to know Sean  you know that he's always quick with a snarky comment  a glass of whiskey  and a good laugh. He's infinitely warm and loving  always taking care of the people around him and remembering birthdays so well that it puts everyone else to shame. I could write forever about the kind of soul that Sean is  but my favorite thing about him is how much he adores his daughter  Adeline. Super Dad doesn't even begin to cover it. When Addie was in elementary school  the favorite parts of his day were walking her to school in the mornings and walking her home in the afternoon  talking to her about her day. Sean will have a few more surgeries in the short term and we won't know the extent of his brain damage until he wakes up. We are uncertain of the full extent of the expenses associated with his recovery  but these funds will be used towards his hospital costs  rehabilitation costs  any costs associated with outfitting his house with a ramp and other accessibility needs  and caring for Adeline.

As conventional treatment offered no hope  she turned to reputable alternative treatments but kept on working as best she could from home as she is a translator to keep up an income. In December her condition turned critical and her sister Akari (a Mum of 3 boys  separated from her husband and living in America) came to Japan to support Uri  she realised drastic measures needed to be taken.  Akari rallied family  cousins and friends support to scrape together the $51 000 USD plus airfares to get Uri in to the Hope for Cancer clinic in Mexico and she stayed with Uri in Mexico for another 10 days until she came through some critical stages. But she then needed to get back to attend her children and start to prepare a space where she lives for Uri to come home to after her intensive treatment.She checked in to the clinic on December 29thand just in time to have life-saving stent surgery to unblock her kidney function. This cost another $6 000 they are yet to find with speciality surgeon follow up and treatment already beyond another $1500.The current estimates of future basic follow up treatment is another $25 000 USD plus airfares and covering all her own rental & usual living expenses without an income as she cannot work at the moment and currently needs a wheel chair for getting around.  Thankfully  with all the treatment and the tireless support of her sister Akari  Uri has jumped through some hoops and is doing everything possible to heal. If she can continue these treatments she has a real chance to heal from this nightmare.  But with her family’s funds already all but gone  they really need urgent financial  help and her sister Akari will also now be her full time Carer as well when Uri checks out of the clinic next Monday. The clinic doctors in Mexico will monitor and support for a year but from a distance and in correspondence with local clinics Uri will need to connect with in the area her sister lives. It is still undecided whether her best next step is to be in Japan where certain of the medications she needs are less expensive  or with her sister in Chicago where she has personal support and someone close to care for her. Either way  she will be facing way more than the current $30K USD of medical bills due this next week!!  So we have set a goal for 100K USD. Any and all funds donated to Uri will go directly to her sister Akari in Chicago  who is taking care of everything for Uri  including paying for all. Akari will also need to fly to Mexico on Monday to bring Uri home as well as she cannot fly without aid. Uri is one of the most giving  and loving people I know and is the first to help others. She was not comfortable with this idea at first but she realises that if she is to live  she needs to be willing to receive. So from the bottom of our hearts thank you for any size donation you can manage. Every cent counts and is appreciated more than any words can convey.  Naturally  all healing thoughts and prayers are also so deeply received and appreciated.  This kind of support from our greater global family will make it possible for Uri and Akari to focus more fully on helping Uri heal.  We will send regular updates on Uri’s progress. Thank you! Extra information from Uri’s ‘support sisters’ who set up this campaign.To the amazingly generous \"Earth Angels\" taking time to read this  thank you. We (Uri’s closest friends) have set up this GoFundMe page in the hope that  with your generous help  we can take some of the financial pressures  stress and strains off Uri and her family whilst she goes through life saving treatments  surgeries and recovery.   The money will go directly to paying for the life-saving surgeries  both past & future  specific medications for the type of cancer Uri has  the kidney dialysis and related treatments and to help cover some of the mounting monthly costs of consultant appointments  scans  pre and post-operative care  travel costs and all the other ‘unseen’ bills that seem to come out of now where at these times.  We will keep you updated on here status and the doctor’s decision on where her treatment will be best catered for from next week.Whatever the donation you can manage  we cannot thank you enough and tell you how incredibly appreciated it is by Uri and all her family as well.

Jaylen was working towards his goal to be an entrepreneur and provide for himself and others.Jaylen was working hard  like any other day. He was working to pay his bills and provide for his young family. Unfortunately  what started as a normal day as an Amazon driver  quickly redefined his life forever. Jaylen's life was altered when he was shot in the back after an altercation over a handicap parking space in the Target parking lot on March 5  2019. The ideas  goals and aspirations that he was working towards were ripped away from him  leaving him to forge a new life  much different from the one he had planned. Jaylen now remains hospitalized due to a gun shot wound  resulting in a T8 spinal cord injury. At this time  Jaylen has no feeling from his abdomen through to his lower extremities. Because his spine was severed at this level  it is unlikely that Jaylen will be able to regain the motor and sensory functions to allow him to walk or run to chase after his little boy. Jaylen and his team of doctors are not yet certain on what exactly Jaylen's physical limitations will be.Due to not having health insurance  we are raising money on Jaylen's behalf to cover the exorbitant costs of medical treatment. This treatment will include procedures and months of rehabilitation. In addition  this money will be beneficial for Jaylen as he works through his recovery process and adapts to his new way of life. Any contributions made will be pivotal to Jaylen's recovery.

Whether in a yoga studio  kayaking  or meal prepping healthy dishes  Erika has always been the absolute epitome of health. On a daily basis  you will surely find her with a green smoothie in hand and a captivating smile on her face  which is why this diagnosis comes as a complete shock to her and everyone around her. Now  at the ripe age of 25  Erika is about to embark on the fight of her life as she combats cancer that has spread beyond her breast into several of her lymph nodes and liver. Luckily  change and challenges aren't unfamiliar to Erika and she is a natural born fighter. Just 3 years ago  she uprooted her life from Pittsburgh to move to Nashville without a network  a defined career or family. She worked tirelessly teaching yoga  building her meal prep business and tapping into the real estate space all without ever asking for an ounce of help. However  now as an independent Realtor and Meal Prep Chef  her income will essentially cease to exist once she starts treatment because it'll be too physically demanding. Erika is no stranger to struggling or hustling to make ends meet  but now it is time for her to rest and focus solely on her treatment/ridding her body of this aggressive cancer. Now more than ever  Erika NEEDS our HELP...Erika’s specific type of breast cancer is HER2-positive. It is a more aggressive type of breast cancer  but it is also a form of breast cancer that thankfully responds well to Targeted Gene Therapy. Our primary goal and wish is that Erika will begin a clinical trial this month with a promising new drug that will ultimately attack her tumors very specifically.She has a very long road ahead  but she knows that \"SHE'S got this\" and \"WE got this\"!The funding from your contributions will go directly towards assisting Erika with basic living expenses  groceries  prescription costs  uninsured medical expenses  medical co-pays  and any other needs directly related to her care.With her family all the way in Pennsylvania  her friends and family are pulling together to help support her through this next chapter and unknown journey ahead.

He was taken to the emergency room where a CT scan revealed a mass on his brain  and was immediately flown by helicopter to Swedish Medical Center in Denver. On August 15 he had brain surgery to successfully remove 95% of the tumor from his right front lobe. On September 5  Paul began six weeks of daily chemotherapy and radiation at the Shaw Cancer Center in Edwards  Colorado  and just at the time he finished up that process and should have begun to feel better  on October 29 he was rushed back to Swedish Medical Center with loss of movement on his left side. The new MRI showed signs of recurrence in the tumor and resulted  in Paul being placed on steroids and Avastin treatments every 2 weeks.  He is currently waiting to undergo the next MRI scheduled for Dec 17. In the interim  he and Mary traveled to Dana Farber in Boston to investigate alternative forms of treatment and various trial programs to try and develop the best course of action for his disease. The Financial SituationThrough all this  Paul has tried to maintain his happy personality and continue pursuing his passion and livelihood as a renowned architect.  Unfortunately  as the treatments progressed and his energy waned  he lost his ability to practice architecture and thus has been unable to continue his role as the primary provider for his family.  As happens with many of us  he did not foresee this cruel twist in his health and does not have life insurance policy in place. As if the heartbreak of Paul’s diagnosis and inability to practice architecture isn’t bad enough  the loss of steady income coupled with mounting medical bills has put a tremendous financial burden on our amazing Miller Family. Paul  Mary  Windham and Siena need our collective help paying medical bills to ensure Paul continues to receive the care he needs.  Team Miller is incredibly grateful for any and all help… through Go Fund Me or any First Bank in Colorado.

She's my \"person\"--the one who's always in my corner and the one who can tell me when I'm being a jerk.  That friend who celebrates my highs and crawls in the hole with me for my lows. ￼She's 39 years old and a mother to Shyla  the most amazing 5 year old I have ever met.￼A week ago  we were talking about light fixtures and furniture for the fixer-upper home she just bought in September with the love of her life  Dustin  and laughing about how living without a kitchen wasn't really affecting her since she doesn't like to cook.Two days later  we were talking about cancer. Her cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer--which I would later learn is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that isn't even discovered until you're already in stage 3 or 4. The news brought me to my knees. Immediately  I thought of my \"niece\" and the possibility that she could live a life without my friend as her mother. The air left my lungs. Google offered no solace--this cancer is a relentless bitch.The days since have been a whirlwind--a biopsy confirmed she has a malignant tumor in her breast and an ultrasound revealed the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. We held our breath for the next few days while we waited for the results of an MRI of her brain  a bone scan and a CAT scan--all done to determine if this rapidly advancing cancer has spread to any of her other organs.Miraculously  the other tests have given us good news. It appears that the cancer is centralized to her breast and lymph nodes  which gives us a glimmer of hope in a somewhat grim diagnosis. Yesterday  the chemo port was implanted in her chest  and it all became real. This fight is going to take everything she has  and it won't be easy--4 months of chemo  followed by a mastectomy  and then months of radiation.Two nights ago  she had to share the news with her 5 year old daughter. Shyla has an ACTIVE imagination (you should hear this kid tell a story)  so Tracy thought it was best to be honest with her. She told her about mommy's cancer and that she would be getting medicine that would make her lose her hair. \"The talk\" went well  and shortly after Shyla appeared with this picture she drew for her mom:￼￼As Shyla explained  this is a checklist. The top picture shows Tracy now  then a bald Tracy when her hair falls out. The third picture is the medicine  then a picture of Tracy with her hair growing back. And the last picture is Tracy \"when Mommy can do anything.\" The boxes will be checked off as Tracy goes through each stage.I told you...the kid's brain is unbelievable.Tracy has an incredible support system--her fiance  Dustin  her parents  siblings and extended family  and a huge network of friends. What she doesn't have is the means to cover all her medical bills.  She is a straight commission salesperson  so if she's not working  she's not making money  and she will not be able to do her job while she battles this. So  her income will stop effective immediately. Dustin will also lose income as he makes sacrifices to care for Tracy and their daughter.As we spent an entire day at the cancer center on her 10 year anniversary with Dustin and the day of Shyla's first Christmas Concert  we talked about her fears --how her treatment would impact her family  how many more things in her life she would have to miss out on  her concern that they would have to sell the house they just purchased and have spent months fixing up. Here's the thing: my friend is a very proud person--she would be the first person to give you the shirt off her back  but struggles with asking for help. At that moment  the \"best friend tough love\" kicked in and I turned to her and said that she would get through this  but would \"have to suck up her pride and accept some help\" (with some curse words added in for effect). This is where you come in. You may know Tracy. Or she may be a complete stranger. But please know that whatever you choose to invest in her--her life  her family  her home and the future of that little girl with the HUGE imagination--it's going to an incredible human being and partner  a loving mother  a dedicated sister and daughter  and the best friend anyone could ask for. From the bottom of our hearts  thank you in advance for finding room in your heart to help this family.￼"

He is a loyal friend  active in his community  always cheering on his boys in soccer and basketball  and works tirelessly fighting for the underdog as a Public Defender. Recently Olin has been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)  a disease of the motor neurons. It is a progressive  neurological disease that leads to muscle weakness  atrophy and aggressive changes throughout the body.As you know  ALS is not a good diagnosis. But  after meeting with their team  they have some things to be hopeful about. They think Olin has “slow progression” which is a huge relief. And  despite the fact that his symptoms are visible (trouble walking)  he can continue to work and participate in everyday life. He is a great candidate for a new treatment which he has already started at Mass General Hospital. This treatment has been shown to slow the progression down for most people. That said  ALS comes along with needs that are unavoidable. The out-of-pocket costs associated with this disease average upwards of $250 000. This is something most of us cannot even comprehend. Understandably  this has put a huge stress on them and their family  adding to an already stressful situation. We would like to help Olin and Christa by lessening the financial burden of this unfathomable reality. We are raising money to help with some necessary home construction projects that will allow Olin to remain at home safely and comfortably with his family. In addition  medical equipment and other items will become necessary in the future. Our goal is to give them a little peace of mind so they can spend time together without the extra stress."

For the past twenty years  as an internist at Hahnemann Hospital  Holy Redeemer Hospital  and then at Doylestown Hospital in Pennsylvania  Dr. Henrietta Friedman devoted her life to saving the lives of others. Now  she needs your help to save hers.In September 2018  Henrietta noticed that she was having trouble walking. Multiple tests revealed Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  also known as ALS  or Lou Gehrig’s Disease. After she was diagnosed  Henrietta’s condition continuously deteriorated. She is no longer able to work  given that the disease has stripped her of the ability to walk  drive  and stand upright.  You may recall the “Ice Bucket Challenge” on Facebook  where many of us dumped cold water on our heads to raise awareness about ALS. Few  however  know the symptoms of this disease which are progressive muscle weakness initially paralyzes the arms and legs  spreading to breathing muscles  leading to respiratory failure. What makes this even more tragic is that as a doctor  Henrietta holds no illusions about her condition. There is no known cure for ALS.Henrietta  however  is no stranger to struggle. She is an immigrant from Lithuania  and a single mother of two boys. When she came to this country  Henrietta took any odd job she could find  working at a gas station  nursing home  and restaurants— all while learning English  studying for the medical boards  and supporting her parents. Even after becoming a doctor in America  Henrietta’s life was not easy. She worked many night shifts at the hospital to spend the days with her two boys  and she continues to support and care for her elderly parents. Through it all  Henrietta was always full of life. She could play any melody on the piano  and she has a beautiful voice.Though her hands are too weak to play the piano now  one thing remains constant  Henrietta will not give up that easy. Through countless internet searches  phone calls  and consultations  Henrietta was able to get in touch with research teams in multiple institutions currently conducting trial  as well as highly exclusive experimental treatments on ALS patients. Some have offered Henrietta a new and promising treatment that could potentially reverse devastating degenerative effect of ALS on her muscle tissue.  With your help we will be able to support extremely demanding treatment that Henrietta needs and pave a path of hope for everyone else affected with ALS."

Please read Ellie’s story and give what you can.Two weeks ago  we were still picking out pieces of cake from the carpet after Ellie’s fifth birthday party. We were running after her as she tore down the street on her bicycle. We were watching in awe as she mastered the “big kids” monkey bars at the playground. We were cheering her on  poolside  as she trained for the Wayland Junior Warriors swim team. We were beaming with pride as she stuck up for her little sister Annie at preschool (then  recoiling a moment later  from their high-pitched screams at each other). We were “traveling to exotic lands” on an imaginary airplane she had built from cardboard. She offered us “in-flight dining”  made “hotel reservations” and even packed everyone’s bags. In retrospect  her intuition seems uncanny. A week later  she was in the hospital with cancer. On March 21  the same day we were expecting to hear great news about her acceptance to a Kindergarten Spanish Immersion Program  we got the worst news imaginable and embarked on an entirely different journey.  At her five-year wellness checkup  Ellie’s complaints of neck and arm pain  bruises on her shins  and red dots on her stomach and chest prompted her pediatrician to order blood work. The results were ominous  and follow-up tests quickly confirmed their suspicions and our worst nightmare. By the end of the day  instead of meeting with her new principal  we were meeting with a pediatric oncologist at Boston Children’s Hospital where he explained that Ellie had leukemia. That’s how fast our lives changed forever.Ellie has Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)  B Type. Untreated  it could kill her in months. ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer and  fortunately  has very good long-term prognosis (98% of children go into remission soon after treatment  and 90% of those children are cured). Ellie has started chemo. The initial treatment will last about a month and confine her to the hospital. If successful  she can go home and continue primarily as an outpatient  with full treatment lasting through several more stages of chemo for a total of 24 months.Ellie has been a trooper  “one of the bravest kids” they have seen. She hates the needles  but enjoys exploring the hospital  watching Disney videos  and getting presents. Her drug-induced mood swings are wrenching  but her voracious appetite and love of new people  places  and experiences returns quickly. She still relishes bath time (even with a PICC line in her arm)  paints her toenails sparkly purple  and fights with her sister over toys. She still likes things exactly her way and is teaching us how to live in the present - the only way we can cut through the recurring bouts of fear and helplessness that grip us.Medically  we are in the best of hands with the team at Boston Children’s. Logistically and emotionally  our extraordinary local community has carried us. And Ellie’s indomitable spirit  unquenchable joy  and contagious joie de vivre light up the room. The financial side of things  however  is unsettling and harder to know how to handle. Doctors  financial experts  and other families who have dealt with this say that  even with good insurance  we should expect out-of-pocket expenses far beyond annual deductibles and co-pays--easily many thousands of dollars over the next few years. So  while insurance should pay for Ellie to beat the leukemia  keeping the family stable financially will be much harder. We are grateful for any contribution you can make and encourage you to share Ellie’s story with others if you feel so inclined.We are slowly  painfully beginning to accept that  even when Ellie makes a full recovery  our lives won’t be the same. Yet  we remain optimistic and grateful in light of the incredible care and support we have received from so many people. If we’re lucky  maybe we’ll look back on this as the biggest (mis)adventure of our lives  an unplanned “layover” to be sure  but one that will forever remind us not to take a single moment for granted.Thank you for your love  faith  and generosity.With Deep Gratitude Leah  Doug  Ellie  and Annie￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"

We are so blessed by you all!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Post (11/20/2018)Family and friends Life can change in a minute.  Michael learned this on November 14  2018 as he was given the news that he had a large mass in his brain.  A further biopsy brought the devastating news that it was malignant  a brain cancer called Glioma.As always  Michael’s first concern was not for himself but for his wife  Lori  and their four children; Aidan (17)  and the 13 year-old triplets  Lindsay  Courtney  and Brady.  We have the opportunity to come along side this awesome family.For those of you that know Michael  you know that he has a strong Midwestern work ethic and has a pull yourself up by the boot straps mentality.  He went to the University of Michigan for undergraduate school  got a graduate degree from the University of San Diego and has had a successful career.  He is too proud to ask for help  but that’s what friends and family are for.In 2015 after working at Microsoft for 10 years and living in Seattle for 20 years  Michael and Lori decided it was time to move somewhere sunnier.  They made a short list of cities that included Orange County California.  In the summer of 2016 Michael got a new job at a start up in Newport Beach and the family moved to San Clemente.  Michael loved his time working at NextVR  but unfortunately lost his job there in February of this year.  He was able to quickly land another job a few weeks later at another start up  and while he has equity in the company  they haven’t been able to pay him a salary or provide benefits so the family has has had to live off their life savings for the last nine months.  Michael had been interviewing for a VP of Marketing position at an established local company and had to miss the final interviews on the very day that he had his brain biopsy done.  Michael wants to work and provide for his family  but now he has to face the possibility that he may not be able to after his brain surgery.  This is providing Michael with a lot of anxiety as the sole provider for a wife and four kids.  He has been in the midst of the “perfect storm” dealing with the loss of income over the last 9 months  at the same time as a devastating diagnosis.  We have the opportunity to help him find the “eye of the storm” where financial peace at least  can be found.  Asking for help  Michael said  is harder for him than the cancer itself.In the 2 ½ years they have lived in San Clemente  both Michael and Lori have become an integral part of the community.  He has generously given his time taking a leadership role in the High School Football Booster Club while Lori has blessed the teams as their photographer.  He also teaches Sunday School and he and Lori are always available to extend love and support to those in need.  In return  the community has rallied behind the family with an outpouring of love and service.  He loves deeply and is loved deeply in return by all.There is a long and difficult journey ahead for both Michael and his family.  It begins on November 27 with surgery at the UCLA Medical Center  to remove as much of the tumor as possible.  This will be followed with 6-weeks of radiation and chemotherapy.  Michael would love to share and experience this journey with his family  friends and community.  There will be good days and bad days  but they will be met with faith and determination.  He fully believes that everyone can benefit by going through this experience with him.Whether you have known Michael for 53 years or one week  his presence in your life has been a gift.  We now have the opportunity to be a blessing to him and his family by relieving the financial burden of growing and ongoing expenses in the following areas:·        Mortgage·        Insurance·        Medical Expenses·        Lost incomeOn behalf of Michael and his family  thank you for your concern and your generosity."

With this  there has also more importantly been an overwhelming amount of support  strength  and thoughtfulness. We have seen 3 people who we love and cherish have to undergo something so unimaginable  so hard and so unfair. The strength and courage that they have shown  especially our sweet  beautiful Avery (who took surgery like a champ) who is 18 months and turns 2 on May 10  has been an absolute inspiration. I know there have been some updates shared but wanted to let everyone know some background:2 months ago  Avery left Lutheran General after a three day hospital stay with a diagnosis of Acute Cerebellar Ataxia where this beautiful  sweet  independent girl stopped walking  talking  started shaking and had fast eye movements. Avery started physical therapy but nothing seemed to be working....On Monday night  11/19  Michael and Helena's parental instincts kicked in and they brought Avery to Lurie’s ER and was admitted right away. Here  we all hoped to find answers and we did. We learned that Avery has been diagnosed with Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome  an extremely rare neurological disorder (1 in 10 million) that is associated with ocular  motor  behavioral  sleep and language disturbances  which was a brutal diagnosis. Avery underwent a CT scan to rule out any tumors  but unfortunately one was found on her adrenal gland. On Wednesday  11/23  Avery had to have surgery to remove her entire adrenal gland just to be safe since the tumor was attached. Avery spent 3 nights in Luries where they found a neuroblastoma tumor that is often involved in cases like this. They performed surgery to take it out and will perform additional tests to make sure the cancer did not spread to her nervous system. Avery was absolute rockstar for the removal as well as the bone marrow tests. Avery’s parents decided to donate some of her bone marrow to researchers since her diagnosis is so rare and hope it will help get answers for her and others. As we learn more about OMS and how there are only thousands who have it in the whole world  we are especially thankful Lurie’s caught it when they did and for being truly amazing. Avery will start an aggressive treatment plan that includes IVIG Immunoglobulin therapy as well as high dose steroid shots  physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech therapy. She will likely start on the drug rituximab. She will have some hospital nights and some nights she can come home. She will have countless scans to make sure no cancer spread to her nervous system and to check in on her insides. Her parents will try to get her to the best specialist in the country since it’s all so rare too. For those of you who have asked what you can do to help  THANK YOU!!  Your prayers  thoughts  well wishes  meals  cards  calls  and texts have been so appreciated.  If you would like to make a donation  your support will help with current and pending hospital bills  coupled with future doctor visits  overnight stays  medicine and treatment  visits to OMS specialists  taking days off work & current/future research to help find a cure. I am hopeful that we can count on the support of friends  family  neighbors  coworkers  & everyone to help if you can and please  please keep Avery  Helena  and Michael in your thoughts and prayers!Thank you again for your support for the Smiths.

Robbie has been her rock and has never left her side. These funds will help cover their hospital bills  travel expenses  and anything else that might come up.  Robbie also happens to be from England.   The Deegan family has taken Robbie in as one of their own  but there's nothing like having the comfort of your family nearby when going through a time like this.  We would love to be able to raise enough money to help get his family to the USA to be here in support. There is some urgency to this request for donations.  We want to make sure Kathleen gets the best possible treatment  as quickly as possible.  Please consider helping out this family that always gives so much to others without a moment's hesitation. If you would like to help out in other ways  there is also a link to help make meals for the family through  https://mealtrain.com/rnmgr2THANK YOU  AND WE LOVE YOU KATHLEEN!!!!"

She is a lover of all things \"Shimmer and Shine\" and the color teal. The Story:On October 17  Stephen and Kristina decided to take Abby to the ER  concerned with frequent intense headaches. Upon arriving at the hospital  Abby received a CT scan that would reveal our worst nightmare; a malignant brain tumor. This was shocking to say the least. The next 24 hrs were spent getting an MRI  and preparing for brain surgery to remove this beast of a tumor. Abby's tumor was found in the cerebellum. After a 10 hr surgery   the majority of the tumor was removed  but traces too delicate to remove were left behind on the brain stem. Because of the aggressiveness of the tumor  more additional treatment will begin immediately.   Abby is currently being treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA). The road will be very long. Recovery from surgery  rehabilitation therapy (speech  physical  and occupational therapy)  and chemotherapy to attack the remaining cancer will be the start of this cancer journey. THE NEED: When considering the road ahead  gaining insight from other families who have walked this journey before  and knowing the potential of financial burdens around medical expenses  we want to do all we can to support this family.  Stephen is a contractor and will be out of work for a while and Kristina is a stay at home rockstar mom  which means income has the potential to be a real tension. This money will go to meet the most basic of needs and the largest of needs. Needs like medical bills  childcare for Charlie  hospital stays  travel for treatment  and time away from work  are just a few. Our hope is  to give Stephen and Kristina the ability to focus on treatment that will help their little fighter battle for her life  while having peace around paying for these things. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We are all #withabbyjames and this is an amazing tangible way to let her and this family know what love really looks like."

She is so full of life and sass that you only need ONE picture of her amazing and infectious smile to understand the light she brings to everyone’s life around her…. just one picture to understand why so many people just ADORE her! Sadly  this past Columbus Day weekend was a turning point for Gabby and her family. They received the most gut wrenching  world shattering  devastating news of their lives. Their baby girl  at just 4 years old  has cancer. After countless tests and 7 endless days  it was confirmed that Gabriella Grace Irene  daughter of Vito and Diane Irene  has Stage 4 Rhabdomysarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of sarcoma. Sarcoma is cancer of soft tissue (such as muscle)  connective tissue  or bone. Gabby’s specific situation happens to be in her abdomen area causing her stomach pain.  This campaign  GoFundMe for Gabby Grace  is to raise funds to help offset the costs of her long-term chemotherapy treatment course.  Gabby has always been very healthy which made this diagnosis even more shocking. Matter of fact  she had perfect school attendance last school year  not even missing one day. She started her first round of chemotherapy last week (10/16/18). Gabby’s treatment plan for Rhabdomysarcoma includes a minimum 16-22 months of chemotherapy. The costs of long term extensive medical treatment can be devastating to families. Costs include reduction of employment time  transportation to treatment  medicine  and specialty care.  There are also a variety of other expenses that really add up over time.Gabby’s parents and family are overwhelmed (to say the least) with this devastating news and what the future holds.  We (Kris and Nicole Schrodi) have set up this GoFundMe  but the money will be directly deposited into an account for them to use for Gabby’s medical care.  Anyone with children  knows the overwhelming love you feel for each child and how your heart breaks when they feel pain.

The horrible thing is we know there is a Non-FDA funded treatment for Carter’s cancer and we've actually seen it work to shrink Carters tumors.  We have just run out of money to continue the treatment.  I’m asking you PLEASE HELP SAVE MY SON.Two years ago  and just four weeks after I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer  Carter received devastating results that he was facing a fatal disease just days after his 18 birthday.  The doctors then shared with us my son has the most aggressive form of Melanoma and it had already metastasized in his body making his fight even harder.  In addition to finding out my son has stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma  we were also informed Carter has the B-RAF V600 gene mutation which means Carter's body is making a protein the Melanoma is feeding on.  This type of melanoma doesn’t have a cure at this point  & the inhibitors that are helpful for some have not worked for Carter.  We have tried every trial available at the University of Chicago  & Northwestern Hospital   as well as traveled to New York seeking advice from top melanoma doctors and had several surgeries at St. Jude’s .....nothing has killed the tumors.  The only thing that has worked is a treatment plan used by a doctor we now call our Miracle Doctor.This summer  we ran a smaller GoFundMe campaign and found “our miracle doctor.”  This doctor sent Carter’s blood to Greece for an onconomics test and the results come back with exactly what would help kill the cancer cells.  The reason the bloodwork was sent to Greece  is that they have an advanced testing technique that shows what Carter's tumors are specifically sensitive to and what he will not react to - this is where we learned that all of the chemo drugs that he tried in the past were not effective for his tumor type.  In Carter’s case  it is a combination of hypothermia  Ozone infusions  Vitamin C infusions  along with a few other special meds to target this particular type of cancer. The doctor created a specific protocol based on the blood results and started shrinking Carter’s tumors.  This campaign is urgent since Carter’s tumors are rapidly growing again.  In the few weeks since we shot this video  the tumors are getting much larger and more painful.  We need to get Carter back to his doctor NOW!  The large bump is the tumor on 12-5-18.Our #1 goal is to raise a minimum of $200 000 dollars. I can’t just sit and watch my son die  not when I know there is a treatment that will save him.  The crazy thing about this treatment plan is that it is a standard cancer-treatment for dogs  cats  and horses.  It is readily available for your pets  but not FDA approved for humans.  In Carter’s case - we KNOW this treatment works.  I sat at the clinic and watched as my son went from horrific pain to relief  after just a few sessions.  Over the course of a few weeks  his tumors literally shrunk in size and became so much less painful.  He was actually functioning again and able to finish his summer courses at college.   THIS TREATMENT WORKS FOR CARTER and we need him back in Florida ASAP!  Statistics show that if this cancer spreads to other organs  he has less than a 10% chance of surviving more than a year.We came home at the end of this summer with Carter’s tumors smaller and the hope we would find similar medical care in the Chicagoland area.  Sadly  we can’t find anyone that has the same treatment program and now the tumors are rapidly growing.  It is truly NOW or NEVER.  If you have a child  I know you couldn’t imagine having to watch them in pain  or even worse die.  Especially when you know there is something you could be doing to save them.  I hope you will donate to #teamcarter and help save my son.  Please share with everyone you know.  If everyone just gives a small amount  we can help save Carter allowing him to beat this horrific disease and hopefully one day be the Nurse Practitioner he wants to be.  Our other goal is to share our story to help others who are battling this horrific disease. https://youtu.be/62WPjbgO_fYCarter can LIVE thanks to your generosity!XOXO and appreciation beyond what words can say:Love  Amy (Carter’s mom)  Tim (Carter’s Dad) - sister Julia and brother Jarrod (who would give anything to save their brother).  #teamcarter       HOW YOU CAN HELP TODAY1. Pray ... standing in faith for Carters healing is the most powerful thing you can do! 2. Donate what you can  no amount is too small 3. Share on all social media with hashtags #teamcarter #nowornever4. Email this GoFundMe link & these steps to everyone you know5. Leverage any avenue you have to make this go viral WHERE IS YOUR MONEY GOING?Every dollar will be spent on Carter’s therapy and housing for the family while Carter is in therapy.  Since the therapy is out of state  we will need to rent an apartment for the time Carter is in therapy.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCEMetastatic Melanoma with BRAF gene mutation is an extremely aggressive and currently non-treatable disease.  The articles written about potential cures have not worked on Carter.  Now that his tumors are growing so fast  we truly need to get him back into treatment ASAP so cancer doesn’t continue to spread throughout his body. Statistics show that if this cancer spreads to other organs  he has less than a 10% chance of surviving more than a year.Conventional medicine has not worked for Carter and amazingly  he knows what will help him heal- he only needs the funds to make it happen.Video thanks to Michael Frolichstein."

The sound of his grandma singing to him  the feeling of the sun on his face  eating sweet ripe bananas  listening to his mama reading him stories  and going for daily walks in the fresh air with his daddy. Soon  a terrible disease will cause him to lose the ability to eat by mouth  to smile and to laugh  to see  to hear  and to move his little body.Our precious boy has been diagnosed with a rare terminal brain disease called Krabbe disease  a type of leukodystrophy. Krabbe is an inherited genetic disease. Children with this disease can’t create enough of a substance called galactosylceramidase  which is needed to make myelin. Myelin is the material your body uses to surround and protect nerve fibers. Without this protection  cells in the brain will die  and the nerves in the brain and other parts of the body will not work properly. There is currently no cure for Krabbe disease. Babies with this condition have a life expectancy of 13 months.This news has been unbearable and impossible to fully comprehend. That is why I now ask for your help on behalf of my sister (Lana) and brother-in-law (Dragan).Because there is no cure for Krabbe  children with the infantile onset receive only palliative care and supportive therapy. To help keep Nikola comfortable  there are therapies and special equipment to ease his pain. Most of this is not covered by health insurance and is extremely costly. Additionally  there is only one physician in the U.S. that specializes in this rare disease. Dr. Maria Escolar (Director  Program for the Study of Neurodevelopment in Rare Disorders) is located in Pittsburg  PA. Anytime Nikola must be seen by her  Nikola’s parents have to travel from Virginia to Pennsylvania at their own cost (flights  hotel  car rental  etc.).Our goal with this campaign is to help Nikola’s family obtain necessary medical equipment to ease complications and comorbidities associated with Krabbe disease. Our other mission is to bring awareness about this terrible disease. There are only 4 states in the country that test for Krabbe on the newborn screen at birth. If treated at birth  Krabbe victims can have a significantly better outcome and live a longer life. Any additional funds we raise from this campaign will be donated to Hunter’s Hope. Hunter’s Hope Foundation addresses the acute need for information and research with respect to Krabbe Disease and related Leukodystrophies. This organization is pushing for legislation for testing as it could have saved Nikola’s life and the lives of many other babies with Krabbe Leukodystrophy. For more information  please visit  https://www.huntershope.org/  Any funds that we raise for Nikola’s family will be used to purchase the following listed below:1.      Pulse-ox machine  oxygen machine and suction machine to help Nikola to avoid aspirations.

But with your help  a little boy named Will Woleben will wake up to the best Christmas present of all this year.Will was diagnosed with Leigh Syndrome at age two. Of the 22 000 genes that make up Will's genome  one crucial bit of genetic material--the SURF1 gene--is broken. Without a working copy of this gene  Will's brain cells cannot generate adequate energy to function and live. Though he appeared healthy at birth  Will's brain has been effectively starving to death on the cellular level since then.Will turns age seven on Dec. 21. He has lost many of the developmental milestones he reached as a toddler. He can no longer speak  walk  or swallow. The doctors have told Will's parents  Doug and Kasey  that he likely won't live past age ten.Worldwide  only 1 in 100 000 children like Will are born each year. Their median age of survival is 2.5 years. Because Will's disorder is so rare  his parents have become advocates and grass-roots organizers working desperately to save their son.After years of being told by doctors and drug companies all over the country that \"nothing\" can be done  Doug and Kasey now believe their family is at the epicenter of an impending medical miracle.This past year  UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) began building a premier gene therapy lab in Dallas  just 30 miles from where the Wolebens live in McKinney  TX. The hospital team is committed to researching an experimental cure for the SURF1 disorder. Eventually they hope to customize that cure for many other fatal genetic mutations. (Collectively  single-gene and mitochondrial defects affect more people than cancer.)Dr. Steven Gray (a scientist who joined the UTSW team last December) has pioneered a new technique:  using a human-safe AAV9 virus may to transport trillions of effective copies of the SURF1 gene to a patient's brain. This is done via a single spinal tap. UT Southwestern hopes to lead an FDA-approved human trial for this experimental treatment within two years  just shy of Will's ninth birthday.But the research is costly. This is why we need your help to put $3.5 million in the bank now. With the research funds secured  the UTSW team can work at top speed to meet the only timeline that can help Will. One day there will be a cure for the Surf 1 disorder  and together this Christmas Eve  we can give Will his one chance to experience that cure.All funds raised through the One Day for Will campaign will go directly to fund the SURF1 research at UT Southwestern. When you give to our Go Fund Me on Dec. 24  you'll become part of the great crowd cheering for Will in his race against time. You'll also help every child born with a single-gene mutation by advancing the science that could save them all.The one-day urgency of our Dec. 24 GoFundMe campaign is designed to mimic the urgency faced by Will  his family  and his doctors. Will you join us in giving on Christmas Eve? If so  you'll help make a Christmas miracle come true and you'll be part of breaking a heart-warming fundraising record. You'll also help us prove wrong everyone who says it can't be done!If you would like a donation amount receipt emailed to you for tax recording purposes  please provide your contact email in a private comment with your donation. Be sure to check the box under your comment that says \"Hide my comment from everyone but the organizer and team.\" You will receive an emailed receipt from the 501 (c) 3 Cure Surf1 Foundation  which is solely dedicated to raising the research funds and will receive all funds raised by the One Day for Will GoFundMe.

In May  2017 she began experiencing ulcer symptoms. After several doctors visits  she went to the local emergency room where they ran a series of tests and informed her she had Stage 4 Metastatic Gastric cancer that spread to her lymph nodes  liver  peritoneal cavity and ovaries. Joy underwent a very aggressive 3 drug chemotherapy treatment for 7 months that several oncologists she consulted with felt she would not survive. She defied all odds and came out of it like a trooper. Her cancer was controlled  and everyone began to feel hope that she was going to beat the odds. The oncologist lowered her dosage of chemo  and the cancer starting returning. He then switched her to a different two drug regimen  and that did not stop the cancer from spreading. She is now on an immunotherapy regimen that also doesn’t seem to be helping. Joy has continued working full time throughout this journey. She has not missed one day of work due to pain. No matter how she feels  she forces herself to eat three meals a day.  She always keeps her spirits high and remains optimistic about the future. She is surrounded by the most loving and supportive family a person can ask for. They all fulfill a special role in her life and provide for an unconditional love that is second to none. They ensure she remains motivated  they manage her diet  they demonstrate the love they have for her through quality time  affection and a sense of love and unity that makes them feel they can conquer all as a team. As an outsider watching in  it warms your heart to the core.   Joy spent her whole life raising and caring for her family. They all now willingly have switched roles with her. The pain level Joy is dealing with has gone from a moderate to severe on a daily basis. Based on that  her family began researching other options to help in her healing and pain management. They found a clinic called the Schachter Center for Complementary Medicine that provides a holistic and comprehensive approach to treatment combining innovative developments in alternative  integrative and complimentary medical care. This combines nutritional supplements  nutritional guidance and high dose vitamin c infusions.  The GoFundMe page  is being setup for Joy because this new treatment plan is extremely costly and not covered under medical insurance. We feel there is hope with the holistic treatment clinic and do not want to defer Joy from doing it based on it being too costly.   Jenna and Joy are the beneficiaries of these funds which will be sent directly to them  and used for Joy's treatment."

He is in multiple therapy sessions daily and is getting into his wheelchair several times a day – which is helping him get around and out of bed. He has had many of his friends visit already – which makes him happy. He will be at Shirley Ryan Ability Lab through mid-February. The Baumanns are taking each day one at a time – it is too early to gauge recovery at this point.  (It has been just four weeks since the accident so there is a lot of necessary healing of the spine and wounds before such assessments can be made.)The ordeal has brought about and will continue to bring costs above and beyond insurance coverage. (The cost of the air-lift from New Orleans to Chicago alone was over 20k.) In addition to the medical and therapeutic costs which are significant  Laura and John face daunting expenses  which include renovations to their house to make it wheelchair accessible  and a wheelchair ready vehicle. Laura has taken a partial leave from work. As time goes on  their out-of-pocket expenses will continue to be formidable.In order to make sustained care affordable  the help of the Baumann’s community of friends is critical.

It's one of the hardest things in the world for me to ask for help and I've thought about it a lot  before making the decision to do so. I walked in here with my brother  I refuse to walk out of here without him and I won't leave his side. Obviously open heart surgery is very expensive in the USA and this has been a long process  requiring several stages of treatment  often by world leading specialists.  I want my brother to be able to focus solely on his recovery  without being distracted by medical expenses  the cost of hospital stays  recovery & all the stress & financial burden that occurs when rendered with an inability to work & pay bills. The original plan was for me to continue to work & tour alone  until Allister recovers  but until my brother walks out of this hospital I won't either. This is why I've decided to reach out to our friends and ask for whatever support you may be able to offer. If you have the ability to donate I am not sure how to convey my gratitude  other than to say that it will mean more than words can express. Should you feel so kind  I'd be very grateful if you could share the link to spread the word. With all your support  positivity & love EC Twins will be back  full of energy  with huge smiles on our faces  better than ever. I love you all so much and thank you for all your support! Read on for full details on Allister's story  condition & recovery.On 6th February 2019 Allister was admitted to UCLA medical center to undergo a long & complicated open heart surgery.Allister was born with a rare & serious congenital heart defect  named \"Ebstein's Anomaly\". When Allister was a baby doctors advised our parents to anticipate raising a sick child. We were told he wouldn't be as tall as his Twin Brother Marc (if anything he is marginally taller). We were told he wouldn't be able to participate in activities with regular kids & his childhood would be extremely compromised  however he was very active  riding his bicycle every day (a thing he still does)  playing soccer   and exceeding the activity of almost all of his peers. We were told he'd need life saving surgery as a child  when that didn't happen they said \"Mid Teens at the latest\" and then that didn't happen either. He has never had the appearance of a sick person and even in to adulthood has lived an active lifestyle  that has often helped publicly mask a serious health complaint  to avoid stressing out friends and fans of EC Twins.Towards the end of Summer 2018  following an EC Twins performance  Allister went for a bike ride  during which his heart went in to an \"Atrial Flutter\"  (extremely rapid & irregular heart rate) and he had to be rescued from the side of the road.  A few days later Allister was diagnosed and booked for an \"ablation\" treatment at UCLA to rectify the issue. The ablation was successful  however the flutter was merely a symptom of the degenerative nature of his underlying heart condition and Allister was advised to undergo important open heart surgery as soon as possible.The love of Allister's life is music &  making people happy. He considers each EC Twins Supporter to be an extended family member and for that reason he chose not to share the struggle publicly  deciding that an experience with EC Twins (even through the means of social media) should ALWAYS be positive & light hearted & that the fans should be protected from certain harsh realities. He also made the brave and dangerous decision to honor every confirmed booking  refusing to cancel a single show and undergo surgery only when every date was fulfilled  unwilling to disappoint clients or fans. He performed right up until the weekend before the surgery . I  can personally assure you  that some of those performances & the travel were extremely physically challenging and scary for him. Your smiling faces & support helped him find the courage.It may be important to note that Allister lives a super healthy lifestyle. He works out every day. He's vegetarian  never touched a cigarette  a drop of alcohol  nor a single recreational drug. Though we have an arduous touring schedule and work in a high pressure industry (often with little  or no sleep) we wanted to mention that Allister's condition is a birth defect  not the result of his lifestyle. We don't want anyone out there to fear that this may happen to them. This is a very rare congenital heart disease . It is a health issue that even I (his identical twin) does not have.Apologies to all the friends whom I have not responded to and fans who have reached out with questions about when the next EC Twins performance will be. The Surgeons at UCLA did a remarkable job and by all reports the surgery was successful  but such big procedures can never be expected to go completely smoothly and (with circumstances changing by the second) I didn't want to update anyone until I was remotely clear. The reports are that Allister has made a lot of improvements recently and I feel that I can finally see some light at the end of this tunnel. As those who know us can confirm  Allister is strong and he will fight this in the same way as he has every other battle. It's going to be tough  but he's spent a lifetime beating the odds & with your support he will beat these too. Your help will play a huge role in his recovery and when you see him back on stage as an EC Twin  with a huge smile on his face  I want you to know that you played an important role in making that happen and we will never forget it. With Love EC Twins XXSpecial thanks to UCLA's doctors and nurses  especially for letting me live here for the past two weeks. Special acknowledgement to all doctors and nurses everywhere and to those of you who have dedicated your lives to a higher purpose. Watching you work and save lives 24 hours a day within the walls of this hospital has been a mind blowing experience. You are simultaneously heroes and angels  each and every one of you!"

Bryan suffers from terminal cancer  and his only hope of survival is a stem cell transplant. Bryan is not the type of guy to ask for financial help. He is “true grit” so this is very painful for him on multiple levels. They say our family are the friends we choose. Bryan is our family in so many ways. Not only is he an amazing father and grandfather  He is giving  caring  and possesses the rare character that prompted one friend to comment: “ if you were stuck in the desert at 3:00 am   Bryan is the guy you would call knowing that you could count on him to come and save you”.  He always has put himself out there for his friends  his kids  grandkids and his community. Now  he needs to count on us!Bryan was diagnosed with AML Granulocytic Sarcoma (Leukemia) in 2008. He underwent bowel surgery removing a tumor  along with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has suffered numerous side effects from those treatments. Presently he has blood cancer  “myelodysplastic syndrome” and  is in treatment at the Intermountain Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplant program. This is his only chance of survival beyond only a few years. Since April 2018 his health has declined. Because of his cancer and associated immune deficiency  he was hospitalized with Pneumonia in June  and again in September for a bowel obstruction at the site of his tumor. Since then he has been through several rounds of chemo  radiation and just completed a Bone marrow transplant on Tuesday November 13th with a life saving stem cell infusion from his (donor) son Winston. Thank God for Winston.Unfortunately just prior to his bone marrow transplant  Bryan learned from his doctors that  he also has a heart condition that may improve upon recovery.To compound an already difficult situation  and according to Bryan’s doctor in a letter dated January 26th 2018: “ It is anticipated that Mr. Morris will need an allogeneic stem cell transplant to cure him from the disease. Mr Morris will be required to remain within 30 minutes of LDS Hospital for approximately a year following the transplant for treatment  follow-up appointments and monitoring of his condition. He will need a full time caregiver and we recommend he not return to work due to the risk of infections and the immunocompromised state he will be in at that time” Bryan is 61 years of age  legal retirement age  without any prospect of having a living wage. While he continues to suffer from recovering from cancer  he has no disability insurance  but is applying for SSDI  and will hear back within the year. It still won’t be enough to  to meet his monthly living expenses. The burdens of his battles with cancer over the last decade and his divorce have left him with no financial resources to pay his medical expenses or even survive. He has no savings  he can’t spend much time around his grandkids because of his poor immune system  and his dog just died; the icing on his tragically melting cake. Bryan needs a minimum of $3800 (living expenses + health insurance premiums + out of pocket medical) per month to sustain him for the next year. This monthly amount only covers his minimum financial needs and health Insurance premiums  and DOES NOT include additional treatment: certain equipment needed for disability  possible lengthy hospital stays  medications  travel expenses (he will not be able to drive for some time) and more. Depending on how fast Bryan’s health progresses after the transplant  additional bills could add up fast.His last day of work was October 31st  2018  and for the most part has been in LDS hospital since that time. His “Cobra” Insurance that will  pay for the transplant is $1200 per month  and his insurance does not pay for all of the treatments he needs until he can meet an annual out-of-pocket cost of $4 000.Sacrificing even a little to help Bryan can provide him the much needed love  compassion  and emotional support along with the assistance  in showing him that you care.Just click the highlighted box with the words “Donate now” and 100% of your donation will be linked directly to a “Special Needs Trust” in the name of the Bryan Dinwoodey Morris Supplemental Trust with Zions Bank.

"Medical","December 3, 2018","Gino&apos;s Match Against ALS","$68,112","$75,000","388","4","382","772","GLENSIDE","PA","I write this story not only with a heavy heart  but also with hope. A year ago  Gino was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)  also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. I know the date was November 14th and if you wanted the time  down to the second  I could tell you; when life changes  time stands still and imprints itself on a heart. We sat and listened to a doctor deliver news no one wants to hear; I saw Gino  at 49  realize the weight of words. ­­The questions that ran through our heads  as we tried to process what we heard  came out as if they were one stream of (un)consciousness. The denials hit first. Couldn’t be. Are you sure? Something else  surely––something you can treat and heal? Gino’s health is his livelihood and his passion. As a tennis pro  a Marathoner––Boston six times  New York two times––and Philadelphia  Love Runs  and others in cities too numerous to remember and count––he made his strides. Before running  he was a biker; before biking  soccer owned his time. But  tennis throughout his life  defined his success. I know Gino prides himself on being a “playing tennis coach.” His years of competitive play provide perspectives and strategies that are invaluable to his students. As an athlete  he respected his body and was motivated to take care of himself. At that fateful appointment  our hands went from opened pleading to a prayerful press as we sat and listened to the doctor describe our new truths.          ALS is a hideous disease; it does not rest. It worms its way through the body in idiosyncratic and insidious ways––and this reality is different in every patient. In the year since diagnosis  its progression in Gino is sadly evident. Yet  he awakens each day feeling lucky to be able to do so. While he is still able to teach tennis some  playing days  marathons  and sports that brought him pride and joy  are over. His days are shorter  as energy is sapped  his speech is a bit slurred  and swallowing is sometimes a struggle; it was so easy to take for granted the energy he had. Now  he does what he can and we are grateful and blessed by Nassau Tennis Club in Princeton  NJ; the club owners and Gino’s colleagues have been amazingly supportive of Gino  respecting his appointments  tests  and growing fatigue. ALS survival rates vary from patient-to-patient and this reality is what perplexes doctors and researchers. While we are praying Gino is on the “20-year plan”––blessed with years similar to Dr. Stephen Hawking ––we can only hope. Our focus now is on how best to adjust our lives to ensure Gino lives happily and safely. We will need to modify our home to add a 1st floor bedroom and bathroom (both handicap accessible)  widen doorways to allow for wheelchair access  and add ramps to exterior doors  in light of the progressive state of his disease. To allow for proper transportation  a handicap accessible van  and adaptive and assistive equipment to aid in getting Gino in and out of it  as well as in and out of chairs and a bed  are necessities. Eventually  home healthcare providers will be essential so that I (Maria) can continue to work  ensuring continued medical insurance coverage. We have been advised that there is more equipment that will be vital to his care  but it is too numerous to mention. Medical bills and co-pays continue to rise and heighten and magnify the stress of the situation. With an enormous amount of humility  we have come to the point that we must ask for help.   Please know we consider ourselves the unluckiest  luckiest people in the world. This has not been our first descent into managing serious illness. Having faced and managed cancer––twice––with numerous recurrence scares and infections  we know we would never play the “Why me/us?” card. We have taken each challenge as a team  and kept the every day challenges that other working  middle-class families and parents face in perspective. We have been truly blessed and lucky to have support and prayers from amazing family members and the best  most generous network of friends anyone could wish for. This event  though  feels a little different  and while we know we will face the challenges  we know we will need more prayers and more assistance. ALS is also known as the “bankruptcy disease.” The financial challenges of caring for a loved one with ALS are astronomical  even with the best of insurance. Things we know are in our future––many of the necessities for Gino’s care––are not  and will not be  covered. Just as we were devastated by Gino’s diagnosis  we are now devastated to be seeking financial assistance like this. It is time for us to put our pride aside and ask for help. We pledge all funds raised will be separately administered in an account dedicated exclusively to care for Gino­––including  but not limited to  what we have mentioned above. If you stayed with us “this long” in reading our story  please know we finish it as we started  it is with both heavy hearts and hopeful ones that we extend thank you to each of you––for your support in friendship  for your prayers  for your guidance  and broad shoulders to help us manage the weight of this reality. We believe in the power of prayer and positivity.   Fondly  The Carosella Family"

The left foot had a little more removed than the right and below is a pic which might not be favorable to most. Jay has been recovering at HCMC since the surgery and the plan is to move him today to the nursing home for rehabilitation.  Where he'll be for another 2 -4 weeks. I posted the pic at the bottom of all of this that way you can decide to scroll down or not. *** 2-4-19 update**** Unfortunately Jay got the news today that he will be losing all his toes which includes part of the front of his feet. The road to recovery will be a lot longer. My name is John. My family is fortunate enough to be caring for Hero  Jay’s dog  during this time.The hospital has had an overwhelming request for how to help Jay and Hero.  All donations will be going towards the long recovery ahead of him. If you saw the interview (link at top)  or read the Star Tribune (link at top) write up for Jay  you'd know this will be a long recovery for Jay.  As mentioned  Jay is currently homeless.  The downward spiral for Jay began over a month ago with his wife's passing from cancer.  He is now living out of his vehicle with his best friend  Hero.Currently  it's a waiting game to see what will happen with his feet. One or both may be amputated.  Regardless  he will be in the hospital for over the next week and then followed by a nursing home to relearn to walk and have the healing process begin.  Once Jay is done with all of this  he will have an even harder road ahead of him to relearn life with Hero and the upcoming disabilities.Even though they felt it too graphic to show how frostbitten his feet got I will post the pic he sent me below. Also  below are some pics of Hero. Hero is fitting in great and enjoying his time while Jay is receiving the medical care he needs."

He can not get out of bed without help.Feb 1st had to go to St Joseph hospital for 5 days with a kidney infection. March 17th found out that pneumonia had come come back.March 26th Moved to Brookedale  skilled nursing facility in Yorba Linda.May 3rd Medicare runs out and Meeks have to pay cash for Gary's care. Currently he is full time wheel chair bound and unable to move without assistance. Costs for his care are unreal. Sit down for this. It's $550 per day for Room  Board and physical therapy ($16 500 per month) It's about $2000.00 per month to lease a wheelchair accessible vehicle that has a lift. Our goal is to raise $100 000 to help offset all of the costs affiliated with his care.  Sharon will have to start paying for Gary's care on May 3rd  2019. The goal is to raise the money for their family by May 1st. From the family: He has been fighting to survive everyday  busting his ass in therapy to regain the strength in his core and range of motion in his legs.  He is still as sharp as ever always asking how his grand kids are doing in the multitude of activities they are involved in.  Activities up until November 24th  2018 he and my mom NEVER missed.  We are praying that he will soon be able to get back to watching all the sporting events  musicals  and recitals.  It has been and will continue to be a long and agonizing process."

God knows this situation presents burdens in many forms for Brendan and the broader Maguire clan  so let's band together to offer what we can to at least reduce the financial burden.  It is a testament to Brendan's character the number of friends that he has.

For decades he has supported the indigenous cultures of the Amazon near Iquitos  been a role model of environmental stewardship  sought to preserve a legacy of ancient  knowledge  and helped to facilitate healing and transformation for people that came from all over the world to his Spirit Quest Sanctuary in the Amazon.  He is also a loving father and husband  and beloved by a world community of people that have bonded through his retreats and humanitarian work. Currently  he has a kidney donor and is coming from Peru to the United States for treatment and a possible transplant.  Either way  he is looking at a long and expensive series of treatments and recovery; however  these treatments could potentially extend his life by many years.  While he was able to obtain insurance that helps cover a lot of the treatment expenses  the remaining expenses and medications over time are beyond what he can afford.  This man has given so much aid to others and is truly deserving of our support. The amount of funds needed over time for his treatment and recovery process  potentially over several years  will be much more than the current stated goal.  We are simply stating a moderate fundraising goal to start that might inspire those that can contribute both large and small donations.

He is striving to provide care to those most in need  while bravely fighting for his own life. In 2015  three months after Bob and Michelle were married  Bob received the devastating diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Michelle and Bob  as well as our entire family  are heartbroken. ALS  also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease  is a progressive neuromuscular disease that slowly robs the body of its ability to walk  speak  swallow and breathe. The night he was diagnosed  instead of staying home scared  Bob left to go to the gym; he was not willing to let ALS get the upper hand. Bob and Michelle refuse to let this disease take away the joy in their lives. Bob is a fighter. He never gives up. Not on himself; not on his family; not on his friends; and not on those in need. We cannot give up on him either. Please help him to continue the hardest fight of his life.  As anyone who has met Bob knows that he is one of the most amazing  compassionate   hardworking  and generous people that you will ever meet. All throughout medical and graduate school he mentored anyone and everyone who reached out to him. Even now  he uses all of his energy to provide care for his patients  determined to help them through mental illness and drug addiction as long as he is able.  At the time of his diagnosis  Bob was in his 4th year of medical school and had just completed his PhD in cell biology. Rather than giving up  he continued through his 4th year rotations and fell in love with psychiatry because he feels that it allows him to make a real and lasting difference in patients’ lives. In 2016  as he began his first year as a psychiatry resident  Michelle and Bob joyfully welcomed their daughter  Hope.  At this point  the disease has taken Bob’s mobility and independence. He struggles to eat and to speak. He can no longer hold or hug his daughter; he cannot snuggle his wife in bed. Despite this  Bob recently said that the last few years of his life have been the happiest. Michelle and Bob have grown a love greater than they could ever imagine. He loves to interact with  guide and watch his daughter explore and grow. He is determined to beat this disease and be a part of Hope’s life as she grows up.It is Bob’s goal to live a long  purposeful  engaged  and full life. His commitment to his family  friends  patients  and the ALS community will not waver. Bob has taken part in numerous clinical trials all in the name of fighting ALS for himself and everyone who suffers from the horrific disease.  It has been nearly 4 years since his diagnosis; the prognosis for ALS varies widely and life expectancy can vary from less than 1 to 10 + years. No one can predict how long Bob will be able to fight  but we are hopeful that he will beat the odds.  Research on ALS continues to advance; we are hopeful that Bob can continue to fight the disease until a cure is found.  The Ross family (and extended family) is struggling to cover Bob’s medical bills. While Bob continues in his psychiatry residency  Michelle had to quit her job to manage Bob’s care and medical needs as well as support him at work. One of the hardest parts of the disease for Bob is the stress at the financial and emotional toll that it takes on the family. We have been trying to cover expenses on our own  but the expense has gotten too great. Bob’s parents have maxed out their credit cards and bank accounts. Estimates for medical costs alone range from $200 000-$300 000/year  most of which encompass ventilation  feeding tube  and in-home care and are not covered by insurance.  All proceeds are going directly to the The Robert James Ross Special Needs Trust. Trustee: Pamela Ross  Additional expenses may include an estimated:$50 000 for a specialized van$30 000 for participation in long-term clinical trials $10 000 for computer eye gaze technology allowing Bob to continue interacting with family  friends  and work.  $75 000 in medications not covered by insurance Up to $7 000 (more if his wheelchair is not compatible) for Eye Drive Technology so that Bob can drive his wheelchair using his eyesApartment renovations to increase accessibilityPlease consider donating to help Bob continue his fight against ALS and help the Ross family cover ever increasing expenses not covered by insurance. No amount is too small. Additionally  you can support the Rosses by sharing this page with your family and friends. We also ask for your positive thoughts and prayers. Thank you so much for taking the time to read about Bob and for considering donating. We are so grateful for your support in whatever way it comes."

Tim and Jean Hoefling are well-loved residents of Louisville  CO. They are faithful Christians who served many years as missionaries and have been active members in their church community. Tim has always been a hardworking family man who has hardly known a day of ill health. Recently  he began to feel low on energy and unable to recover from what he thought was the flu. However  a few days ago he was admitted to the hospital because it was discovered that he has suffered two undiagnosed heart attacks  has a blood clot near his heart  and a systemic infection that cannot be identified. As of 3/25/19 he was air lifted to Anschutz where they have determined the best course of action is a heart transplant. The Hoeflings only have a health insurance co-op plan. The doctors will not move forward with the transplant until they are sure the money will be available to pay for it. They are looking at about $800 000. This  of course  does not include all the other medical bills and their regular monthly expenses while Tim is unable to work. This need is extremely time sensitive since the medical team is working to keep him alive until the money can be secured. Please consider giving if you can. No donation is too small and no amount of prayer is too much. UPDATE: While the situation remains urgent  and the heart transplant is currently not an option  there have been many answers to prayer. Tim's blood pressure and heart rate have stabilized and he is able to have short visits with friends and family. Many  many thanks to everyone who has been praying. Your prayers are being heard!"

After first experiencing symptoms of stomach pain six months ago  Afona took all necessary precautions and went to his doctor several times seeking medical attention. Afona was misdiagnosed each time while the cancer was spreading  leading to its current devastating state. Afona Gebre is an upstanding member of our community  an incredible son  a reliable brother  an admirable cousin  and a loyal friend. He loves his community very much and we need the community to show the same love in return during his time of need. ___________It all began when Afona noticed abdominal pain about six months ago. He visited his doctor for an evaluation and was informed that the pain was due to stress at work and recommended drinking more water  eating better  and getting more rest.Afona noticed some of the pain initially subsided but after a couple months  the pain continued to worsen. He went back to his doctor for a follow up and had a blood test done for a suspected common bacteria  H. Pylori  that can cause stomach infections. The blood work came back normal; there were no signs of an infection and Afona was given a clean bill of health. A fews months later  Afona felt sharp neck and back pain so he went to see a chiropractor. The chiropractor believed a pinched nerve caused the pain so he adjusted his neck  back  and hip and Afona felt better. After a few more weeks  the abdominal pain returned and it was very severe. He took Ibuprofen and after a few hours he vomited significant amounts of blood. Afona immediately went to the emergency room and after running several tests  he was ultimately diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer. Unfortunately  most cancers do not show up in blood tests and since stomach cancer is rare for young people  the doctors never cared to screen for it. By the time Afona was diagnosed  the cancer had spread to his liver  abdominal lining  and several bones (neck  back  and hip). Surgery is not recommended as the cancer has spread to too many areas and now Afona is left to deal with the recommended radiation and chemotherapy. Also  due to the cancer spreading to his bones  Afona has suffered multiple back and neck fractures and has difficult with mobility.Aside from fighting cancer  Afona is dealing with the massive financial burden of radiation  chemotherapy  ER visits  medication  physical therapy  homecare equipment  hospital stays  and lab tests. Afona was working full-time in San Francisco  but is now on disability.To know Afona is to know a pure soul. Afona is a young and accomplished business professional  a college graduate  and involved in his Church. Afona is a genuine person that strives for great things. It’s unfortunate and shocking that this could happen to anyone  especially to someone like Afona. Anything you can do to help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance  God bless  and please keep him in your prayers!"

We thought it was a simple snowboarding injury but it was that visit  that changed our lives.After several MRI’s  the Doctors found a “bump” as we call it  in her spinal cord. This led to Olivia undergoing surgery  which lasted 14 hours  where the Neurosurgeon tried to remove as much of “the bump” as he could and biopsy it.  We knew recovery would be a long road ahead  but we were not prepared for what came from that biopsy. On March 1st 2019  Liv was diagnosed with a very aggressive grade IV Diffuse Midline Glioma. This is extremely fast growing  very rare and is inoperable; at this time  there is no known cure. The family is exploring all options including clinical trials. As a result of the surgery  Olivia lost sensation in her right arm and leg so she’s needing physical therapy to try to regain her strength and movement. To help keep Liv comfortable and to slow down “the bumps” rapid growth  she will start undergoing radiation treatments.  Those who know Olivia  her younger brother Jack  and her parents Brian & Emma  know how special this family is- they are selfless  giving  kind  hard-working and this sudden diagnosis has been devastating for the entire family.  In addition to a miracle  we need the support  prayers  and funds to help The Lipnicky Family through these rough days ahead with their daughter  our precious girl  Olivia.

You may know him as the life of the party  the loudest laugh in the room  the dorky dance move  the one who stays up too late and wakes up too early  the helping hand when you need to get out of a sticky situation. You may know him as a number of wonderful things. To his daughter  Katherine  and his wife  Robin - he is everything.  On August 28th  during a long work stint in Rwanda  John suffered a health crisis that left him with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and took away his ability to laugh  or dance  or teach. It’s been quite a journey: 4 weeks in a Rwandan ICU  trans-Atlantic air travel while only semi-conscious  2 weeks in a US ICU  4 weeks in a US acute-care rehabilitation facility. And just like John - against the odds - in the few short weeks he’s been back  he's already regained the ability to walk with assistance  to eat and drink  and to smile.  He has come so far  but there’s still a long road ahead. Our John is currently being treated at the Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS)  a multi-disciplinary facility with a ground-breaking approach to therapy. They have on-site lodging for Robin and several folks have banded together to make the adjustments so she can be in Irving as John’s Head Coach and Chief Communications Officer. We are completely confident in CNS and all the special people who work there – it is absolutely the BEST place for John to make as complete a recovery as is possible.Unfortunately  insurance only covers a little more than half the costs for long-term treatment and also involves deductibles  co-pays  out-of-pocket maximums  and procedures and medical equipment that fall outside HMO parameters… Needless to say the costs are adding up quickly.You may know John Knighten as a lot of things  but one thing almost everyone knows him for is his generosity. We are asking you to extend that generosity to his family and help us make absolutely sure he gets the best care available. Please  join us in getting back the John we all know and love!"

"Medical","December 21, 2018","Fund Ian Stevens Stage IV Lung Cancer treatment","$63,617","$100,000","606","3","599","362","LOSANGELES","CA","The headlinesHere are just a few of the things we had no idea about just three weeks ago  but sadly are all too acutely aware of right now:Ian has  Stage 4 Cancer – the really bad kind. There are drugs that can help him manage it – the really expensive kind.And that’s where you come in – the really  well  very kind kind.      The backgroundAll things considered  Ian’s 42nd birthday won’t go down as one of his best. Having been feeling unwell with bronchitis-like symptoms since September 2018  and being diagnosed with pneumonia a month later  that morning  November 28  he asked his wife  Nina  if she’d take him back to Urgent Care. The plan was simple: to get another round of antibiotics to finally knock this pneumonia on the head  so he’d be well enough to travel back to the UK for a Christmas spent with friends and family after spending the last two in their new home in LA. That was the plan. What actually happened would  in fact  turn both their lives on their head. Ian and Nina both now owe a great deal to Urgent Care’s Dr Monica Separzadeh who  after ordering another X-ray  insisted Ian go straight for a CT scan. She then called some hours later to say she’d seen a mass on Ian’s left lung and that he and Nina should go to ER immediately. Like we said earlier  this wasn’t exactly the direction Ian had seen his birthday going in...Five days later  the biopsies came back to show that Ian has Stage IV  Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. (The location of the lung tumor turned out to be in the centre of his lung  meaning it was blocking the pneumonia infection in his left lung that had been causing his symptoms all along.) A brain MRI then showed that the cancer had spread  to six tumors in his brain.The news came as a huge shock for someone as healthy and strong as Ian and they were completely floored.The causeAfter some molecular profiling of the tumor  it was discovered that Ian has a rare genetic mutation called ALK; a mutation that can cause lung cancer in non-smokers and young people and that also – because presumably it isn’t the world’s most stupid mutation already  or maybe because it’s going for some sort of special award for A**hole Mutation Of The Year or something – commonly means it spreads to the brain. Only 3% of all people diagnosed with Ian’s type of lung cancer have the mutation. The scienceThe ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) mutation is a rearrangement in a gene that codes an abnormal protein called tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes (proteins) that act as chemical messengers  sending signals to the cells’ growth centre and  in this case  dictate the growth of Cancer.The exciting thing about this discovery is that now some Cancers can be treated with drugs that block tyrosine kinase and inhibit the growth of the cancer by blocking the signals that tell the cell to divide. They essentially control the Cancer’s “on-off” switch. This is called ‘targeted therapy’ and is less destructive on healthy cells than chemotherapy. The drug Alectinib (Alecensa) has been recommended by Ian’s oncologist as an urgent first route as it has promising results in crossing the blood-brain barrier (unlike traditional lung cancer drugs) meaning Ian may not need radiation therapy on his brain. This would be the preferred route given all the potential degenerative side-effects from radio surgery.The PathIan and Nina have been seeking advice from leading experts in the UK as well as their adopted home in California. Ian is very lucky to have some of the best Doctors for his condition treating him and to live in a place at the cutting edge of lung cancer research.The moneyThis treatment is very new and is a positive step amidst a background of lung cancer treatments that haven’t increased survival significantly in the last several decades.However  it is also very expensive – $15 000 per month – and is not fully covered by insurance. This is something Ian will have to take every day for the rest of his life.The futureIan will be monitored every two weeks  with regular scans to check the progress of the tumors. Like all drugs  the cancer cells will become resistant to prolonged use. But  this is one of the most promising times in lung cancer and if and when they become resistant  Ian’s doctors are confident there will be new treatments and trials for Ian to try. The manLook  the truth is that he’s a Tottenham Hotspur fan. So it’s not like the guy is perfect. But if you know Ian  you’ll know why he’s so important. You may know him as The Steves  Eens  Cousin Ian  Uncle Ian  the Maverick  Big Bear  proud husband and Godfather.You’ll also likely know that he’d be the first person to help you if the shoe was on the other foot.If you’ve never had the pleasure to meet Ian  chances are you’ve probably loved his work over the years  given that he’s the multiple-award-winning Creative Director behind some of the most iconic magazine covers the world has ever seen  on magazines like Empire  Q  Top Gear and very many more. Today  Ian lives in Los Angeles with his loving wife Nina. He's the Patrick Star to her Spongebob and from tomorrow  with your help  he’s starting their fight back. Thank you."

Steve’s hernias (a complication from a surgery in 2003) ruptured and resulted with six perforations in his intestines. This health event led him on a surgical path to endure 9 surgeries  24 procedures and 8 rounds of antibiotics  all while also receiving dialysis for kidney failure. He defied the odds in fighting and surviving three sepsis infections. After four months of being in the ICU at NY Presbyterian Hospital  the fourth sepsis infection proved to be too much. Steve passed away peacefully while surrounded by his family in the hospital.  Stephen leaves behind the love of his life  Denise Orlando Perciballi  and their four children: Noelle (age 20)  Stephen Jr. (age 18)  Leighann (age 16)  and Joseph (age 14). I am Jennifer Perciballi  Steve’s sister  and proud Aunt to his incredible children. With the family’s permission  I have launched this page to help achieve what my brother would have continued if he had more time with us on earth.  Many kind and gracious family members  friends  former colleagues and teammates from when Steve played Division 1 soccer at Iona  and was goalie for Northport H.S. as they became N.Y. State champs  have expressed a desire to help in some way. You should feel no obligation to contribute  and do so only if it helps you feel good in honoring Steve.  Steve so desperately wants his family to remain in their home that is filled with loving memories  which sadly  they risk losing without his income. (A little backstory: With a compromised health history from earlier in his life  Steve was denied the typical safety net of Life Insurance; and with the evolution of the NYSE he  like others  had to shutter his business as a two-dollar broker in 2008  and shortly after he became disabled with Charcot.)  The Stephen Perciballi Medical & Family Fund will help provide a great measure of comfort and support to Denise  Noelle  Steve Jr.  Leighann and Joey as they move forward in life. Nothing would have made Steve feel more loved than having his family and friends realize his dream.  All the funds raised through this campaign will be used to help pay medical bills  as well as contributing to mortgage payments.  The Perciballi family would like to thank everyone for their love and support during this difficult time."

She tested positive for the BRCA 1 gene. (SIDE NOTE: If you have a family history of breast cancer  I would highly recommend you run and have this test done.) As a family  we prefer to be very private about this sort of thing. After being diagnosed and undergoing many tests  Marnie underwent an intense 20 weeks of chemo therapy.  Thankfully  she had a successful bi-lateral mastectomy this past holiday season. Prayers were answered  and both lymph nodes and pathology are clear. We are beyond grateful that she is currently cancer free. That said  this is the beginning of an ongoing journey for those that understand the BRCA1 mutation. Marnie has been unable to work since May 2018. She is a behavior therapist  specializing in working with children with autism. By the time she is able to go back to work  it will be just over a full year. These donations will pay back money that helped cover expenses incurred over the past year including lost income  her upcoming breast reconstruction surgery  travel  lodging  and other everyday living costs while she finishes the next 6 months of fighting this process. A large portion of your generous donations will be used to pay back debt that she has acquired due to loss of income. The remaining portion will be to cover specific costs associated with consultations  fertility treatments  and all out of pocket expenses which her insurance did not cover. Early on  her plan did not cover all consultations needed to get treatment started. So she had to pay out of pocket for the majority of her appointments. And as an otherwise very healthy  young woman of 32 with a committed partner; fertility was always a high priority on the list behind her cancer treatment plan. In efforts to make sure she can have a family of her own after all of this  she had to put funds into fertility testing and treatments to help give her and her partner their best chances. Looking to the past  it will help pay back a lot of this debt. But looking forward  it will help her begin her next chapter without additional financial stress.Thanks & Appreciation!"

She is currently seeing a holistic practitioner that specializes in living with cancer to ensure that her body is healthy enough to recognize her cancer and prepare her immune system to fight back. This GoFundMe was created solely to help Allie with her medical expenses and ease her through the taxing process of cancer treatment. Allie is one of the most caring  kind-hearted  and warm people I have been fortunate enough to know and now she needs the love and support of others more than ever.  Please find it in your heart to donate  any amount will be greatly appreciated by Allie  her family and her friends.

I've been recently diagnosed with \"Stage 4 Prostate Cancer\". A few moths ago I started to have a hard time walking due to soreness in my legs but I just figured that the pain will eventually go away. The pain never went away and the pain increased and spread to my lower back. Due to the severity of the pain I was going through I left work early on a Saturday night and went to Spring Valley Emergency here in Las Vegas  Nevada. Several tests were given to me by the emergency room doctors and I was eventually discharged from the hospital after nothing was found. The pain came back a day after I was discharged and the pain increased day by day. I went back to the Spring Valley Emergency a week after I was discharged complaining about the lower back pain and leg pain I was feeling. 30 minutes after checking in with the Emergency Room and having an MRI performed on my back I was admitted into the hospital after spinal legions were noticed by the emergency room doctors. I stayed in the  hospital for a week after numerous tests (daily tests) were performed with the biopsy being the final test that was performed. Radiation and Chemo Therapy are the treatments that I will start using ASAP to stop the spreading of the cancer and to hopefully put the cancer into remission. The funds raise will help me deal with the high cost medical expenses and every day expenses of taking care of my family."

Further scans and a liver biopsy revealed the cancer had spread to multiple organs.After spending his entire life surfing and building surfboards  he is not able to work or surf at this time due to chronic pain and fatigue.

She suffered 4 broken vertebrae  3 broken ribs  a compressed spinal cord  a ruptured spleen  a broken wrist  and other assorted injuries. She underwent three surgeries and spent 11 days in the ICU.  She was then transferred to the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab formerly The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago  where she has been since September 11th and is expected to remain until mid-November.  In addition to continuing to heal  she is learning wheelchair use and relearning basic skills  such as dressing  sitting up and some basic movements in and out of the chair. The reality is  Shelley is now a paraplegic and wheelchair bound indefinitely. While we are hopeful that she regains feeling and use of the lower two-thirds of her body  there is no guarantee and recovery could take years. To make her home wheelchair accessible  significant modifications are required costing in excess of $100 000.  Additionally  Shelley will need nursing support upon her return home from rehabilitation.  Both expenses are not covered by insurance.Shelley  her husband Rob and eight-year-old daughter Lexie have many challenges ahead of them.  While Shelley is extremely strong-willed and facing this with her typical determination  she needs our support both emotionally and financially.I am asking you to please contribute to a fund for Shelley and her family to help offset these unexpected expenses.  Please also share this with any friends and colleagues ……remember  but for the grace of God there go I.Thank you so much  Ellen"

She recognized these as potential stroke symptoms and somehow managed to walk herself into Winthrop’s ER where they discovered she had an aneurysm.  She underwent emergency surgery to coil it which saved her life.   Unfortunately  follow-up testing revealed yet another aneurysm  a much more complicated one that required an even more serious operation.On January 2nd  she underwent her second surgery but suffered an intraoperative bleed on the operating table as her carotid artery disintegrated.  Her surgeon quickly clipped the bleeding area and the aneurysm and again miraculously saved her life.  She was in ICU but alert and responsive. We were thankful she survived and confident that she would recover.  Unfortunately  she suffered another stroke that had slowly evolved after surgery causing her brain to swell.  They performed an emergency craniectomy to relieve the pressure and once again she defied the odds and survived. For those of you who know Christine this would come as no surprise.  She is a fighter and a survivor not to mention one of the kindest  smartest people you will ever meet.  Christine was intubated and remained so for an agonizing ten days while her family never left her bedside.  This massive stroke caused extensive damage and she was in critical condition for weeks.  She was finally stabilized enough to be sent to Rusk Institute  one of the premier stroke rehabilitative centers  to begin her long and difficult road to recovery.  After a month of intensive inpatient therapy where she worked incredibly hard to relearn everything including how to swallow  the insurance company decided she was no longer entitled to this level of care. She was transferred back to the hospital to have yet another surgery to replace the bone which had been removed to relieve the swelling.   She was then transferred to another facility which would not offer the same level of care she’d had at Rusk but where she would continue to work hard and fight to get back some movement on her paralyzed left side.  After a month  the insurance company decided she wasn’t improving fast enough and stopped paying for her care and sent her home.As if the fear of losing their mother was not enough  Lauren and Patrick now faced the reality of caring for her at home.  They rose to the challenge brilliantly and have navigated each and every obstacle with love and compassion.  Christine currently requires 24 hour help with her care and attends outpatient therapy twice a week.  She has made significant milestones and can walk short distances with the use of a quad cane.  Most recently she has seen some small movement in her left arm.  While we are excited by her progress we realize this is not enough.  Her neurosurgeon and stroke recovery team are strongly recommending she have at least 4 days of high level therapy a week and think she is  a good candidate for some of the state of the art treatments available.  Unfortunately insurance is about to run out on her current outpatient visits and all of her other care is being paid out of pocket.  Those of you that have visited her recently have seen firsthand how she has faced this overwhelming tragedy with such grace.  She is incredibly polite and caring  never a complaint and most amazing to us is how she asks about everyone else and offers encouragement to others.  Nursing was not just Christine’s profession it was her ‘calling’ and even in her dire situation she is still taking care of the rest of us.  Well Everyone’s Favorite Nurse now needs your help!!  Please consider donating to help us get her the care she needs and deserves.  We cannot let an insurance company dictate the outcome of this beautiful soul.  Together let’s get her through the next phase of her recovery.As her family we are so very thankful for the love and support that we have received during this difficult time.  There have been so many generous people that have already embraced Christine in many ways.  So much so that we have been reluctant to start this fund but we realize that it truly takes a village...Thank you for your consideration."
"Medical","March 10, 2019","Heartfelt Hope for Kim","$61,035","$75,000","494","1","501","2.4k","COLUMBIA","SC","On August 31  2018  Kim Leighton  a 41 year old mother of three suffered a massive heart attack. In the emergency room  it was decided she must have an emergency heart catheterization. It revealed she had 100% blockage in two arteries and 80% in another. This heart attack left her heart severely impaired. Kim stayed in Cardiovascular Intensive Care for 5 weeks fighting for her life. She underwent several critical procedures to stabilize her. Most of her organs were compromised due to the extent of the heart attack. Luckily her brain was not one of them. The explanation for this cardiac event in someone this young was attributed to the radiation she received while being treated for Hodgkin’s Disease when she was 21 years old (1998) and again in 2001  when she suffered a recurrence of the cancer. Sadly  these same radiation treatments had also contributed to Kim being diagnosed with breast cancer seven years ago (2012) right after the birth of her second child. The treatment for this cancer was a double mastectomy.  At this time  Kim and her husband John had a 5 year old son  Charles  and a 3 month old son  Sanders. Kim had to quit working at this time. Five days after her heart attack Kim was not responding and it was decided that her only chance was to do open heart surgery to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). A LVAD is a mechanical pump implanted in the chest and attached to the heart to take the blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body. There is a cable that exits the body to batteries which operate the pump. Did I mention that Kim and John had their third son  Will in July of 2017. At the time of her heart attack  John was left to care for three boys ages 11  6 and 14 months. He survived with the dedicated support from his mother and sister taking care of the boys at home. John and Kim's mother were her unwavering support during her 6 weeks plus stay in the hospital. After many prayers and one machine/tube after another being taken away  Kim \"graduated\" to a regular room in the Heart Hospital. Then at 6 weeks and change  Kim went home to her family. John turned \"nurse\" and learned to change the dressing on her drive line and assist with preparing for showers  since Kim cannot get the electrical drive line (cable) in contact with water. Her oldest had started middle school and the middle child was now in first grade. She reintroduced herself to the 14 month old and only wished she could lean over pick him up and give him the biggest hug; not yet. Kim now had her own nutritionist  physical therapist  pharmacists  social worker and many nurses and doctors who were members of the LVAD Clinic  where she had to visit regularly. Between Kim's discharge from the hospital in October until February she was hospitalized 4 more times for different complications of a \"sick\" heart. In January  Kim and John went to Duke Medical Center in Durham  NC  for a week to be worked up to see if she could qualify to be a candidate for a heart transplant.They were elated and most grateful to be accepted onto the heart transplant list. Originally  doctors thought she would be able to stay in Columbia with her family until a heart became available. However  in early February her doctors realized that the right side of her heart had also been severely damaged from the radiation and subsequent heart attack making the need for a heart transplant urgent. Kim was moved to Duke by ambulance on February 18  2019 to await a heart and is currently at a level three status on the transplant list. There is no way to know how long it will take to find the right heart for Kim and while she waits at Duke  her husband  John  and her three young sons  Charles  Sanders  and Will remain in Columbia  more than three hours away. Once again  John's mother is staying with the boys and between John  his sister  Liz and his mother  LeAnne  they are trying to maintain the new normal for the family in Columbia  SC.  The Leightons have been blessed to have friends who have provided an apartment in Durham so that the family may visit frequently. Thankfully  this generosity has made it possible for her mother  Sissy  to stay nearby during the week  and John comes every weekend  bringing the boys as often as possible. Kim will also be able to stay at the apartment  after the transplant while she is receiving extensive care  including weekly biopsies. Kim is receiving wonderful care at Duke and is thankful for each member of the medical team taking care of her  but the separation from her family has been very difficult for all. Kim and John  along with their family and many friends are all trying to juggle to keep things as “normal” as possible for the boys. Unfortunately  the costs associated with the extensive medical treatment Kim has received (and will continue to receive) along with expenses of travel and living away from home   are exorbitant. Their insurance plan does not cover any of the costs associated with travel and lodging expenses.   If you feel led to financially assist the Leighton family at this time  please know that all funds will go directly to medical bills and high monthly expenses  including medications that Kim will be on for the rest of her life. There is no way anyone can plan for this type of medical catastrophe. Cancer three times was nothing compared to this journey.  The Leighton family is extremely grateful for all of the kindness and generosity shown to them over the past seven months. The meals  cards  gracious gifts  visits and love mean so much to the family  and they know that they could not be on this journey without the community of love and prayers  which have sustained them. Their faith is keeping them facing forward to better days  and that too has been undergirded by so many kind people. As Kim looks toward the transplant and continued care  we ask for you to pray for God to provide the right heart in His perfect timing for Kim. She especially asks that you pray for the family of the donor heart. Having learned so much about the transplant process  she would also like to suggest that you prayerfully consider being an organ donor yourself. Proverbs 3:5  Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding."

Surgery is a go and we will move forward at 9 am on Wednesday  April 17th! We are excited and overjoyed at the same time. While meeting with Dr. Roland she shared something that we took as quite inspiring and amazing— she indicated that the scan showed “decreased size of the tumor”  how is this possible? Well  we believe that it is the power of love  our minds  and pure prayer that has given us this unbelievable news. Dr. Roland was very clear that the surgery is still extremely complex  and that all of the specialists have been discussing each step in detail for weeks. The two major components are the portal vein reconstruction and the pancreas. The portal vein is a large highway for blood in the body  typically it can be reconstructed by using other veins. Unfortunately  the portion of my portal vein encompassed with the tumor is too large so they will be using an artificial vein to replace mine. This means that my body has to accept the vein  which I am sure will happen. The pancreas is the other major issue. Right now from the scan  the tumor is around the tail of the pancreas  however  the head of the pancreas is behind the mass. They made it clear that I will lose either a major part of my pancreas or all of it  both leading to being insulin dependent. This will be something that I will have to embrace and learn about. Even with all of that info and all of the other major moving parts of the surgery  here is what I am carrying with me every day.I am ready and strong and believe in my team of doctors.I am in the best hands and have the strength of so many praying for me  thinking of us  sending strength and so much more. We are so blessed to be able to take this next  hard but life-changing step  and I know that whatever comes next will be just as it should be. So with that  I move to step 4.To prepare  I am surrounding myself with the love of my husband  friends that are in town  family that I am getting a surprise visit from  meditating  walking  working out with my hubby  and enjoying every minute. Because as I know more now than ever  this is what we have— the “now ” the present  this moment—so this is what I will do  I will embrace today. I wish for all people suffering today  from anything  that they can embrace the moments that they have and enjoy today as it is because  remember  healthy or sick  this is all we have. Together we will take today and embrace it!Wishing you all a wonderful love filled day…..make it a great one….only you are in charge!MaraUPDATE - April 12  2019  Sara Nealeigh of the Bradenton Herald has written an uplifting story about Mara. HERE .UPDATE - April 10  2019Hello  Friends of Mara - Today Mara and Keith fly to Houston. Updates will be posted here and on the \"We Love Mara\" website.From Mara:One way that I have dealt with the past 8 months of unexpected health issues is to break them down into little parts  little achievements.  It may sound strange but it (among many other things) has made this journey a little more bearable and considering I am not ending my journey anytime soon  it is how I have approached this upcoming phase  the crush it and recover phase!Last week I began to feel the unsteadiness of something big coming up. I don’t know if you have ever felt this  but it’s a constant lump in my throat  pressure in my stomach (although maybe that is from my tumor)  the shakiness of my muscles.  So I called upon my mind  as I have done so often as I learn about its power  and I prayed and meditated for strength  peace  and calm. In my meditation  I begin by surrounding myself with my grandparents and family that are not with me in the physical sense anymore  I have my sisters by my side  and my friends who are not physically nearby but whom I need  and I pictured my children and husband and family sitting with me.  Through them  I gathered strength and began to break down the next phase.1) Get to Wednesday  April 10th  get on a plane and get to Houston.2) Get through the days of tests and scans and have strength and confidence that all will be as it needs to be.3) Meet with Dr. Roland on Friday  April 12th and hear the news that will confirm that surgery will proceed.4) Prepare for surgery.Out of all of those steps  when I look at them in writing I would think that number 4 would be the hardest  but little did I know that number 1 has crushed me  made me lie awake at night  pushed me to a place where I have never been before  and not because of fear  or because I am nervous. No  just the mere act of getting on a plane to Houston means leaving my children.I never thought it would be so hard to hold my daughter and know that I will not see her for weeks  or put my boy to bed and know that I won’t be the one tucking him in at night for a while.I can do pain  real tough physical pain. I can do surgery and struggle. I can fight like hell and win….but it is this heart-wrenching love pain that is shaking me  making me tell myself to “be strong” “everything will be ok” blah blah blah ….. Here is the thing. I know that all will be what it is supposed to be and that my children will be loved  and taken care of  perhaps even spoiled (tee hee) by the grandparents  their friends and all of my dearest friends who love my children as their own  but I won’t be here. And that  I think  is the hardest part.As my day goes on I will come to find the ability to move and conquer step 1  so I can get to step 2 and so on.  Although these are the hardest days I have ever breathed  they will also make me stronger  make my relationships with my children stronger  make all of our days moving forward so cherished.So as I move to get past step one  I am already preparing myself for the other steps.  Just writing makes me feel better and I know that all will be okay. I know that I have done everything that I could have to make the next steps go as I would like them to go and to be home recovering sooner than everyone thinks. I have trained my mind daily (and often  thanks Susan!) and I am stronger for it  I have trained my body….(Thanks Key!) and I am physically stronger than I have been in years. I have taken care of my body with massage and Reiki (thanks Elizabeth and Erin at Thrive!) and I can feel all of the prayers and well wishes flooding my body and soul from around the globe. They are lifting me up and giving me more strength than I ever knew I had.So  I guess you could say that I have found peace with my journey and whatever comes next. I will miss my children and husband and family and friends more than I probably know right now  but I go with love in my heart and an anticipation of returning home ready for my new life  without this tumor  and ready for whatever life hands me next……because I am sure this is not the end of my journey….only the beginning of something more wonderful!Make it a great day  think of me and know that everything will be okay….PeaceMara\"What do you do while fighting cancer?

She gathered with her husband Keith  and their two children  Kiara and Alessandro  to face the treatment plan: shrink the large tumor encroaching on important body organs to prepare for a rigorous surgery.(In a bit of a miracle  she is a candidate for surgery. On April 17th  in one month  Mara Fulk will undergo a surgery that brings hope for a long life. A medical team will perform four surgeries to remove the large Leiomyosarcoma tumor in her abdomen which will result in the loss of over half of her stomach  a potential loss of her spleen  a portal vein restructure  and a Whipple—a remarkable partial pancreas removal that on its own is described as a tough though life-saving procedure. The surgeons say that there are some other things to do  but we'll just leave it at that.)A group of friends is asking for your donations of any amount to get through this sarcoma medical challenge. All donations are deposited directly into Mara and Keith Fulk's bank account from GoFundMe. A very helpful gift is to share this campaign on Facebook or Twitter or email the link to friends. With gratitude Team We Love Mara*This is The Fulk Family earlier this year   Kiara and Ale with mom and dad  Mara and Keith.The first two rounds of intense chemotherapy stopped the tumor from growing but did not shrink it. So Mara chose another protocol. She is receiving three rounds of a new chemo and is hoping for better results. This is a photo of Mara with one of her precious sisters.Mara is also reaching out to other medical professionals in other states for opinions. Though her husband Keith has used all of his vacation and sick time  he wants to be home with her as much as possible and accompany her on these trips.

The doctors there are struggling to diagnose her and even perforated her lung accidentally during a biopsy. They say she may have anything from cancer to tuberculosis.Emily is a U.S. citizen and needs a Medevac flight home  but the expense is impossible for her family. The funding for her medical bills is also running out. Her sister is with her  but her family is going through hell trying to bring her home for a proper diagnosis and a higher level of care.Emily is a beautiful  thoughtful  genuine soul who is always thinking of her family and others. Please help her in this crisis  and if you can't donate  please pray for her and her family.Thank you!UPDATE  2:20pm Thursday from Mary Massell:Thank you all for your love  prayers  and support! Emily and Sarah have drawn great comfort from the outpouring of love and encouragement they’ve received. Emily is in a critical state. One of her lungs has collapsed  and the doctors are still unclear as to her diagnosis. As soon as Emily is stable  her family would like to MedEvac her to the U.S. Emily’s insurance emphatically refused to cover the transport  and the American Embassy has similarly provided little support  other than to provide a list of private MedEvac services. This expense will have to come out of pocket  and will be in the 50-70K range. If you’d like to send Emily and Sarah a message directly  please email them at: bringouremilyhome@gmail.comThank you for your generosity and please continue to pray and share  share  share!UPDATE  1:48am Friday:Thank you so  so much to everyone who has been so generous in helping to bring Emily home! Emily and her family have been blown away by how big the hearts of everyone are.The financial goal has been raised to $60k in hopes that Emily's family can cover the cost of a MedEvac flight to Phoenix  Arizona. Please keep praying she can make it home!UPDATE: WE ARE ON THE HOME-STRETCH  3:50pm Thursday  March 28We are overwhelmed by the love and support Emily has received through this campaign. As of this update  we are a little over 40k. This is a miracle! We have found a wonderful MedEvac company that has worked with Emily’s complex situation. They are ready to take her  despite certain mitigating circumstances that we can’t share at present. Once we have the remaining funds  we’ll be able to bring her home. From the bottom of our hearts  thank you for your prayers and support. There was a period of time last week when we thought Emily was fighting her final battle  and it was the tremendous outpouring of love that gave her the strength to keep fighting. God bless!UPDATE: Emily will come home on Saturday! 11:55am Wednesday  April 3We have reached the amount needed to pay for Emily's medical escort home!! Emily's MedEvac is scheduled for this Saturday  and the $60k will pay for that flight.Her family is in disbelief about how generous everyone has been  and they thank each one of you from the bottom of their hearts.Two weeks ago  I was expecting a call any minute telling me Emily's final battle was over. We thought it would be impossible to cobble together the funds to bring her home in time  but by the grace of God she has been able to hang on!The only remaining obstacle (and you can't make this stuff up) is that debris from an avalanche has temporarily blocked the road from the airport to where Emily is staying  so please pray that it will be cleared in time for her transport.Emily's older sister  Mary  has asked me to share this prayer for her safe transport home.Dear Saint Bernadette  Chosen by Almighty God as a channel of His Graces and Blessings  and through your humble obedience to the requests of Our Blessed Mother  Mary  you gained for us the Miraculous waters of Spiritual and physical healing.

Chris has reached a point where his heath is worsening rapidly  and he needs our help. As personal bills and medical costs continue to take a toll and he is no longer able to work as he used to  Chris’s burden will only increase. Please donate to help Chris as he continues his fight with ALS!Kenta and the Bar Goto Team********************Please check this out too: https://www.facebook.com/NowThisDaily/videos/842434226106946/ http://www.grubstreet.com/2019/03/bar-goto-gofundme-christopher-reed.html********************Some words from Chris:My name is Christopher Reed and I'm a chatterbox by nature  so let me make this as short and sweet as possible. I'm lucky  blessed and proud to be a bartender at Bar Goto in New York City.In the beginning of May 2018  I was diagnosed with a motor neuron condition called ALS.  I walk and talk like I'm drunk (but I'm not unfortunately)  I wear leg braces and I walk with a cane.  My doctors told me that I'll likely be in a wheelchair by May 2019 and that my overall life expectancy is estimated at three years. Along with my wheelchair  I  have a feeding tube and ventilator to help me eat and breathe to look forward to  and then game over.  OK. Not great  but you have to play the hand dealt to you. I'm a fighter and I'm going down swinging  but swinging costs a lot of money and that's where I need your help.As it turns out  western medicine unfortunately has had very little to offer me. I've had very bad reactions to the two drugs that my doctors and I decided to try; they made me feel much worse  which was both terrifying and heartbreaking. If I wait for western medicine to find a \"REAL\" treatment  let alone a cure  I'm a dead man.What does works for me are things like B-12 shots twice a week and a variety of supplements that help my cells generate energy. I found these things partly through my doctors and partly through researching what other people living with ALS have done to live 7-8-9-10-12 years. What's funny/tragic is that the \"out of the box\" things that make me feel solid aren't covered by insurance.  So  I'm taking a serious financial pounding. Additionally  while I am still functional  I do need to work less  and I can't afford to do it without you. I will also unfortunately reach a point  and there’s no predicting how soon  at which I will no longer be able to work at all.The saying  \"When life gives you lemons  make lemonade \" is for normal people. \"When life gives you a turd sandwich  make THAT into lemonade!\" is for people living with ALS. I believe in staying positive and truly \"laughter IS the best medicine\".  So  this is my plan:  I'm going to continue slinging cocktails at Bar Goto with Kenta and the gang for as long as I am able to.  I'm going to enjoy my time with my wife  our 4 cats (yes  4  stop judging)  family and friends.  I don't plan on dying  I plan on turning this sandwich into delicious lemonade and maybe helping find a cure along the way.I need your help and support. To everyone who reads this and to everyone who donates  thank you from the bottom of my heart  you cannot know how much it means to me. It means literally  another day lived better.Your friend Christopher Reed"

With my mother's passing  he must move to a memory care unit.There is a saying  \"How do you make God laugh?\"\"Tell him your plans.\"For many years  my mother and Gahan and I had  joked about what to do when they got older. Living on a ranch was the solution we all came up with. Back then  it was more a joke  since they were not of that age yet  but in the past year  I decided to get a ranch and make it happen. My wife and I found a ranch in New Mexico. We were to all move there at the end of March  2019. We had selected a ranch with lots of acres   a beautiful home and a casita \"guest house\". The plan was to have my mother and Gahan get set up at an assisted living facility and  spend some time there and the rest with us at the ranch.  We are still going to the ranch  where we will spread my mother's ashes. Gahan will be in our care at the casita  and we will also find him a memory care unit in Santa Fe since he also needs daily medical care. Memory care is wildly expensive. More so than assisted living. If we could cover the cost ourselves  we would. We can't  and Gahan and my mother did not save for anything like this. We are asking his fans to help us  help Gahan.That's what this is all about. Making the rest of Gahan's days as wonderful as they can be.I know this is a sad story  but it is only the end of the story that is sad. My mother lived a wonderful  full  life.

Initially my ambitious goal was $20 000 but we have surpassed our goal twice in 10 days. The true goal of this is to support my parents as much as possible. Despite surpassing the original goal  this page will continue to remain open for contribution. Thank you so much for your kindness and generosity. We are getting our hopes back again. Happy New Year!￼My parents are fighting stage 4 cancer together.   https://patch.com/new-jersey/westfield/westfield-couple-lost-business-home-both-battle-cancerMy parents and I were all diagnosed with cancer in 2013.  We found out that my mom and I had BRCA genes. I was the first to be diagnosed while raising 2 years old twins and going through a divorce. During that time my parents were supporting us financially and emotionallly. ￼￼￼My mom complained of chest pains after my diagnosis and we thought that she was experiencing heartache for all the things that I was going through.  We found out soon after that her breast cancer had returned from year 2000.  ￼￼￼Couple of months later when my dad was diagnosed with thymus cancer... we thought it could not get any worse and we fought it together. Next few years were very hard.  We were living in a same house with two toddlers and three cancer patients.  We had to work together to manage our schedules for countless surgeries  chemotherapy  and radiations. After almost 3 years of chemotherapy and I am cancer free.  ￼￼￼￼￼￼Unfortunately  my parents’ cancer came back. My mom’s breast cancer had spread to 7 different tumors and her liver.  Her oral pain medication is no longer working. My dad’s cancer had spread to his spine  pelvis and legs.  ￼￼￼My parents were hard workers. They owned dry cleaners in Westfield for 25 years.   I grew up watching parents help others in need. My mom volunteered to record college textbooks for blinds  helping disabled  and homeless.  I could not understand why people like my parents were suffering from such a horrible disease.  Now they are truly fighting for their lives.  Till now we were just fighting to be cancer free    We believed that our lives were never in jeopardy till now.  They are more worried about my kids’ future than themselves right now. Just like how all the parents are in this world. They were driving each other to treatments to Hackensack hospital before but now it has become too difficult for them to drive and takes Uber most of the time. It tortures me to watch them struggle when I cant do anything for them.     ￼￼￼     Because our cancer we lost our house and 25 years old business in Westfield. I am asking for help so that they can concentrate on their treatments. Thank you."

They were married in 2013 after a whirlwind romance. Their great love grew even stronger in 2014 when their son  Rowdy  was born and again in 2016 with a daughter  Summer Jo. In 2017  they moved to Florida and found their new home sweet home.Caleb and Kristen are an exceedingly talented couple. There isn’t anything they set their hands to that doesn’t turn to beauty. While Caleb’s strengths are surely in craftsmanship  he left his job in construction to pursue his ultimate dream: music. He learned how to play violin at a young age  alongside his twin brother Daniel  and ever since there was a tune in his heart that he so desperately wanted to share. After many months of searching for the best spot to base their family and his new career  Caleb and Kristen found their perfect fit in Tarpon Springs  FL in 2017. Since then  Caleb has financially supported his family with Cal Morris Music and developed a devoted following in Tarpon Springs and beyond.Caleb’s Diagnosis:On the cusp of a busy music season  Caleb thought it best to go checked out by the doctor on his day off. He was experiencing some out of the ordinary stomach symptoms and wanted to be healthy for the long weeks ahead. The doctor’s office ran routine blood-work  and the results came back as abnormal. Their doctor sent them to the ER  and within hours they were admitted with a prognosis of “you should probably prepare for the worst.” Caleb and Kristen spent the next four days in the hospital meeting with specialists and running tests. On Friday  November 16th they were given the diagnosis their hearts most feared: it was cancer. Not leukemia as they initially thought  but a rare form of blood cancer known as MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes).This week  Caleb and Kristen will meet with a team of oncologists to decide on the way forward. He will likely require a bone marrow transplant  chemotherapy and a host of other treatments. He will be placed in periods of isolation  time away from his children  his family and friends  and his work. The hardship to their family  financially  emotionally  and spiritually will be immense.Your Contribution:If you know Caleb and Kristen  you know they’ve experienced more personal heartbreak than most their age. Nonetheless  they’ve stood firm  with unfailing faith in their Lord  in the midst of overwhelming personal loss. Not only are they some of the strongest people out there  but they are also some of the most generous. As a recipient of their care for so many years  we’re here to support them in return  to fight this battle with them  and to remind them that no matter what may come  they will not walk this road alone. We believe they will weather this storm  that they will be sustained and carried by others  and that Caleb will walk away from this wholly healed.Your financial support will release Kristen to care for Caleb full time and for Caleb to focus on fighting the battle ahead. Your contributions will also provide the essential needs their family requires to put a roof over their head  pay for health premiums  and cover day to day living expenses.If you are unable to contribute financially  we’re grateful you’ve been able to read a small part of their story. We  along with Caleb and Kristen  pray it would point you to a God who saves and sustains in the midst of the hardships of life."

He was rushed to the hospital where a mass was discovered on his brain. After multiple tests and weeks of waiting for answers  Kraig was diagnosed with Stage 3 anaplastic astrocytoma  a rare form of brain cancer.  The tumor is similar to a glioblastoma  resulting in the need for aggressive treatment.  A second tumor was discovered in an area that is not surgically accessible.On November 1  Kraig underwent an awake craniotomy where about 60% of the tumor was removed (the size of a small hockey puck).  The first round of treatment consists of chemo daily and radiation Monday through Friday to attack what remains; treatment began December 3rd and will last for six weeks. After that  he will have a four-week break and then start chemo again along with another possible form of treatment (he can only have one series of radiation).  You can learn more about Kraig’s diagnosis and treatment on Caring Bridge.In addition to the diagnosis of an aggressive form of brain cancer  Kraig is no longer able to work as a self-employed carpenter. His history of seizures does not permit him to drive  operate machinery  or be on a ladder or roof. He also has a 10-pound lifting restriction at this time. On November 28  Kraig suffered a grand mal seizure and was re-hospitalized through Dec. 1. Until his seizures are under control  he will not be able to be left alone. Sandy has been at home caring for and driving Kraig to his appointments  navigating the medical and insurance world  preparing legal documents with lawyers and government agencies  and getting their family home of 16½ years ready to be put on the market. Kraig has been self-employed for 28 years  never taking a sick day or missing work unless it was a planned family vacation. He has worked his whole life in extreme weather conditions. In other words  he is a hard worker  and not the type to ask others for help. Kraig and Sandy are the ones who would do anything and everything to help their friends  family  and even strangers. They have dragged their feet from the start to launch this GFM page  but the reality of their medical costs and monthly living expenses is starting to add up  and new deductibles begin again in a month.Consider giving a gift this season that will help alleviate some of the stress caused by this cancer.  This is a gift that is needed  will be used  and the receivers will be forever grateful.  It is a gift that has meaning  and a direct correlation to why we celebrate the birth of Jesus  and all that He stands for. This page has been set up by the friends and family of Kraig and Sandy because many of you have expressed a desire to help.  Funds collected through this platform will go directly to pay Kraig's medical bills and monthly living expenses. If you know of others who know them and can contribute to this cause  please reach out to them.The McKown family would like to thank everyone for their prayers  love and support as they navigate the waters of this journey."

They are fighting the unimaginable right now  and need not only all of the prayers they can get  but also there is a financial need that grows every day. The family traveled to Utah to celebrate Christmas with extended family. On December 22  2018 Perryn (8 years old)  was taken to the hospital with a bad headache. It was determined that he had a brain tumor. One day later he had a 7 hour surgery to remove the tumor.Although they were able to remove the tumor  he still has a long road ahead of him to include several months of radiation and chemotherapy either in Utah or  at Duke Hospital. The particular type of cancer that Perryn has is called Glioblastoma  level  4. It is a very aggressive disease in children. The family remains in Utah at this time. They are living at the hospital currently  and have no definite date they will be able to travel back to NC.  They are still undecided on staying in Utah for treatment or coming back to NC. If they do come back they will go directly to Duke for his treatment. . This family has already been through so much this year. They lost their home during Hurricane Florence. They have not been able to return to their home  and have been staying with family. There is still no definite date they will be able to move home. As you can imagine  the costs are starting to add up. They still have to come up with travel expenses to get home. Not to mention  their portion of the medical bills. Perryn's Dad  Jake  is a veteran Marine Raider currently retired on disability and working on his MBA from George Washington University. His mother  Jaimee is a Special Needs Registrar with K12  Obviously both parents are going to be on extended leave from their jobs while they take care of Perryn. Neither one will have enough leave to cover them during this difficult time. Any amount that you can donate will help this family. Their sweet boy  Perryn is fighting for his life. He is a smart boy with an amazing personality. He is loved by everyone. He is also a warrior and is putting up the good fight. Even during all of this time in the hospital  he has been more worried about his family than himself. Please consider helping this sweet family while they go through this difficult time. If you cannot donate financially  please pray for all of them."

We have already hit our goal  but in the first two days of being in California we have incurred unexpected medical expenses. Any donations above the goal can still be withdrawn to use for Jill’s care and are greatly appreciated. As many of you know  Jill has been in an ongoing battle with a very aggressive and unusual form of cancer. She was diagnosed in April and has been going through chemotherapy ever since. The results of the chemotherapy have not been as successful as we had hoped. We took a trip to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota last week. Unfortunately  they did not have any new treatments to suggest. We have now been referred to Dr. Sant P. Chawla at the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica  California. He is quite hopeful and positive that he can help and would like us to take Jill to California for 6 weeks of treatment starting October 24th. We are excited and hopeful for this opportunity and are busy working out the details. We are looking for assistance to help pay for expenses during that 6 week period for Jill and her family (flights  airbnb  daily living expense etc.) Anyone who knows Jill knows how hard it is for her to ask for help - she takes pride in being the helper. But we know this is going to be difficult and want to take care of all the details so she can focus on her health. We know we have a great circle of friends  family  and community  and have felt the love and support quite deeply during the last 6 months. We continue to be so very grateful. Any extra money raised will be donated to the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance to help further research efforts on these tough types of cancer.I am Jill's daughter and I will be withdrawing the funds before we leave (Monday/Tuesday October 22/23) to a new bank account we set up specifically for Jill to use on the trip."
"Medical","February 25, 2019","Save The Life of Someone Changing Lives","$58,415","$53,288","529","1","538","1.7k","BROOKLYN","NY","Save The Life of Someone Changing LivesMy best friend and partner  Scott  is currently facing cancer—squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We’re determined to come out the other side of this happy  healthy  and better for the experience—but we can’t do it without your help. With your financial support  Scott stands a chance of completing a new cutting-edge treatment plan and restoring his health before the cancer advances to Stage 4. Catching the cancer when we did gave him a rare window of opportunity  and we didn’t want to waste it. It was urgent we took action  and so we did—without having any idea where the money would come from.After excessive research  multiple consultations  and thorough testing  we came to the difficult decision that the most common treatment plan presented to us is not a good fit for Scott because the sacrifice is too great. Conventional therapy dictates seven weeks of daily radiation of the head  mouth  and neck as the primary recommended treatment  but all oncologists agree: radiation of the head and neck is the most detrimental form of radiation there is. The side effects are severe; when you radiate the head and neck  you risk no longer being able to speak  losing your ability to swallow/eat properly and produce saliva  losing your teeth  losing your sense of taste  permanent thyroid damage  secondary cancer in the brain  the list goes on and on. Some patients who have survived this type of radiation say their quality of life is so severely diminished that they wish they’d chosen death instead of the treatment.Not to mention: Scott’s livelihood depends on his voice. He’s a beloved teacher and theatre professional  who has changed countless lives for the better  in classrooms from coast to coast and on some of the best stages in the country—from The Folger Theatre to The Oregon Shakespeare Festival. We don’t want cancer to rob him of his livelihood  his gift  or his greatest passion in life. So  we’ve decided to be brave and choose the treatment plan that boasts the most scientifically supported statistical success without the horrific side effects. We feel in our hearts that this treatment plan is right. We have already taken the leap and traveled across the country to the cancer clinic of our choice to begin treatment ASAP. Scott’s treatment plan includes this: *Low-dose Non-Toxic-Potentiated Chemotherapy (LDIPT)  which studies show has a remarkable 30x greater survival statistic when compared to the published dismal 2.1% survival rate of conventional full-dose chemotherapy  for 5 years in adult cancers of all kinds.*5 daily IVs  5 days each week: Vitamin C  Hydrogen Peroxide  Glutathione  POLYMVA  5-FU  plus the two chemotherapies (CisPlatinum and FIP).*Plus a long list of prescribed supplements and medications. Scott is not used to being helped or even comfortable being helped. Ever since he was ten years old caring for his younger siblings  he’s always been the one who helps everyone else. I’ve seen him literally give the coat off his back to someone else. He’s the most giving person I know. So  when I insisted on setting up this GoFundMe for him  I couldn’t help but reflect on the poetry of it: he knows how to give and give and give  even when he has nothing left to give—but the lesson he needs to learn right now is how to receive. Scott is a father of two—something he considers his crowning achievement—but he’s truly parented so many more. In the twelve years I’ve loved Scott  I cannot count the number of times a student has gushed to me in these words: “Scott changed my life.” That’s just the kind of teacher he is—the kind that leaves an impact so profound  your very identity is transformed. In the classroom  he teaches so much more than how to be an actor or how to make plays. He teaches people how to love each other  love themselves  and live their lives in a way that supports the world’s Highest Good. He is the teacher this world needs.The goal with this GoFundMe campaign is to help pay for medical bills for Scott’s treatment plan and provide financial support for Scott during this difficult time so he can direct all his focus to healing. The bare minimum amount of money we need for his treatment is $33 288. This includes $15 000 for 15 days of IVs  $3 308 for bloodwork and other tests  $2 812 for the PICC Line so doctors have quicker access to Scott’s vein for his 5+ IVs per day  $9 036 for the IPT chemotherapy drug  $1500 for the oral chemotherapy drug  and $1632 for three months worth of supplements. This does not include travel or lodging expenses for the 3 weeks at the cancer clinic. Scott’s insurance  Kaiser Permanente  will not cover any treatment other than radiation. In addition to the cost of treatment this next year  it would be great to recoup some or all of the money Scott has already spent. Scott has already spent more than $20 000 by simply consulting different oncologists  getting diagnostic testing  incorporating lifestyle changes  and incurring debt to start some of these therapies already. Needless to say: he has drained his savings. In this time  he didn’t take any extra time off from his job to heal—he has still been working 12 hour days every day since his diagnosis. Adding what Scott has already spent to what this treatment will cost  our [current] maximum goal is $53 288. If we happen to raise even more than that  Scott plans to donate it—the cancer clinic where he is getting treatment has a foundation to provide financial assistance to cancer patients who can’t afford the protocol (like Scott). That being said  we’re setting the GoFundMe at the minimum goal because the need for that is dire.From the bottom of our hearts  thank you for any size donation you can manage. Every cent counts. Every prayer lands. And as Scott’s self-proclaimed number one fan  I can’t help but weep with appreciation for every single gesture of kindness—because I want this beautiful person to be in my life for as long as possible… as I know so many others who love him do  too.Thank you for showing us the human spirit at its very best. We love you so much. Love Desirée"

If you know Peggy  you know she has a giant heart for people. I have been married to her for nearly 10 years and I have seen her give of herself over and over again. She is the first to consider others feelings and do whatever it takes to serve them. She is to me  the very definition of a christian  and has been an inspiration to me our entire marriage. She has raised our four children with grace and love through trials of all kinds. She faithfully homeschools our children all while helping run our family business. She really is a remarkable person. Which is what makes this next part so difficult.   This last month she was diagnosed with advanced inflammatory breast cancer  it is the most aggressive form of breast cancer known to date and it is going to require radical treatment options if we are able to save her life. There really are no good options and the prognosis is grim no matter how you slice it. There is hope in the treatment we are raising funding for  and without it there are no good options. We are stage 3c with the possibility of stage 4. She has a t4 (the largest tumor classification). We believe God is going to act - and this campaign is an endeavor for us to humble ourselves and seek help to save our precious Peggy. We have our entire life walked by faith and seen God do the impossible over and over again. We are believing he will show up again and heal our Peggy. We are going to work hard towards treatment and believe the best and look forward to the good that we believe he is working for us.   We are leaving this week for a variety of treatments that have shown promising results; however  our insurance does not cover them  so we are asking your help in funding.  If you're not in a position to give  we would greatly appreciate your prayers for a full healing as we truly believe this is something we will overcome. #Praying4Peggy￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"

I feel it is part of my duty as an aunt to be the second-best thing to Ainsley from mom and dad. With that being said; I need your help to raise money for my 4-year-old niece.July of 2014  Ainsley was born and boy I was a proud aunt  she was beautiful. Ainsley has had complications since day one. During birth  Ainsley suffered from a massive stroke that affected her entire left hemisphere and brain stem  which has caused half of her brain to not function properly  she was having seizures which made her stop breathing. We were told she would never walk or talk. Talk about a lot to swallow. My heart broke  our hearts broke.... It was painful to hear that about my niece. Ainsley came out to be a fighter and that she is  she has already proven that the impossible is possible. At 4 hours old she was diagnosed with Epilepsy and 10 months old she was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy.Fast forward 4 years  we are battling a new hurdle. The last 18 months  Ainsley has had increased falls- resulting in minor scrapes and bruises  excessive crying  extreme anxiety  complaining of her tummy hurting  lasting for seconds at a time  jerking and crying in her sleep. About three months ago  my sister in law  Brooke called Ainsley’s Neurologist and spoke with the nurse and asked to please help us figure this out. Of course  the doctors just want to increase her medicine  but my brother  Clinton and Brooke stood firm. By this time  Ainsley couldn’t even take 3 steps without falling. Her entire body would just give out on her and then she’d need help getting up.  She was to the point to where she didn’t even want to try to walk. After  standing firm on not increasing her medication until we got some answers  they finally scheduled Ainsley to have a 72-hour EEG in the hospital in Nashville.  After just 18 hours of testing  the Neurologist came in the room and said that Ainsley's EEG was extremely abnormal and that she has Lennox Gastaut Syndrome.LGS is a very rare form of Epilepsy  resulting into learning disabilities and uncontrolled seizures.  Finally getting answers as to why she has been falling \"drop seizures\"  all the tummy pain  all the jerks at night..... but NOT what we wanted to hear.  After learning what the heck LGS is  treatment is difficult  because the seizures often do not respond to seizure medications  also known as anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). The intellectual changes do not respond to any currently available medicine or treatment either. As a family  we were floored and not sure what to think. Still having questions... but getting no- where with the doctors/nurses in TN. My brother and my sister in law have researched hours upon hours to find answers or to find a doctor that specializes in that syndrome to get a second opinion.... Clinton finally found a Doctor at NYU that specializes in LGS.  After days of planning with the New York Doctors  NY hospital  Ainsley got scheduled for October 30th to meet with the specialists. So  they packed their bags and made their way to NYU to check Ainsley into the children’s hospital in the level 4 Epileptic center  for testing for 10 days. Long story short  she does not have LGS  thank goodness but they did diagnose her with “Focal Seizures” which are just as hard to treat. In conjunction  Ainsley has a large cyst on the damaged side of her brain that is over taking the non functioning portion of her brain. Ainsley’s left side  the side that suffered the stroke  has constant activity which interferes with her daily life- while asleep or awake. Even when she is not having a seizure. Currently  it is starting to affect the healthy side of her brain.Doctors believe that by preforming a Hemispherectomy to remove the non functioning portion of her brain and removing the cyst that will decrease the amount of seizures  medication and try to keep the functioning part of her brain healthy which is great news but that surgery comes with a hefty bill that my brother and sister in law were not expecting.I know most think  does she not have insurance? Yes  she does  but unfortunately  her insurance is through the state of Tennessee and it does not travel to different states. The doctor bills are coming in from the first time they were in NY and they are not cheap.They leave this week to head back up to New York  so they can start getting Ainsley ready for surgery and they will be there for a while. We believe  no  WE KNOW this will help the 10 year old  the 21 year old  the 40 year old Ainsley and your help/prayers are needed. We do know this is in God’s hands and He will see her through this!Any and all donations for this cause will help with all doctor bills"

Both Matt and Andrea are allowed to take up to 12 weeks of time off of work  but unfortunately because they are caring for a child  this time away from work will be unpaid.  While they are away from work  Andrea and Matt will still be responsible for their health  life  and dental insurance premiums  along with the payment of their other benefits.  Along with their normal living expenses  they will have increased out-of-pocket healthcare costs  expenses for travel  and other miscellaneous expenses that will occur during Megan’s treatment and hospitalization. Andrea and Matt have indeed touched so many peoples’ lives throughout the years and now we have the opportunity to give back to them.  Due to the many people who have reached out wanting to offer support  a GoFundMe account has been set up to help reduce the financial burden that comes with helping Megan fight Cancer.  Anything that you are able to give will reduce the financial stress that comes with this devastating diagnosis and will allow them to continue to focus on fighting this fight to get Megan healthy.  Thank you for your care  concern and generosity."

Rachel “Rocky” TaylorMy sister  Rachel  is a uniquely bright light in this world.  Her joy  courage and inquisitive spirit have taken her around the world as a disaster relief volunteer  dancer and lover of life.  She has a huge heart and spirit for service that draws her to help people in need. Over the last 12 years  she has spent more than 5 000 hours volunteering around the globe: Ecuador  Madagascar  the Philippines  China  Peru  Puerto Rico and all over the US.  She loves to dance blues and salsa  laugh with her friends and swim every day of the summer. I’ve always seen her as a bird  wild and free--the most vibrant of spirits. Ready for a full day volunteering with All Hands and HeartsWhat HappenedOn September 13  2018  while helping the people of Lombok  Indonesia recover from a major earthquake  Rachel was in a terrible accident that will affect her for the rest of her life.   Her All Hands and Hearts team was performing demolition on a house when part of the concrete building unexpectedly collapsed  leaving her trapped. She suffered a skull fracture  scapula fracture and severe trauma to her left leg. The entire team was quick to get her free and to the local hospital. After an initial life saving surgery  she was emergency evacuated to Singapore. Tragically  after two weeks of surgeries it was clear that the damage she sustained was irreparable and her left leg was amputated below the knee. The month she spent at the hospital in Singapore was the hardest time she’s faced in her life. Transition back to the States has also come with it’s own set of challenges. Her Medicaid insurance has been difficult  but finally allowed her to get the continuing care she needs at Harborview Hospital in Seattle. In the days and weeks after the accident it became clear how many lives she has touched as support flooded in from around the globe  and her community wrestled with heartbreak and relief that her spark is still with us.  Moving ForwardRachel is thirty-three years old and bravely facing what a completely new life might look like.  It’s been a long  hard road so far  and truly we are only at the beginning. There have been many unexpected expenses and we anticipate that to continue for the foreseeable future.  Furthermore  Rachel has not been found eligible for disability or unemployment benefits  and does not have disability insurance.  She’s also indefinitely unable to return to her work as a stagehand.  Her last surgery was mid-November  in the next couple of months she will be fit with a temporary prosthetic  and over the next year and a half she will continue recovering and adapting. Due to the complicated nature of the injury there are challenging unknowns regarding her future mobility limitations.  Seeing her struggling to get out of bed after five weeks in the hospital and vulnerably facing an unknown future hurts my heart.  At the same time  while there are still moments of grief and struggle  I am inspired by the strength with which she is embracing life and dreaming of a bright future. Where You Come InI want Rachel to know the same love and support that she has shown others all her life while she faces this year of recovery.  I want to see her thrive as the fiery  sassy  big-hearted dreamer that so many love  and I need all of you to partner with me in this difficult time and ensure she is able to live a full life: a life of joy and purpose  of dancing  swimming  laughing  traveling and serving others as before.  Please consider generously supporting us and spreading her story. We are hoping to raise enough money to take care of her needs for one year. The money will be used towards:Housing: $14 000Food: $3 600Utilities: $1 800Counseling: $5 200Transportation: $7 000Reliable automatic vehicle/vehicle modification: $7 000Job retraining: $10 000Additional medical expenses: $10 000Prosthetics $5 000 to $50 000 Travel medical expenses: $1 750Prosthetics over the course of a lifetime: $375 000If you can't help financially  there are several other ways you can help.

However  it has been challenging for us to keep up with the amount of texts  calls  etc.  That's why we decided to set up this CaringBridge. Time is so precious.  We want to take advantage of quality family time to make the most of each and every day.   Martin  Sean  Colleen  and Connor are all very active in their busy lives and we are usually on the go.  That has been our life  we wouldn't have it any other way  and we hope to keep it that way... as normal as possible.   Juggling six schedules  meals are often on the run.   We also have picky eaters (including mom and dad) and that's why meals are not needed at this time.  Thank you.The main thing requested right now  is PRAYERS. We believe in the power of prayer  and we need them now  more than ever before.  The Meenan and Kean families are both deeply rooted in  their strong faith.   As one of our favorite prayers states  \"When you see only one set of footprints (in the sand)  it was then that He carried you.\"  We pray that God will wrap Marty in his arms and carry him through this journey.On behalf of our family  we ask you to use CaringBridge to post messages of support  love  strength  and encouragement  versus social media and other communication platforms.

Thanks so very much for caring about him and supporting him! IMPORTANT:  The offering of meals is so kind and generous.  However  food is not ideal at this time!  Thanks for understanding.What will my donation be used for ?All proceeds from this fundraiser will go directly towards Marty's current and future medical needs that  may not be covered by private medical insurance."

Medical costs after insurance will likely be several hundreds of thousand of dollars over the course of his recovery. These expenses are on top of the roughly $12K recent medical costs for his successful heart catheterization surgery this past spring.  We hope that you will join Davison and his family in the faith and full hope that he will conquer this  as he has so much adversity before.

A daughter  Kylie  was born February  2014. It was a happy  normal life.When Kylie was 6 months old  after a long July 4th weekend  Sean started showing alarming symptoms. He started hearing unusual sounds and would stare blankly ahead during these episodes. Sara took him to the emergency room and waited in the parking lot in the car with little Kylie. It was the beginning of a difficult and frightening journey for them both.A CT scan and MRI showed a tumor in the left temporal lobe of his brain  the speech center. And something sounded abnormal with his heart. More medical testing was ordered. A malformed aortic heart valve (never diagnosed before) had created a life threatening emergency  a very large aneurysm in his aorta. In a day and a half  Sean was diagnosed as needing open heart surgery and surgery for a brain tumor.  The two medical crises were unrelated. Sean looked healthy. He was an ex professional baseball player for God's sake.  Why is this happening? That was July  2014.Surgery #1His open heart surgery was performed in Atlanta two months later in September. The medical bills and anxiety had barely paused when it was time for…Surgery #2Two months of recovery passed. Next up for Sean was brain surgery  an awake craniotomy  which was also done in Atlanta in November. The medical team there wanted to opt for immediate chemotherapy and radiation following surgery. The two sought a second opinion  heading to Baltimore  MD and met with the top neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins  Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa. Dr. Q  as he’s affectionately known  felt almost no tumor had been removed and pledged he could remove nearly all of it. At that time  it was believed the tumor was benign. Only a few months later it was time for…Surgery #3 (brain surgery #2)Dr. Q operated on Sean in March  2015 in Baltimore. He said he was able to remove nearly all the tumor. However  this type of tumor  an anaplastic astrocytoma  has tentacles and infiltrates the brain where it can’t be removed. Testing on the tumor showed it to be grade 3 or malignant. It was more than a tumor now. It was definitely cancer.At this time  it was decided to monitor Sean with regular MRI imaging of his brain  to watch and wait.  This period  about a year and a half  offered a respite from surgery but not from the anxiety of the medical bills and fear of what may lie ahead. Another baby was born  Kaleb  and Sara was laid off from her 13 year corporate job. Sara has tried to help contribute financially during this time with teaching preschool  dog sitting and selling essential oils. Full time work has simply not been feasible because of the cost of day care and the travel and time associated with his surgeries. Financial stresses mounted. And the tumor returned.Surgery #4 (brain surgery #3)Dr. Q had moved his medical team to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  Florida. Sean and Sara followed him there. Surgery was done in December  2017. This time there would be no watching and waiting. It was time to attack the tumor  so radiation and chemotherapy ensued. Sean was monitored with more frequent MRIs  driving the 6 hours between Atlanta and Jacksonville every two months or less. He would sleep in his car in the Mayo Clinic parking lot to save money.The most recent MRI (3/7/19) showed a return of cancer. This time it was in another part of the brain  the hippocampus  where memory is stored. The medical team at Mayo and Dr. Q are opting for a 4th brain surgery. It’s urgent  because the tumor is growing.Surgery #5 (brain surgery #4)Scheduled for March 29  2019. Dr. Q hopes to remove the entire tumor this time. The tumor will be genetically tested to determine what post operative treatment will combat it the best. The expectation is Sean will undergo a medical trial at National Institutes of Health in Bethesda MD--more travel expenses. A new chemotherapy drug is the other possibility. This war against brain cancer has no end  just a new battle to be won each time it invades again.The Crushing Cruelty of CancerThroughout the last 4.5 years  Sean and Sara have tried to remain optimistic  tried to just carry on like the dark clouds aren’t there. So far  Sean has been able to work. Sadly  even though they have health insurance  the high deductibles  the continuing cost of all the care  and the travel necessary to get the best of medical care have depleted all their life savings  including 401K funds. I am Sara’s mom and write this because I see the unbearable stress of unrelenting  difficult health news coupled with never ending anxiety over bills.Last April  Sara unexpectedly got pregnant just before Sean’s chemotherapy was to begin. It felt like a positive miracle to them. Sadly  the baby died in the first few months of pregnancy. Of course  there were more bills  including charges for the D &C necessary for Sara to return to good health. Life can be so hard. And yet  Sara and Sean are so grateful for the good health and happy kids they are raising through these most stressful days.Except for close friends and family  Sean and Sara have chosen to keep this journey  this fight for his life private. It’s time to ask those who know them and perhaps a few that don’t for financial help. The worry about his family’s finances and his family’s future  not to mention his own future  creates a difficult environment in which to concentrate on healing and hoping for Sean. And for Sara… she is the power station that keeps it all running  including researching anything and everything available in the universe to combat cancer.  She is my hero.In the end  all most of us want is simple moments  normal times spent with family and friends. Cancer is cruel and wants to steal those times away. We can't let it win.Please consider contributing to Sean’s medical care and the family’s security. No amount is too small to help provide peace of mind as Sean's war against cancer continues. We will update this space following his 4th brain surgery March 29.Thanks for listening…Debi Gordon...Mom  Mother in Law  Grandmother"

Erik had no reason to think this shift would be unlike the countless others he’s served with his second family of fellow firefighters. Running calls  assisting the public  eating meals and laughing and joking with his crew. Little did Erik know that in less than 24 hours he would go from being someone who responded to the needs of others on some of the worst days of their lives to literally fighting for his own. Friday morning  less than 30 minutes prior to the end of his shift  Erik suddenly collapsed onto the floor of his Fire Station  his heart not pumping and his body not breathing. His crew  his second family feared the worst. Putting aside their shock they began the life-saving work that they were trained on for years. Training to be put to service helping the community they serve  but never with the thought of needing to save one of their own. Erik was found to be in a severely life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and was not breathing on his own. Thanks to the quick thinking of his crew  he was able to be defibrillated and his heart re-started. Unfortunately  Erik never regained consciousness. As firefighters  as paramedics we are used to coming to the assistance of others  it’s not in our nature to ask for help. Now we are asking for your help. Erik is currently in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of Aventura Medical Center. The diagnosis is that Erik’s lungs were somehow injured  probably from an infection he’d been harboring as many of the patients we come in contact with are fighting an illness of one kind or another. The doctors are unsure as to what caused his cardiac arrest but for now  he is on an ECMO machine. Being used to bypass his lungs  oxygenate his blood and keep his body and brain alive while his injured lungs heal.He has his wife. He has his childrenHe has his parents and familyAnd he has his fire & police family.

unfortunately  his condition was misdiagnosed as a cervical herniated disc issue for several months.  This resulted in a bilateral subdural brain hematoma.  His condition rapidly declined  and he was rushed unconscious to the NYU Medical Center in Manhattan on November 3  2017.  NYU performed a successful emergency Burr Hole surgery to remove blood and relieve pressure on his brain which fortunately saved his life. In late January 2018  after many months of investigatory testing and evaluation by specialists  an NYU neurovascular doctor reviewing a recent brain MRI correctly diagnosed Joe as suffering from Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension (SIH).  SIH is primarily caused by spinal CSF leaks and signifies low head pressure with sagging of the brain into the lower part of the skull.  Upon further consultation  Joe was astonished to learn that no hospitals in the Northeastern United States are equipped to identify and repair such spinal tears and that the nearest center for CSF leak treatment was at Duke University Medical Center in Durham  North Carolina.  Due to his bed-ridden status and residual brain hematoma  Joe was driven via emergency medical transport to Duke on February 20  2018.  After many weeks of aggressive testing  advanced imaging  numerous blood-fibrin glue patch treatments  and a targeted  complex spinal surgery in his mid-spine on March 30  2018  Duke was unsuccessful in repairing the lateral tear in his dura.  Joe’s painful symptoms worsened  and he continued to dangerously leak CSF from his spine.  Due to the serious  life-threatening complexity of his condition  Joe resolved to seek immediate treatment with Dr. Wouter Schievink at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.  Dr. Schievink is considered the world's expert on SIH and the identification and repair of CSF leaks.Once again  and after months away from his family in New York City  Joe desperately arranged for emergency medical transport from Duke and traveled cross-country to Los Angeles.  Immediately following rapid testing at Cedars-Sinai during a two-day period  Dr. Schievink performed an emergency surgery on May 30  2018 to repair the lateral tear at T7/T8 in Joe’s mid-spine utilizing two titanium aneurysm clips.  Additionally  testing at Cedars-Sinai identified other potential CSF leaking sites related to the use of a lumbar drain in the previous spinal surgery at Duke  sections of thin  porous dura possibly related to multiple  invasive spinal imaging punctures (i.e.  used to try to save Joe’s life by finding the exact locations of the CSF leaks in his spine)  several calcified discs with bone spurs  and numerous  independent spinal cysts along Joe's mid-spine.Due to the unresolved CSF leaking and resultant SIH  Joe continues to suffer from a multitude of chronic  unrelenting major symptoms (among so many others that are not listed):  terrible headache pain and pressure; severe back of head and base of skull pain/tension/pressure; entire neck pain/tension/pressure/stiffness with pulsating nerve and fluttering sensations; dizziness  brain fog and sinus pain/pressure; hearing loss  muffled/clogged ears and ringing in the ears; extreme  painful sensitivity to sound and touch; horrific  continuous spine pain with radiating nerve pain/impulses/twitches and burning sensations throughout the torso and back; muscle atrophy and chronic deconditioning from lack of movement; radiating  burning nerve pain from spine to arms and legs with muscle spasms/twitches and numbness; breathlessness  shortness of breath and coughing; weight loss due to muscle atrophy and lack of activity; and terrible fatigue and weakness.  After more than fifteen months of excruciating pain and suffering  countless evaluations and testing procedures  multiple blood-fibrin glue patches  and three major spinal surgeries (most recently on August 23  2018)  Joe is likely facing many additional challenges in the future to resolve his CSF leaks and finally become permanently “sealed and healed”.  Notwithstanding the threat to his life and the severe and debilitating symptoms associated with chronic CSF leaking  this condition is curable through targeted  surgical “sealing” procedures  patch treatments  significant bed-rest  stringent bodily movement restrictions  and gradual physical rehabilitation.  It is imperative that Joe is permanently “sealed” at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles before returning home to New York City. Prior to being stricken with this debilitating disease at 46 years old  Joe had been employed as a dedicated  hard-working attorney in the Compliance Department at Cantor Fitzgerald  L.P. in Manhattan since 2013.  After graduating from St. John’s University School of Law in 1999  Joe pursued a career on Wall Street as a litigation and compliance attorney at Republic National Bank  HSBC Bank USA  Bear Stearns & Co.  Inc.  and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.  Joe was extremely active and has many wonderful memories of sharing time with his family and friends.  Joe also enjoyed playing baseball  softball  stickball  running in New York Road Runner charity races  training for the NYC Marathon  and regularly playing soccer  going on hiking adventures and riding bikes with his children  John and Jessica.  Joe hopes to return to his former active life and career one day  but prays and dreams of simply rejoining his wife Vicky  John and Jessica  and his mom  Rose  in Astoria  New York to continue being an engaged  loving husband  father  son and friend.Although Joe and his mother have been living with extraordinarily gracious friends in the Los Angeles area for the past five months as he continues treatment with Dr. Schievink and the team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  his persistent struggle to heal and return to his family will require many additional months at best  and quite possibly another year.  Your life-saving financial contribution will ensure that Joe can continue to absorb associated medical expenses not covered by health insurance and arrange for a modest apartment rental (including payment of other living expenses) in the Los Angeles area.  You can help Joe win the battle for his life!  The La Micela Family will be forever grateful in their hearts for your generous gift  helping Joe return to his cherished life with family  friends and colleagues.Please find additional information regarding spinal CSF leaks at: https://www.cedars-sinai.org/programs/neurology-neurosurgery/clinical/csf-leak.html https://radiology.duke.edu/patient-care/specialized-services/spinal-csf-leaks-2-2/ https://spinalcsfleak.org/Joe La Micela and his family need your help!  Hope springs eternal and is the best stimulant of life!  Thank you for your generosity and caring support."

As she pulled over to the side of the road  the pain intensified so much she thought she was having a heart attack. After being picked up by paramedics and rushed to the nearest hospital she finally found out her left lung collapsed. She had been in so much pain refusing all pain opioids. Once Drs put two and two together she had an infection in her lung they drained it and was going to resume all activities at home however old blood started piling out of the lung giving cause to further concern. With permission  my sister Ashley allowed them to perform a CT Scan on her left chest wall and were stunned at what they found. A large tumor sprouting from the rib and latched onto the lung. It’s easily every fist new moms worst nightmare.   Action had to be taken and they induced her into labor 6 weeks early giving birth to a beautiful baby boy named Mateo. He is truly her light and sunshine. We call him her miracle baby. After Mateo had to spend a few weeks in the NICU it was now Ashley’s turn to start the fight for her life.   She grew this rare and very large tumor unnoticed for so long  her team of Drs wanted to fight it aggressively. She had to spend one whole week as an inpatient receiving harsh chemicals and drugs upon many of the nasty side effects. This occurred every other week instead of being home bonding with the baby. In November 2016  they performed an extensive 15 hour surgery to remove her partial left lung and reconstructed her spine with lots of hardware. After 14 rounds of painfully long chemotherapy sessions away from her child  they deemed her cancer free. No longer were the days that she was told she couldn’t hold her son  no longer were the days being stuck inside because blood counts were so low. It was the best news she received. And she celebrated! By traveling  spending time with family but most importantly making a come back at work which was always the goal.   Sadly this was was all very short lived. In January 2018 she got the news the cancer had returned this time time in a different place. Back to the hospital she went  back on chemo. Trying radiation this time to come at it from a different angle. It is is now March 2019. Ashley is still in the hospital fighting for her life everyday. She most recently caught the flu and has been bedridden and throughout these many months of treatment as a single mom struggling to find childcare for Mateo; the one thing that keeps her pushing. As you can imagine hospital bills are through the roof. And we most recently learned that Ashley’s job terminated her without notice  literally having nothing to fall back on. Luckily she has great private health Insurance but the cost of living with a toddler adds up and our mother who has been pushing her self to work half time to be able to make it back in time by the evenings to help with bedtime routine. Our mother is an angel. With that being said  going forward with any donations would greatly and truly be appreciated. Ashley is the last person to ask for a handout which is why I can’t see her struggle anymore.

Unfortunately  life is not always so neat and tidy.  Around Thanksgiving  Bob returned to the hospital with an infection in his lungs  similar to pneumonia  and shortness of breath related to the chemotherapy.  It turns out that the chemo drug given to Bob has a 1% chance of causing a serious lung infection/damage in some patients and Bob is part of that 1%.  To make a long story short  there have been many treatments which have resulted in Bob being placed in a medically induced coma so that a ventilator could be placed and a tracheotomy.  He is now in a third hospital to try an inversion therapy using a pronation bed to try to get different parts of his lungs working.   I know those are not all the correct technical/medical terms (and many other procedures and such have been done) but this is my basic understanding of what is going on.   So  why am I starting this Go Fund Me?  With the new year upon us  Bob's medical bills are already starting to pile up.  He has been out of work for 7 months and while his beautiful wife  Colleen  has a part-time job  she's also a homeschooling mom and obviously  her days and nights are largely spent caring for Bob and their daughters.  While you may read this and not know Bob and Colleen personally  I want to tell you that they are so deserving of our love and support during this remarkably difficult time.  Bob and Colleen have been close friends for years and  in fact  Bob and I went to Florida Southern College together years ago before we met again through Colleen.  They are the Godparents to my daughter  Ruby  and  in fact  were the people who introduced us to her!  They are kind  generous and fun people.  They are also filled with faith.  While they have resisted reaching out because they didn't want to be a burden on others  the time has come when they really do need help.  If you can help financially in any way  please do.  If not  please share this post and please place Bob  Colleen and their daughters in your daily prayers."

"Medical","December 19, 2018","Help us save Jon from the addiction epidemic","$54,240","$159,852","469","3","435","2.5k","HAMPTON","NJ","Hello visitors Our names are Michael and Casie ( Kathryn ) Fariello. We live in Union Township  Hunterdon County NJ. We have created this campaign for treatment for our son  Jon.  Jon is 17 years old and  is a junior at North Hunterdon High School. This year  he has only been able to attend 5 days of school due to addiction  depression and anxiety.Before we get into the tale of his addiction and mental illness  we want to share a bit about Jon as a person.  He is quick witted and smart.  He is charming and insightful.  He is a Life Scout  close to Eagle.  He is an athlete  competing in three seasons of track a year.  He cares about his friends and family.  He has a great concern for fairness. He is personable  well mannered and has a great sense of humor.  That is  when he's not on drugs or thinking about drugs.  These days  that's almost never.We have been working with him since June. It was in June when we discovered drugs in his suitcase while on a family trip.  He claimed this was experimentation  but as it turns out  it was actually  full blown addiction.We started off slow: home testing.  The positive results led us to  Intensive Out Patient treatment ( IOP ) at High Focus in Branchburg  NJ.  Relapses during those weeks led to residential treatment  at Newport Academy in Bethlehem  CT ( 30 days  as insurance would not pay for more  even thought statistically  it takes the average teen 90 days or MORE to embrace sobriety).  Upon return from there  Jon returned to High Focus in Branchburg for a Partial Hospitalization Plan ( PHP ). More relapses.  A suicide attempt.  Involuntary hospitalization at Carrier Clinic in Belle Meade NJ followed by residential treatment round 2 at Newport Academy again with the thought that he would not have to retell his story and could start with a head start by knowing his therapeutic team.  He was very angry at this point and did not really participate in the program.  He avoided school work  got into physical altercations  ran away  and crushed  another clients medication to be able to snort it.  This behavior led to an abrupt ending to Newport ( 21 days ). We ended up with the insurance company landing him home and no program to take him due to concerns of behavior.  Jon was  in no way willing to deal with the underlying reasons for his addiction  let alone give up the substance abuse.  We were told by the help we were receiving in NJ  that we had to take him home with us or they would call Child Protective Services.More relapses.  Last week  an overdose/suicide attempt. 7 days in a normal hospital  and now  admittance to a lock-down facility.  He will probably be released in 7 days.  To where?  To what?  This is what concerns us.  There is NO continuity of care except for our love.  Each place  every nurse  every doctor  and every therapist is like starting all over again.  He feels like he belongs nowhere  like nobody cares.Nothing could be further from the truth  but he can't see it.  He is loved.  He is worried about.  WE want him to see the light and to want to help himself.  He needs time and the proper environment.  We believe  High Focus and Newport Academy are both very good facilities that offer sincere programs.  They simply weren't enough for Jon.During these past several months of treatment   he has run away four times.  During those episodes  he has stolen  trespassed and hitchhiked.We  don't know the full extent of the drugs he has tried. He claims that he has not tried heroin or meth  but he has tried many others. Loads of different kinds of pills  3 grams of pot a day  alcohol  cocaine  vaping  ecstasy  LSD  mushrooms  PCP  the list goes on and on.  He is only 17 and he claims to have started slowly at 14 but has steadily increased since he started high school. We love our son. We are scared for our son. The last psychiatrist that we saw in the hospital said that ' Jon is the kind of kid that he is afraid for.....the kind of kid who will  will succeed in doing something impulsive and die\".  We live in lock down at our home.  Everything is behind locked doors.  He breaks the locks.  He punches holes in walls  he has destroyed furniture and nearly burnt the house down. We have read many books about addiction and worry that he will be a statistic. We participate in all the therapy sessions and are working the Al Anon program.  We are desperate.   We  do not have the funds to follow through with what is suggested to give him opportunity for recovery. Jon is currently in an involuntary hospitalization. The only place that would take him. We have 5-7 days of  knowing he is safe.  We are utilizing this time to proceed with a solution. We need to move quickly. We are meeting with a creative educational options consultant.  She has found the next step: Second Nature.  We are fully on board.He is angry. He's  punching walls at the hospital.  He refuses medications that might be of help. He does not want to stop. He does not see that his actions are a problem. He does not see that dealers coming to the house is a problem. The multiple visits  relapses and therapies have made it difficult for both of us to work. We have been getting some assistance from his grandparents but the following recommended treatment is essential and unattainable for us.When Jon is healthy  he speaks of a future as a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  We know he will make a good one  as he is caring and has great listening skills.   As an addict in recovery  he would have  the potential to help many people who often feel misunderstood.We are worried for our son and want give him the future that he deserves.With doctor fees  travel to facilities and co-pays  we have spent all our savings and maxed out our credit cards.  We are in serious debt but will pay that back over time.In the world  today  drugs are prevalent. We desperately want our son to not be a statistic.Please help us help him.  We sincerely appreciate a gift of any amount that will work towards getting Jon the help he needs.  How The Funds Will Be Used:Educational Consultant Fees(which will actually give us a dedicated advocate for one full year):$7500 WE RECEIVED A GENEROUS DONATION FOR THIS PIECE TO PAY DIRECTLYWe are using Nancy Greene as our Creative Educational Consultant who has been doing this for 21 years and helping many families. We feel fortunate to now have an advocate who will help us though the pitfalls.Transport services from Right Direction to get Jon to his new facility at Second Nature costs $5000.00. We paid by card and will reimburse our credit card for that.Second Nature Wilderness therapy: $35 000 - $49 800 for 8-12 weeks depending on his need. He will receive group  individual and family therapy as well as schooling. We are working with Second Nature to get some scholarship money  so that we will not have to use all of the initial funds that have already been generously donated.Therapeutic Boarding School called In Balance Ranch Academy in Tombstone  AZ: $9 800 per month for at least 15 months.Psychological Testing:  Once Jon is clean to see if there is underlying mental health issue besides depression and anxiety: estimated at $3000-$5000Possible fees for lawyers to advocate for school district assisting with partial payments and insurance advocates.  We are feeling blessed about that Aetna is  our insurance as of Jan 1st.For a total need of  $159.852.00.  This takes into account for the donations of $8105 given to us directly. ( Educational Consultant fees paid  and some donation brought o our home ) Time frame: $46  500 in the next 10 days  then 9 800per month for 15 months ending in June  2020 plus a travel experience that will cost $9000 and will involve two weeks of service in a community and a AA conference fee of $650 for air travel.. It is amazing already with how quickly donations have come in. We  will be sending Second Nature their initial intake fee and pay the first 30 days of services.  We will share  the exact amount of that once the financial aide package comes through.We have an email just for this helpforjon@gmail.comWe will be opening a bank account dedicated to this.We promise to keep everyone updated about expenses and progress.There are multiple updates for you to look at as you see our son progress and where he is now. We feel blessed with what we have been able to do so far and will continue to work for our son and our family! Thank you in advance Casie and Michael"

A former lone soldier from Texarkana  Texas  who was recently diagnosed with simultaneous Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin’s T-Cell Lymphoma  which rarely coexist. He is only 33 years old.About a year ago Sam became distant from our small group of friends. After not showing up to this year’s Thanksgiving dinner  he sent us a message with a photo. His words read: “So I have some news. I have been battling cancer for 8 months. It started off as simple lymphoma and recently spread to my brain and nervous system...You are all my family and I will always love you...” In the photo he was lying in a hospital bed  completely bald with one eye stitched closed. Sam explained to us that he was expected to be in remission by Thanksgiving. He just wanted to walk into the room knowing that he never had to burden his friends. This is a perfect example of his character  and exactly why he deserves our help. We all met in Israel  in 2009  on a program called Garin Tzabar. We lived together for two years while serving in the Israeli army as lone soldiers. We were just a bunch of young kids with a dream. Sam always stood out as a natural leader  and we all looked up to him. After enlisting in the IDF  he continued in a leadership role  building on his degree in education to train officer candidates in the Israeli Navy. Sam’s story  passion  and the quality of his work impressed his commanders so much that he received the Outstanding Presidential Award  given to the IDF’s top 120 soldiers each year. Sam devoted many years helping and caring for others  and now the time has come for us to take care of him. He currently lives in Israel with his girlfriend Shai who is standing by his side as he fights for his life.Our goal is to assist in treatment in any way possible. We ask you now to donate anything you can  and to please share this with friends  family  or colleagues you believe will be able to help reach this goal. Every penny counts  so please give whatever you can. We thank you for your time and effort in reading this and will provide updates as we move forward. Please message us if you have any questions at all  and please pray for Sam. His Hebrew name is שמואל בן נעמי.

Oscar enjoys legos  Fortnite  and playing with his friends.  In October 2018  Oscar complained of leg pain. Doctors initially attributed Oscar's discomfort to muscular or growing pain  and as the weeks progressed and up to New Year's Day  Oscar saw several doctors and all tests came back normal.  Despite the normal results  Oscar's pain continued and worsened  so he was referred for an MRI the day after New Years at CHKD in Norfolk  Virginia. The MRI results revealed a parent's worst nightmare  an aggressive spinal tumor that required immediate surgical intervention and biopsy. The surgery was performed on 1/8/19 and took approximately 7 hours. However  the surgeons were only able to remove ~20% of the tumor due to its invasive and aggressive nature. The biopsy results and diagnosis were reviewed with the Hasham family on 1/18/19 at CHKD  and Oscar is now home with his family in Williamsburg. The family consulted with Oscar's physicians on 1/29/19 to determine the most effective course of treatment going forward and Oscar will receive proton therapy from 2/19/19-4/15/19.  We will continue to keep everyone updated while respecting the family's privacy. Oscar is very strong and continues to fight  but his parents Omar and Kasia Hasham and Oscar's older brother Liam need everyone's continued love and support. Williamsburg Family Dentistry has established this gofundme to help the Hasham family through this difficult time  and allow the family to spend as much quality time as possible with Oscar. Please graciously support them in any way you can and share their story with all of your friends. #oscarstrong"

The kind of classmate that stands up for you when your Math teacher wants to give you a lower grade just because you wrote with a pencil  instead of pen. The kind of friend that will fit her hand in a squatting toilet to “rescue” your brand new mobile phone. The one who will wake up in the pitch black at 02:00 am to accompany her silly friends to the hospital  that irresponsibly ended up in a car crash. Even in the hardest times  after being diagnosed with Glioblastoma  Caci stood strong. She was the voice to re-assure us that it will be fine  and it will all end well. A year later  the results unfortunately look alarming (description below). We  her family and closest friends  are not able to cover the 200.000 USD medical bills. Therefore  we want to reach out to you - our friends  family  generous strangers: let us help Caci regain the same old  spurring energy and love for the world.  The story:Last Fall  our friend Caci got unexpected symptoms of numbness and heaviness in the right side of her body: first her leg  and then her arm. Being an ultra-active twenty-eight-year-old and busy on all fronts (work  Statistics club  Academy club  friends  trips  and what not) she thought these were just ordinary warnings that her body is tired and needs some rest. Unfortunately  the symptoms were a signal of a way more serious state. After surviving an epileptic attack  she was diagnosed with Glioblastoma – a malign tumor in the motoric cortex  of the left side of her head. An immediate surgery intervention was undertaken (in the private hospital Sistina  in Skopje  Macedonia)  followed by a radio therapy and nine cycles of chemotherapy. Initially  the results were pointing toward a positive aftermath. However  the latest MRI results are revealing that the tumor re-occurred and is rapidly progressing  with a quadruple growth in size  in less than a month. This called for a second rapid surgery intervention  that took place in Skopje  Macedonia. As this is one of the most aggressive versions of Cancer  she needs to be treated in a specialized hospital in the US  The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The analysis of the cells is still to be done  and the doctors cannot say for sure which is the targeted therapy at this point. However  the medical costs for any kind of treatment at the hospital are estimated at or exceeding 200.000 USD. Our voice:Dear friends  dear family members  dear colleagues  dear generous strangers This is the point where we ask you to help us and help our friend  Caci. Even the smallest contribution is a major step to saving the Life of this never resting altruist.It will mean the world to us to see her rollin’ as before. Caci's moving force  apart from staying strong and healthy  is the idea of starting a Cancer support group in Macedonia. Unfortunately  in our country  there is lack of such efforts.Of course  she can only do this by regaining her smile and winning this battle. This is not only her battle  it is ours as well!"

"Medical","March 23, 2019","Fighting Cancer While Expecting - Brianne &amp; Baby","$52,016","$25,000","830","24","877","4.4k","CHICAGO","IL","I have created this page to help support my sister Brianne (age 32)  her husband Hector (age 34)  and the first child they have on the way. Brianne is battling Stage 4 Fibrosarcoma which has metastasized to her lungs and pancreas  as well as lesions on her head  neck and back. While fighting for her own life  Brianne is carrying Baby Rodriguez.  * * * * *   Let me start at the beginning. Twenty years ago  Brianne was diagnosed with soft tissue cancer (Fibrosarcoma). Fibrosarcoma is a very rare cancer affecting fibrous tissue near bone. Only 1% of all cancers are sarcomas  of which 10% are Fibrosarcoma. At only 10 years old  this was a scary and overwhelming time for Brianne. She faced medical visits  biopsies  chemotherapy  surgeries and eventually limb removal. Her right arm was amputated just below the elbow in 1998 (putting her in remission).  In the years following  Brianne was fortunate to live a relatively normal young-adult life. Each year  Brianne's family and friends looked forward to celebrating her survival. On her remission anniversaries  we reflected on how lucky we've been to have her in our lives as a brave and beautiful daughter  sister  lover  granddaughter  niece  cousin and friend. Her last remission anniversary was celebrated on October 28  2018  -- 20 years cancer free  the way to be.  * * * * *  Just after her twentieth remission anniversary  in November 2018  Brianne found out she was pregnant. She and Hector had been trying for a baby and were overjoyed. Their excitement quickly turned to nervousness and worry  as it was early on in pregnancy when Brianne started noticing abnormal physical changes. Due to her medical history  any new lumps or bumps (other than a growing baby bump!) were immediately concerning. So  to the doctor she went.  * * * * *   That brings us to today. Brianne has been diagnosed with recurrent Fibrosarcoma. The ultrasounds  MRIs  CT scans  biopsies and pathology testing performed over the past several weeks have confirmed multiple masses throughout Brianne's body  including a 9 cm tumor in the lower lobe of her left lung  two smaller tumors in the upper lobe of her left lung  a suspicious nodule in her right lung  a 4 cm tumor near (or possibly invading) her pancreas and three lesions appearing on her head  neck and back. While the diagnosis is shocking  even more devastating is the fact that this type of Stage 4 cancer has a survival rate of only 16%.  The silver lining is that Brianne has been seeing a talented  knowledgeable team of Oncologists and Surgical Oncologists in South Carolina and at Duke University Medical Center. A recent genetic mutation study has confirmed that Brianne also carries the NTRK1 gene mutation  which is likely contributing to the cancer. In November 2018  the FDA approved a drug called Larotrectinib which targets the mutation with the objective of shrinking or eliminating tumors. It is the only drug of its kind and very new. Brianne has gotten approved for the drug. This may be her only hope for survival  other than a series of surgeries which might buy time but probably wouldn’t result in a cure.  * * * * *  And what about Baby Rodriguez? Currently  Brianne is 25 weeks pregnant and carrying a healthy baby. However  her life is in danger as she continues on with the pregnancy. It is likely that Brianne will deliver a very pre-term baby at 28 weeks  so she can then start on the Larotrectinib. If this happens  Baby Rodriguez will stay in the neo-natal intensive care unit for an estimated three months or until the original due date of July 7  2019.  * * * * *  A few more facts:  1. Brianne and Hector are both still working. However  time off work is eminent. Brianne will need to take an unpaid leave of absence from her job for maternity leave and eventual cancer treatment and/or surgeries. As a young physician (allergist)  Hector is still paying off a significant sum of medical school loans and working hard to support his sick wife and growing family.  2. The annual out-of-pocket insurance maximum for Brianne and Baby Rodriguez is $14 000 ($7 000 per individual). This is why I have started the fundraising goal at $25 000.

With the recurrence of the cancer  Joe is unable to work.  Christine is caring full time for Joe and their children.  While it has been a tough year for Joe and his family  there has also been a bright side to him not working. Joe has been able to spend an amazing amount of time with his two young children this year; he has been able to volunteer at their school; walk them to and from school everyday; and help with coaching their sports and homework. These things have been a gift to Joe  his wife  and children. Joe is a unique individual.  To those of us who call him \"friend\" or \"family\"  Joe sparkles with warmth  love  compassion and caring.  He is a funny  passionate  nurturing  loyal and empathetic friend to all who are lucky enough to be part of Joe's extended community/family.  Joe navigates through his life with grace  compassion and a sense of adventure. He loves to travel anywhere he can on two wheels rather than 4  glides around on his skis adventuring in the mountains and spends every spare minute with his family and friends. Joe has a big battle ahead of him.

Lots of tears  intense physical pain  the inability to sleep  and feelings of despair. As you know  I did extensive research on clinics all over the world and decided I want to get treatment at the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Mexico. It’s a 3 week inpatient program of cutting edge nontoxic treatments  they treat the disease holistically  and I know it’s the right place for me. It includes a plethora of different daily treatments from 7 different modalities: Non-Toxic Cancer Therapies  ImmunoModulation  Full Spectrum Nutrition  Detoxification  Oxygenation  Restore Microbiome  and Emotional/Spiritual Healing. It also includes accommodations for 2 (so Jeff can come with me)  3 organic vegan meals per day plus organic juices and smoothies for both me and Jeff  and two follow-up visits for me after 3 months and 6 months. When I leave  they give me enough Sunivera Immunotherapy (which includes GcMAF) and MaraGen to continue my treatments at home for 3 months  and the Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy device I need to continue that treatment at home for 1 year. The cost is $47 000  which is why I started this GoFundMe page. The campaign started off gangbusters  but has tapered off  not surprisingly. What you don’t know is that I have a large inoperable tumor over my sternum that is attached to my sternum bone and chest wall and it’s been growing quite aggressively  so every day that goes by where I am in physical pain and not able to start treatment has been unbearable.A couple named Olivia and Larry Cook saw my post about this on Instagram ~ their account is @naturalhelperx. They reached out to me as philanthropists who want to give as much as possible to people in need before the end of 2018. I was so excited  and I emailed them all about my situation. They replied that they could send me all the money I needed  but I would have to send them a $107 transfer fee. My heart sank. I Googled their email address and discovered that they are scam artists who prey upon homeless people and people in dire health crises. I started sobbing tears of despair.Well  today I am crying tears of joy. Jeff did something heroic for me  something he would ordinarily have never considered ~ he made an early withdrawal from the IRA he’s had since high school to get me the remaining money I need to start my treatment! We’re leaving early tomorrow (Monday) morning  and we will be back on Christmas Day! There is a 60-day window within which he can replace that money so as to maintain the health and integrity of the account and not have to pay taxes and major penalties on that early withdrawal  so I am determined to make that happen. If you can make a donation  even if it’s just a few dollars  I would be eternally grateful. Every bit helps. GoFundMe does take 3% of each donation  so if you'd prefer to donate to me via PayPal  my email is funny@suzannewhang.com -- be sure to use the \"Send to Friends and Family\" option so that I don't get charged a service fee.Or you can mail me a check ~ send an email to me at gookwaffle@gmail.com and I will give you my address.I am SO relieved and excited to start my treatment! Thanks to every one of you for your emotional and financial support  and special thanks to Jeff Vezain  my twin flame  the love of my life  and my knight in shining armor.  By the way  we never got around to breaking up...Send me good energy  and I look forward to regaling you with magnificent stories about my path back to wellness!Love Suzanne+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Original post (11/15/18)Holy crapwaffle.  I can't believe this is happening again.  I'm taking this Asian overachiever thing to a whole new level.  You know how they say God doesn't give you anything you can't handle?  Well  God must really think I'm a badass.  Here's a video of my journey that was done in 2015: https://youtu.be/-MjDg0n_R1kBack in 2011 when I was given 6 months to live from stage 4 breast cancer  I went $500 000 in debt from cancer treatments that were not covered by my insurance.  With the help of family  friends  and fans back then  I raised about $250 000 from online fundraisers and fundraising events.  I thought I had reversed the cancer and was cancer-free since 2011  but it turns out that while the tumors were gone  the cancer stem cells were not.I wanted to gather as much information as possible before creating this fundraiser.Don't let my goal amount intimidate you.  Every dollar helps.So... here's the latest chapter of my story.  On the evening of Oct 15th as I was driving home from my friend Vanessa’s birthday party ~ I started experiencing intense chest pains  shortness of breath  and tingling in my left arm.  I thought I was having a heart attack  so I asked Jeff to take me to the emergency room at Providence St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank.  I also have a bump over my sternum from what I thought was costochondritis caused by my T-10 vertebra kyphoplasty back in 2011.  Several times in the past  I've had costochondritis which is inflammation caused by lifting something heavy and irritating the area over the sternum ~ I would ice it and rest for a few days  and it would disappear completely.  The ER doctor  Dr. Herrera  did an EKG on me  and it came back normal.  That ruled out a STEMI heart attack.  Then he did blood tests on my cardiac enzymes that all came back normal.  That ruled out a non-STEMI heart attack and a blood clot.  Then he did an x-ray of my sternum  which came back normal.  That ruled out a broken bone.  And then he did a CT scan.  About an hour later  Dr. Herrera came into to my ER room with the CT scan results and a sad look on his face.  He said that this bump over my sternum is cancerous.  He said that's what was causing my chest pains.  He also found lesions on the bone of my sternum  on two of my ribs  and in both of my lungs.  The test results are consistent with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.  So this is now my second time with stage 4 cancer.  Fuck.  He gave me a tiny dose of morphine to help me with the pain (the dosage they use for small children)  because I am a lightweight when it comes to medication.I was devastated.  Jeff was in the ER hospital room with me when I got the CT scan results  thank God.  He's been incredibly kind and loving and supportive.  Then I remembered a documentary that a friend recently told me about called \"The Truth About Cancer \" so I watched it.I already knew some of the information from my research in 2011  but a lot of it was brand new to me and incredibly eye-opening.  It was fascinating  infuriating  and ultimately inspiring.Here it is  if you haven't seen it and are interested.Episode 1:   https://youtu.be/KqJAzQe7_0gEpisode 2:   https://youtu.be/VK_sX5ko8SEI am now energized and optimistic about reclaiming my health and curing the cancer at the root  this time permanently.The next day after being in the emergency room  I was on the phone on hold for 6 hours with different physicians and branches of Medi-Cal (the health insurance that I have)  in order to get an approved referral to Dr. Berkowitz  who was my oncologist in 2011 and the only holistic oncologist I've ever encountered.  He's awesome because he's open-minded.  I'm working towards getting referred to him  which is turning out to be much more difficult that I was told.In the meantime  I've been using CBD  cannabis salve  frankincense oil  and eating organic vegan.  After extensive research  I have selected the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Baja.  It's an inpatient 3-week program.  Here is a link to the clinic: http://www.hope4cancer.com/I will be receiving Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sono-photo-dynamic-therapy/And will be given what I need to continue my therapy for one year at home after I check out of the clinic.And MaraGen: https://ph.pronuvia.com/products/maragen/I will be given a 3 month supply to continue taking at home after I check out of the clinic.I will also be receiving Sunivera Immunotherapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sunivera-immunotherapy/And I will receive injections to continue the treatment at home for one year.I need to raise $47 000 ASAP ~ because the sooner I get to the clinic  the sooner I can start these treatments.The reason I'm trying to raise more money is because I don't want to stress about having to work for a couple of months  and my new healthy lifestyle will include food and supplements and treatments in LA to maintain my health (including things like acupuncture  massage  hyperbaric oxygen  hyperthermia  etc.)Please feel free to share this fundraiser with anyone you think might be willing to help me.Remember  if you're wealthy  you can donate up to $14 000 tax-free as a gift to any individual once a year.  Hope 4 Cancer Institute's program includes transportation from San Diego  accommodations for 3 weeks  3 organic vegetarian meals daily  juices and smoothies  not just for me  but for a companion as well -- Jeff is going to come with me!  It includes every treatment each day (up to 8 different kinds)  and all the treatments I take with me to continue at home.Here's how you can help me ~ visualize me getting better permanently this time  eradicating all the cancer stem cells this time.  Don't worry about me or tell me how worried you are.  That's doesn't help me.If you don't agree with my path  keep it to yourself.  I have done thousands of hours of research since 2006  and I am in charge of my recovery.  If you want to share with me some new revolutionary treatment or holistic or naturopathic or nutrition-based information  first ask me if I've tried it or heard of it  and then ask if I want to learn more.If you can't afford to make a donation  please share this with someone who might be able to.Thank you in advance for caring about me.  I know that once again  I will be loved back to life.And if I happen to see you somewhere out and about in the LA area  please hug me gently  because of my sternum tumor.  I am in a lot of pain today  but most days I feel good.With love  gratitude  optimism  and confidence that I will reclaim my health ~Suzanne"

By day 5  his was paralyzed  on a respirator  and fighting for his life in the Intensive Care Unit at the Northeast Georgia Medical Center. After days of no diagnosis and not knowing what was wrong  his family received the heartbreaking news that David had contracted West Nile Virus and as a result  a condition similar to Guillain-Barre Syndrome which attacks the nervous system. His prognosis was months of hospitalization and a recovery that could take up to a year or more.  He received a tracheostomy and a feeding tube.  After 4 weeks in ICU and life-saving treatments  David’s condition began to stabilize.  Fortunately  he was referred to and accepted at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta.  David was then transferred via ambulance for continued acute medical care and the beginning of rehabilitation for which the Shepherd Center is legendary.After 3 months of intense physical  occupational and speech therapy at the Shepherd Center  David is being discharged and coming home to a long and arduous recovery ahead. Ahead of his release  he is showing slight yet important signs of recovery. While confined to a hospital bed  a team of technicians use a lift to move him to a specialized wheelchair that he controls with the movement of two fingers on his right hand.  David has regained some movement in his legs  yet he is months away from the hope of taking steps on his own. While there are small signs of nerves twitching in his arms  they remain completely immobile. David now speaks through a valve on his tracheostomy and is being weaned from the respirator that is on hand to breathe for his weakened lungs when necessary.Throughout his ordeal  David still has his faith  his humor  his brilliant mind and his sweet disposition.He is not giving up and is fighting hard every day to return to a normal life and the people who love him.How Will Donations Be UsedThe harsh reality of David’s return home will be the need for specialized  skilled nursing care 24 hours a day  seven days a week in order to keep him alive and on the road to recovery.  For the foreseeable future  David will remain confined to a hospital bed and wheel chair. With no use of his arms  he will be dependent for every aspect of his daily life. With his respiratory issues and complete immobility  David must never be alone. The cost of caregivers and therapy could reach more $25 000 a month. David will need a van specially equipped to transport him to therapy  a back-up manual wheelchair  a special chair for bathing and modification to our home none of which are covered by insurance.  There will also be medical bills and other expenses we have yet to imagine.Our GoalWith the right care and your support  David can continue on his journey to recovery.  He will walk again.  He will breathe on his own again. He will hold his first grandchild to be born in June.Join us in our fight for David.  Consider a donation and please help spread the word.Forever Hopeful Jessie Johnston CarmonDavid’s Devoted Wife"
"Medical","January 7, 2019","Tracey&apos;s Cancer Recovery","$51,630","$50,000","288","3","300","176","LOSANGELES","CA","My name is Melinda. This fundraiser is for the sweetest and strongest human being in my life. I've known Tracey for 10 years and she is one of my best friends. She has been the most giving and independent individual that I and many countless others have crossed paths with. Not many people are familiar with the burdens that she faces  but from a young age she has always taken care of herself and others due to her family’s struggles.  She always kept a big beautiful smile on her face regardless of any given struggle.In March of 2015  her father lost the fight to liver cancer. On April of 2018  her son Gianni Cove Pezzola was born.  Doctors noticed a blue baby with a heart murmur and shortly broke news of his condition - Tetralogy of Fallot   a congenital heart defect which results in obstruction of blood flow.  At just three months old  her son had a successful open heart surgery. Through it all  Tracey kept that smile going and her spirits remained high while she continued to push endlessly for her family. In July of 2018  Tracey became pale and faint and admitted herself to the emergency room. Blood labs came back showing cancerous cells. A bone marrow biopsy was taken to confirm her diagnosis - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . MDS are conditions that can occur when the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow become abnormal. Tracey is deficient in red blood cells  white blood cells   and platelets. Tracey's immune system started to attack itself.  She has been dependent on blood and platelet transfusions every other day.  She experiences shortness of breath and severe migraines with chemotherapy  which resulted her to stay at the hospital for weeks without her Cove and fiancé  Jay. A bone marrow transplant (BMT) is the only cure to prevent the disease going into Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)   a life-threatening and aggressive form of blood cancer. On January 5  2019  Tracey received a second chance at life. It was confirmed that a 10/10 matched unrelated donor was identified through Be The Match foundation.  This treatment and recovery is not easy. It is an exhaustive  painful  and an expensive process. The transplant replaces the cells in Tracey's bone marrow with the cells from a donor's healthy bone marrow. She will be quarantined in a hospital bed for a minimum of 6 weeks. Tracey will need to have 24-hour care for several months following.Due to the cancer  she is unable to work. After receiving her fifth round of chemotherapy  I yelled at her and called her crazy for working while undergoing treatment. I’ve always looked at Tracey with admiration not only because she is the strongest and toughest woman I know  but because she is determined to put her loved ones first. Sitting across from her as several IVs were coming out of her arm was the hardest thing for me to see.  At that moment  she looked weak and helpless and it broke me to see that. After her chemotherapy that day  she had asked me to take her to buy a Christmas gift for her fiancé (I still thought she was crazy). Not to mention  a few days prior to getting treatment  she drove 7 hours to stand by the birth of her best friend Tiffany's child. As you can see  Tracey is a relentless fighter. She is selfless  compassionate  and has a heart of gold. Unfortunately  the fight to be cancer free puts a heavy strain on any family. The funds will help Tracey pay for the best medical and pharmaceutical care so she can be at peace in hopes of shifting her focus on a full recovery. I made this page solely to send positivity  raise awareness  and support to Tracey through her long journey to conquer cancer. Tracey is loved by so many and I need her to know that we are fighting this fight with her.  I will keep you all updated on Tracey's journey.Thank you to everyone for all of your support!

Luckily  the medical team at UCLA were able to contain Chad’s situation  quickly identify a best course of action and within 48 hours of submission performed an operation to remove the majority of the mass in his brain. Chad is a couple of days post-operation  and is progressing incredibly well all things considered. After seeing him today  and talking with his family  I feel confident that with proper care Chad will make a full recovery. However  the reality is that Chad will need and has needed major treatment  care and rehabilitation. This is just the beginning of his journey towards getting back to what he loves doing; helping a great community of individuals enjoy the best golf of their lives. We have started a GoFundMe campaign to support the medical bills and associated expenses that will come for Chad and his family as they recover from this trauma.

1/25/2019  just 8 days after he left the hospital and checked into a rehab center in hopes of regaining his strength to continue his fight with cancer.  I cannot imagine the pain he must have felt  considering how fast this disease took his life.  I am glad I was able to spend time with him in his last days  not only to witness the courage that he had in facing his greatest adversity  but also to meet many of his friends who came to visit him.   They all had many great things to say about him  and shared with me their stories of how they met  what a great friend he was to them  and how he has made an impact on their lives.  I am in awe of the admiration given to my brother  and I am proud to have him as my family.John's funeral was held on 2/2/2019  on a beautiful Saturday morning and attended by more than one hundred loving friends and family.  John's lovely and talented daughter  Moncher Lee  dedicated a song to him on the violin  and played \"You Raised Me Up\"  by Josh Groban.  It was a very touching performance that complemented a lovely service.  John was laid to rest at Kensico Cemetery  in Valhalla  NY.  Fifty eight of his family and closest friends attended the burial.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Original Story:My brother HingKui John Lee was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with liver metastasis in September 2017.  He began chemotherapy treatment in November of that year  after recovering from two emergency surgeries (one to remove part of his colon and another to place a stent in his artery to alleviate edema to his legs) and a paracentesis  a procedure that drained excess fluids in his abdomen caused by his diseased liver.  John responded well to the chemo treatments and was able to return to work in March 2018.  He would continue to receive chemo every other week to keep the cancer in check.  In December 2018  John received frightening news that the different treatments that he has been taking are no longer effective in controlling the cancer.  He was given Mitomycin-C by his oncologist as a third-line treatment on January 2nd  2019.  A week later  his belly had grown so big that he had to go to the hospital to have a paracentesis procedure to remove the ascites built up in his abdomen.  The hospital staff removed 5.5 Liters of fluid from his body.  He went home the next day but developed a fever the day after.  He went back to the hospital on January 11th 2019 and has not returned home since.    Over the next few days  his appetite decreased drastically and the severity of pain he felt increased.  He is normally a person with high pain tolerance and his facial expressions indicated he was suffering.  When he could no longer tolerate the pain  he asked for hydromorphone.  While the medication relieved some of his pain  it also gave him many side effects  including drowsiness  nausea  headaches  and difficulty in using the bathroom.  A second paracentesis was performed on him and this time over 7 Liters of fluid was drained from him.  A Tenckhoff catherer was put into his abdominal area so that future drainage could be done at his bedside.  Three bedside drainage have been done so far  draining 300ml  600ml  and 975ml respectively  with future drainage to be done every other day.   John's health continued to worsen during his stay at the hospital.  Then on January 16th  two weeks after his latest chemo treatment  doctors from the hospital and the cancer treatment center had a meeting with John and his family to discuss his condition and treatment options he should consider.  He was told that due to the aggressiveness of his cancer  his prognosis was very bad and he has at most 6 months to live.  He had two options: A) stop cancer treatment and focus on hospice care that would manage his symptoms and provide comfort for the remainder of his life or B) go to rehab   attempt to overcome the symptoms caused by the cancer  regain his strength  and maybe try Mitomycin again or Oxaliplantin that gave him a bad reaction before.  The chances of succeeding are very very slim to none and the possible risks and side effects could outweigh the benefits.  John  being the fighter that he is  chose to go to a rehabilitation center to continue his battle with cancer.  Myself  my two other siblings  and his wife are fully supportive of his decision  and will stay by his side day and night to provide care for him in this fight for his life.John Lee is a very altruistic person and he loves to help people any way he can.  After college  he worked as a social worker for some time for the Chinese American Planning Council and provided services to new immigrants to overcome language barriers they faced in their adopted country.  After becoming a father of two special needs children  he left a good paying corporate job and went back to school to become a Speech Language Pathologist to help his own children as well as others in the special needs community.   He is an advocate for kids with special needs and often tries to educate the public about Autism Spectrum Disorder.  At church  he was involved in ESL teachers training and special needs children Sunday School.  He became very involved in his cancer support community by serving in its Participant Advisory Council and helping with fundraising efforts.  He has a big heart  a generous personality  and has made a difference in the lives of many people.  He is filled with love  hope  faith  and strength.  Read More About John Here

Upon arrival  the skilled and knowledgeable care provided by St. Mary’s Medical Center’s ER staff went to work trying to save Bruce’s life.  He sustained a myriad of life threatening injuries including a lacerated skull with a cranial bleed  a lacerated kidney (which was removed that evening)  two partially collapsed lungs  a broken clavicle  several broken ribs  a broken pelvis  fibula and tibia.  He was heavily sedated and placed on a ventilator to assist his body in trying to begin the healing process.  They were not sure that Bruce would make it through the night.Immediately  family and friends were notified and prayer vigils began.  There were people around the globe saying The Rosary for Bruce that he might recover and go on to live a fulfilling life with his family.Doctors are not able to say when Bruce might expect to see a return to his old self.  Every patient is different but the family is encouraged knowing Bruce’s determination and personal drive. Bruce’s medical bills will undoubtedly be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and tragically  Bruce is not covered by health insurance.  He was the sole bread winner of the household and this financial burden is enormous.  Many of you know Bruce and Donna and their two sons Brucey and Kenny.  Bruce and Donna are some of the most kind  generous people there are.  Bruce would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it.  What they have gone through this past week is something no one should ever have to endure.  This accident has been devastating to them and their family.  Donna  Brucey and Kenny’s strength in holding it all together has been unwavering and they will continue to be by Bruce’s side moving forward together.  This amazing family needs our help.  So I ask you this simple question:  If you can spare a few dollars to help  please listen to your heart and give to this fund.  No amount is too small and anything you can contribute would be so meaningful to them.  Bruce’s recovery will be very hard  painful and long - but if anyone can prevail it will be Bruce Sweet!  Let’s show them - we can make a difference - as they rebuild their lives after this tragic accident."

He ended up being admitted to the hospital that evening being told there was a severe infection in his hand and arm. They put him on antibiotics and were waiting on test results to determine what it was and how bad. Christmas morning  it was determined that he has a flesh eating bacteria called Necrotizing Fasciitis and they needed to take him into surgery right away. The infection has spread rapidly and is from his fingers all the way up to his chest. 1 out of 3 does not survive this. Thus far he has had 2 surgeries to clean out the infection and is scheduled for another one this evening. Brendan is fighting hard to get rid of this but is not out of the woods yet. He is under sedation and intubated to keep his body resting and so the doctors can continue to clean his infection. Brendan is an amazing man! He loves his job as a ski instructor and being around the kids he teaches. He is deeply missed on the mountain right now while he fights.

He is a neural linguistic programmer  with a masters in Social Work.

But outside of this  he is an amazing friend  father  husband  grandfather and more! A few weeks ago he had started to have some speech issues  and checked himself in to Tampa General. At this time they did a CT scan and discovered a mass in the speech center of his brain. From there  the journey became a bumpy and overwhelming ride.  After quickly returning to Denver  he had meetings with a neurologist and neurosurgeon  and it was determined that his mass (tumor) had to be removed.  His surgery took place on 2/4 and the neurosurgeon was successful in taking 100% of it out.  While this is great news  we are spinning at some additional news that this tumor is classified as a grade 4 glioblastoma  a type of brain cancer.  After he is healed from surgery  he will have 6 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy.  He is currently working hard at regaining his speech as his brain is still very swollen from surgery.  As many of you are finding out the news  many are asking what they can do to help.  While being self-employed and owning his own company has always been an accomplished dream of our Dad's  the reality is he doesn't have the luxury of things like paid time off or FMLA.  We have created this page for our Dad and his current medical expenses.

Gazi Yasargil.  He is affectionately known as \"The Professor\" and is widely considered to be the father of brain Microneurosurgery.  He developed both the instruments and the techniques needed to perform such intricate procedures.  He is of Turkish descent but practiced in Zurich for many years.  In Europe  however  there is a mandatory retirement age for surgeons and he retired there in 1993.  He may have retired in Europe but was not done performing miracles.  He came to the U.S. and ran a neurosurgical residency at the University of Arkansas Medical Center.  Through a series of miraculous events  Laura was able to become his patient in Little Rock  just a couple weeks after diagnosis. At the time he was 82 years old.  And he saved her life.  Fast forward to today.  In September  Laura had her routine MRI and it showed some spots that were possible for reoccurrence.  She sought advice from various surgeons and had a second MRI at the end of November.  Laura has new tumor growth and in addition to that has two cysts that have been growing somewhat rapidly that have started to cause her some significant numbness and weakness on her left side.  She has now been advised to have surgery as soon as she is able.  Her scans have been sent to a number of surgeons and institutions around the country and world.  And understandably  she sent them to Dr. Yasargil in Turkey.  He is no longer performing surgery but is very strong and has all of his faculties at the age of 93.  He and his team have been very involved in Laura's case from day one and Dr. Yasargil wants her to come to Turkey to have surgery  which would actually  be done by his protégé  who practices there under his watchful eye.  In addition  Laura's neurosurgeon in Michigan who originally sent her to Dr. Yasargil the first time also believes that going to Turkey under The Professor's guidance would give her the best chance at another good outcome.  Much thought and prayer and medical input has gone into this decision  but Laura has decided that she wants to be under the care of Dr. Yasargil again.  And I don't blame her.  We all trust him and his judgement. So  Laura needs to get to Turkey rather quickly and is in the process of preparing travel documents and plans  etc.  The only drawback is that regular insurance doesn't cover one choosing to have brain surgery in Turkey.  The surgeon's fees are going to be waived (which is a tremendous blessing)  but that leaves travel expenses  hospital stays  anesthesia  various medications  nurses  etc. that still need to be payed for.  In addition  there is no way of knowing yet how long she may need to remain in the hospital after surgery or in Istanbul for rehabilitation.  Laura and her husband Wade had both recently come back to Michigan after having lived in both Alabama and Virginia over the last two years.  Laura had been in the process of interviewing for new jobs when the MRI results came in.  But she is currently unemployed.  So now they are faced with a major medical situation and a large sum of money needed in order to see it through.  We have been told that the medical fees for the things listed above will be upwards of $50 000 or more.  We have faith that the Lord will provide and make a way.  It is difficult and humbling to have to ask for help.  But we ask that you prayerfully consider donating.  Any and every donation is so incredibly helpful.  We appreciate and cherish anything that you may be able to give.  With much love and gratitude Jean Tinning Virkus and Family"

My brother Jaime has always been the one supporting and guiding not only the family but also friends and colleagues.I will never forget when my brother was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in August 2018  my nephew (my brother's youngest son) told me that he didn't need anything but for me and the family to pray for his dad. I said of course we are all ceaseless praying for Jaime's health.Jaime is a Commercial Pilot based in Lima  Peru and works for a Latin America Airline and he for sure followed his dream of flying commercial planes with passion. My brother wanted to fly airplanes since an early age  it wasn't an easy road for him since the aviation jobs had just started to take off in Peru and having ground training and also trying to get more than 1 500 hours of flight experience was a challenge. But his dedication and hard work got him to where he is today \"Captain Cabrera\".On September 30 Jaime and his wife Kathy left their home  3 sons  jobs  family and friends to go to Tampa  Florida where Jaime is receiving medical care at Moffitt Cancer Center  a world leader in Leukemia treatment. Under the guidance of Dr. Lancet and Dr. Pidala  he is receiving a regimen of chemotherapy in conjunction with other medicine not available in Peru.Armed with faith  we are willing to lose everything in order to give Jaime the opportunity to have a second chance in life. Time is crucial  the next step will be to undergo a bone marrow transplant as soon as he is in remission. Funding will help pay for the only option he has to recover and it's the bone marrow transplant which is not covered by his insurance.Jaime is bravely fighting with and for his family  with your help and with your donations we can win this battle together.  We are grateful for all the love and support that we've been receiving during this difficult time.  Every donation counts and it's truly appreciated."

He is a wonderful son  brother  nephew  grandson  and friend to all!  His bright smile brings happiness to everyone he meets!!On the morning of December 6th  2018 Thomas Wichmann had a convulsive seizure and was transported to U of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital.  Later that morning  after an MRI scan  a brain cancer mass was discovered in the left parieto-occipital supratentorial region.   After many second opinions they ended up at St. Jude in Memphis  TN for surgery.  Thomas' surgery lasted 8 hours.  Although there were worries about speaking and vision   Thomas greeted everyone with a \"ciao\" just a few minutes after waking up. He even kicked a soccer ball to score a goal that Rafi had made!To everyone’s surprise his recovery from surgery has been tremendous.  They have an amazing team of doctors to thank and also Thomas' spirit and strength.Right now  they are back in  Minnesota  possibly until Feb. 11th  and will then fly back to Memphis.  Unfortunately with the cancer being an aggressive one  Thomas will have to undergo treatments for many weeks at St. Jude's.They have a hard road ahead but Thomas has already proven to everyone how strong he is.   Thomas is lucky enough to have 2 wonderful younger brothers who are being supported by their network of family and friends at home.  This is requiring a lot of travel between Iowa  Italy  Chicago  etc.  We do know that either Rafi or Nathan  will be going back and forth from St. Jude to MPLS during his treatments while the other one stays at his side.  At this point  we don’t know all of the medical  travel  living etc expenses that they will incur  but we do know that it will be extensive.  As a community of friends and family  we all want to help support the Wichmann family as much as we can!As more information is shared  we will update this site   but at this moment  any and all donations are appreciated.  Please pass this along to anyone who either is blessed to know Thomas and the wonderful Wichmann family or simply has it in their heart to contribute to trying to ease their burden. We are praying for them every day and hope that a cure is found and we can't wait to see Thomas back on that soccer field!!ANY FUNDS THAT THE FAMILY DOES NOT USE WILL BE DONATED TO ST.

Christine Champion  one of the most loving and brilliant people to ever be a part of our world  is suffering from Stage 4 cervical cancer. She is very sick  but there is hope. For many of us  Christine needs no introduction. Those that know her  those that have had the honor of working with her  understand she is simply an angel on this Earth. For those that may not know her  she is a leader  a teacher  a guide  a mentor  a mother  a wife  and a truly brilliant and amazing woman. She loves  helps  and heals as if it were her sole purpose in life  and she is now in need of our help.HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON:Troubling symptoms  which were misdiagnosed  started appearing 2 years ago. Last January  her gynecologist discovered a tumor on her cervix  which Christine bravely chose to fight with homeopathic measures. Unfortunately  this has not been successful  and Christine has lost nearly 80 pounds as the tumor has doubled in size. The cancer is spreading to her nodes  and last week she underwent intense surgery on her kidneys. She is weak  but holding on. TREATMENT: There is a clinic in Germany (St. George -- st-george-hospital.com) close to where Christine lives that is renowned for their treatments blending kemo/radiation with natural remedies so toxicity levels in the body stay as low as possible. This treatment has a high success rate  but is expensive  and her insurance will not cover it.Christine and her husband Wayne have been financially devastated by the mounting costs of her healing and their insurance has been unsupportive  to say the least. If Christine is to have a chance  she must undergo intense treatment as soon as humanly possible. We need to raise this money  and raise it fast if we are to help her fight this awful disease. Christine has dedicated herself in service to others for years  helping thousands of people heal spiritually  mentally  and physically  all over the world. She has touched many hearts and left a trail of emergence and evolution in her wake. Despite her sickness  she's staying positive and keeping her vibrations high  but time is running out. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SAVE SOMEONE’S LIFE. It’s that clear. You can be the hero she needs. Please...if there’s anything you can give  I encourage you to. If we band together  if we raise this money quickly  we can keep this magnificent soul alive and well in her Earthly figure. She deserves it  and would do the same for all of you. Christine needs our help. Please  please  help. For those that can’t give  please keep her in your thoughts and prayers. Please send her strength. Please ask your higher powers to assist her. Please take some time to send her love and well wishes.

Brian was diagnosed with appendix cancer a little over five years ago when his appendix suddenly burst. Due to his appendix bursting the cancer spread to his peritoneum.  The peritoneum is a lining on the inside of the abdomen and on the outside of organs like the intestines and liver.  Since then he has had to endure numerous surgeries  two HIPEC surgeries (heated chemo bath that is delivered to your abdomen and soaks for up to 14 hours while patient is cut open) and 74 rounds of chemotherapy.  Not only does this amazing person not complain  he always manages to go to work  help his kids with homework and attend all three of his kid’s soccer games.  Traveling soccer entails up to 8 games a weekend in different parts of the state and out of state and it is something that he loves to do… spending time with his family. With everything Brian is going through he always makes everyone around him a priority.  If he knows you need help with something  he is the first person to jump in and offer help.  He is the most inspiring person you could ever meet  and has truly earned his nickname  Superman!The medical bills Brian has had throughout these past 5 years are crazy.  Nobody going through this should even have to think about that while fighting for his life.  We are all hoping and praying for a miracle to eradicate the cancer.  Please help reduce some of the burden on this wonderful family that is in this most unfortunate of circumstances."

After being admitted to the emergency room that night and eventually being transported to the Neurological ICU at the University of Rochester  Katherine’s doctors put her into a medically-induced coma to try to protect her brain from the continuous seizures she was having. Now  after more than three weeks  heavy anti-seizure medications have suppressed most of the seizures and she has finally started to wake up from her coma. Although still unsure of the cause of her illness  doctors believe that she has New-Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)  an extremely rare and poorly understood condition with limited research. As of yet  it is still unclear how long her recovery will take and it is likely that she will require weeks to months of rehabilitation to return to somewhat of a normal life. Katherine is a first generation college-student  born to two immigrant parents who have worked extremely hard to give her the opportunities she has had. She is incredibly committed both to her schoolwork and to building a more inclusive campus community  particularly for Asian-American students. She has a goofy  charismatic personality and spends as much time as possible snuggling cats  clearly her favorite animal. She has a beautiful voice and can be found singing along to the radio during any car trip she takes. She loves trying to be fit by going on hikes and runs  but when it comes down to it she really just likes eating shrimp crackers and watching scary movies. She’s confident  opinionated  and sticks to what she believes in  teaching and inspiring the people around her to be their best selves. It’s no surprise that Katherine came to Cornell to pursue a degree that will let her make a positive change in the future. Beyond anything though  Katherine supports her friends and family to whatever extent necessary  so it’s only fitting that we now return that support. Although she and her family have managed financially thus far  the medical bills that they’ll receive over the next few months are impossible for any family to handle  especially one already paying college tuition for both Katherine and her sister. Additionally  her placement at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester has made it difficult for her parents to visit Katherine while fulfilling their work obligations in New York City for jobs that are necessary for the family’s continued medical insurance. This insurance will cover some of the medical costs accrued during this process  but there will undoubtedly be significant costs that the family will have to pay out of pocket. Traveling to and from Rochester alone has already added up to a lot. We hope that we will be able to raise enough money to give her family a financial cushion as she comes out of the hospital to ensure that she can continue pursuing her personal and professional goals. Thank you for listening to Katherine’s story and we greatly appreciate anything you are able to donate. Find more information about NORSE here:  https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/new-onset-refractory-status-epilepticus-norse/Photo credit: Joshua Yam"

Having keen parental intuition  his parents began to pay attention and noticed a change in their son.  He threw up randomly a couple of times during the week  began to constantly feel tired and instead of fighting bath and bedtime like he normally would  he longed for it.  After Halloween he was demonstrating balance issues and that is when  Dean’s parents drove him straight to Nicklaus Children’s Hospital where he was later diagnosed.  The incredible staff there were able to intervene and drain most of the fluid causing all the pressure in little Dean’s head and alleviated some of the pain  but after getting the final pathology results back  Dean will begin radiation treatment to help shrink the tumor before adding other forms of treatment.  Please  let’s band together and help this family get the best care possible for Dean so can get back to being the incredible kid that he is.  Please know  that any unused money raised will be donated to pediatric cancer research because no child or parent should have to go through this.  Thank you for your kind donations  prayers and positive thoughts for Dean and his family.  #deanmachine"

Thinking we were dealingwith diverticulitis  I felt we needed to take Thierry to the ER at HoagNewport. After completing a series of scans  which came back withabnormalities all throughout the liver and colon  he was expedited with the procedures of endoscopy and colonoscopy. The results showed that he has a large mass at the end of his colon which they took a biopsy of and several other chest and stomach biopsy’s confirming that it was cancerous. Receiving this news was the most horrible moment of  our lives  the room shrunk  my heart sank and I could feel my legs about to give out.Shortly after  the doctor ordered a liver biopsy  which confirmed themost devastating news  Thierry was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroendocrine Carcinoma Cancer which started in the colon and metastasized to his liver.Tears  shock  terror  denial…. Thierry is 48  in great health  playing basketball almost every day for the last 30 years  how could this be happening?!Since our initial  6 day stay at Hoag  we met with a few differentoncologists until we found the right one we were comfortable with. He advised us of a treatment plan consisting of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The chemotherapy treatment plan is an intense 3 day IV infusion every 3 weeks consisting of 3-4 cycles with updated CT/PET scans every 2-3 cycles. On February 14th and 15th  Thierry completed his first two days of chemo. On February 16th Thierry went in to complete his 3rd day of the first round of chemo but was unable to because of his blood and liver levels were not  at safe levels to infuse chemo  and was admitted to the hospital again for another week.On February 21st  Thierry's birthday  we were advised of the main concern being the bilirubin number; this number is highly monitored and started to increase to a threatening level. On February 21st thedoctor informed us of two scenarios that may happen; that if hisnumbers continue to climb he would only have a few weeks. If thechemo worked  the number would peak and then come back down which is currently the situation he is experiencing. Thierry was discharged on February 24th with a  bilirubin number that peaked at 21.3. On February 28th Thierry was re-admitted due to extreme pain he had not experienced before  which I am told by a few different doctors is that this could be the cancer dying. His numbers were at 14.1.  Thierry was discharged on March 5th  with a bilirubin number of 11.9 (before chemo his number was 13.1).!! Our doctor was very pleased to hear of this and gave us the green light to commence chemotherapy again for March 6th. March 6th  Thierry started his second round. We are extremely positive of his fight. He is going to shatter all statistics and keepfight this battle!!We are told that this cancer is extremely rare and needs extensivechemotherapy and innovative treatments that are not available through regular medical channels and not all covered under health insurance. We are exploring all options including clinical trials and other types of immunotherapy. This is a rare cancer but Thierry is a rare human being  he is going to beat this! He continues to be positive and stronger than ever. As many of you know  Thierry lights up the room and is FULL OF LIFE. He is a beast on the court  and I assure you he is a beast beating this cancer ! Giving it his all ! We are requesting help ASAP to cover all aspects of his treatment and recovery.At this time  Thierry is focusing on healing and recovering. He will be unable to work for the next 3-6 months.  Thierry supports two households; myself-his wife  Colleen-his ex-wife   and our four children: his daughter  Katee 18 years old   two son’s: Matthew 17 years old  Ryan 21 months old and another baby boy on the way due to arrive in July.At this time  the whole family is stepping up to help support Thierrythe same way he always provided above and beyond for us. Katee is balancing two jobs to help make ends meet while attending college at Saddleback Junior College full time. Matthew just got his license and a vehicle and has been applying for jobs so he can work after high school. Colleen has downsized into a small apartment while working two jobs. I am 5 months pregnant  working full time   taking care of our 21-month-old alongside with Thierry. The cost of living and financial support will get tighter and tighter as he continues his treatments and follow up scans. It is very sad to go through this. To see a loved one who you know is stronger than most to take on a challenge as this is heart breaking.Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated. Everything we cando to help and surround him with love is most important so he canfocus on beating this monster. Please keep him in your prayers.

We are terrified  but find comfort in knowing there is no safer place be than in the sovereign and powerful hand of the Almighty God we have worshiped since childhood. I was reminded by a dear friend that God is not an instigator  but with His authority and power He uses trials to draw us nearer to Him  and allows us to depend on Him in situations that seem out of control. I am clinging to this now and will ask for faith to do so even when this path seems impossible to finish well. “Whatever my lot  thou has taught me to say  it is well  it is well with my soul.”-Friends and family would ask you to join us in supporting this wonderful family during this time of need.

Despite the pain and sorrow in the following weeks  the couple took comfort in celebrating the birth of their first child at the start of October. When it came time to deliver Lucas  Yumin eagerly caught his son and proudly held him for the first time  becoming a father in the wake of losing his own. It was indescribably beautiful and bittersweet.Soon after  Yumin began feeling more neck/back/chest pain than usual.  Shortly after  doctors found a small lump in his rib and after a battery of tests  CT scans  and a biopsy  doctors then found another lump near his lungs/heart. By the time Lucas was just 3 weeks old  Yumin was diagnosed with a rare  apparently aggressive form of cancer called thymic carcinoma. It is rare so there are not many accurate statistics about prognosis. Since they found cancer in his thymus gland  rib and lungs  this is extremely serious and life-threatening. As Yumin and Eileen face this battle together  especially as Eileen focuses on raising Lucas alone  we want to partner with them financially in this season to help them meet the high costs of part-time childcare as Eileen is forced to return to work  a specialized meal service for Yumin and other medical bills.If you know Yumin and Eileen  you know they are rooted in an unshakeable faith.

In September of 2016  we were given the news that the time had come to start exploring options and teams in regards to a lung transplant. After much research  we landed on Texas Children’s Hospital In Houston  Texas. Their pediatric lung transplant program is the best in the country with the highest success rate. We met with Dr. George Mallory and his team of doctors  surgeons and nurses for the first time in March of 2017. Kamaile went through a series of evaluations over the span of a week and would then be put in front of the medical review board for approval. Thankfully  at that time she had been deemed medically too well to be approved for transplant. So life went on and every 6 months since then  we have traveled to Houston for more evaluations to make sure Kamaile was well and to make sure she was ready (or not) to be listed.  Because with being approved for listing  it would mean relocating our family to Texas. For the next 12-15 months after that initial evaluation  Kamaile seemed to have a bit of a turn around. We had very minimal hospital stays  which meant a lot more time for her to do the things she normally couldn’t do. It was everything she needed....to be a normal teenager for once. If anyone knows Kamaile’s journey or knows anyone with cystic fibrosis  you know the toll it takes and the constant sacrifice given of themselves... just to be able to breathe. Dozens of daily medications   blood sugar checks  4 times a day breathing treatments that last for an hour or more. The amount of self care is endless. Fast forward to to the end of summer 2018. Since August  Kamaile has had 3 hospitalizations that have lasted 2-3 weeks at a time. For her 17th birthday  she was in the hospital. Unfortunately  IV medications have been the only thing that works at the moment  which entails hospital stays on Oahu. In November  we were called back to Houston for another evaluation. At the end of our time there  Dr. Mallory gave us his initial recommendation. It was time to relocate. By mid December  we got the official recommendation stating that  Kamaile had been approved by the TCH medical review board for transplant. On January 22nd  our family will be leaving Maui and relocating to Houston  Texas. As soon as we get there  Kamaile will undergo another evaluation and then be listed for a double lung transplant. Our time frame in Houston is unknown. The median wait time for a lung transplant at TCH is about 4-6 months. Although  there have been instances where patients have waited over a year for a donor. While we are there  Kamaile will be under the full care of Texas Children’s and Dr. Mallory and we will be anxiously waiting for the perfect donor for our baby girl. For now  we are savoring every moment we have left on Maui and Oahu with our friends and family. Our hope and prayer is that we will be back and Kamaile will be able to graduate with her class at Kamehameha Maui in May of 2020. Matthew  Kamaile  Nainoa and I appreciate everyone for the love  support and prayers you’ve sent our way over the years."

Meagan and Mike are both educators who just recently started new jobs in different counties in Georgia  bought a house  and moved.

Baby Lyla has multiple surgeries ahead and this beautiful little family needs our love and support now more than ever.  She's a tiny thing who came in at 5 pounds  4 ounces.  Its amazing to see the small miracles that God grants us - what a blessing! Your donation will help immediate medical bills.*************************************************************************************************************************************************************2/27/19 Update: Thank you all for your love  support and especially prayers for baby Lyla.  She is two months of God-given miracles disguised as sweet baby.Baby Lyla had her first heart surgery when she was less than a week old. Her first five weeks of life were spent in NICU and CICU at Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth  Texas.  When she finally came home she was on a three hour feeding schedule that took about one and a half hours to complete – 24 hours a day  seven days a week.  Needless to say parents and grandparents are beyond exhausted keeping up with this schedule.As we approach her two month birthday she’s headed back to Cook Children’s on Friday for the first of two procedures in preparation for a much more complex heart surgery.  These first two procedures are similar to an angioplasty.  In short  a balloon will be inserted into her aorta to expand a constricted area to increase blood flow.  This will be done twice in two separate procedures to hopefully buy time for baby Lyla to grow in size and strength for what lies ahead… Eventually Baby Lyla will need a second  more complex heart surgery to further repair her aorta and possibly her mitral valve inside her heart.  The timing of this is unknown at this time and dependent upon the success of the two procedures outlined above. As you can imagine the financial stress on the Pegram family is beyond compare.  Their health insurance is decent but we all were shocked when the first hospital bill showed up well over $600 000. Again – their insurance is covering much of that however both parents have dramatically cut back their work load as caring for baby Lyla requires a small army on a 24/7 schedule. How can you help?  There are two things that can continue to assist this young family.  If you’ve given previously – God bless you and thank you!  We consider you members of Team Lyla!  If you have the means and ability to give again then please feel free to do so as this young family needs your help now more than ever!  If you have $20 to spare please know it will go to a great cause and you too can be a part of Team Lyla.  However if life has blessed you with abundance and you want to make a difference then feel free to make a significant contribution.  Additionally – we need your continued prayers.  We’ve witnessed more miracles in the past two months than we deserve in a lifetime – and yet we need more.  We believe in miracles  we hope for miracles and we pray for more miracles.  Please know that your prayers and well-wishes have lifted us on the longest and roughest days.  Saying thank you just doesn’t seem enough… Become a member of Team Lyla and help make a difference.  I promise it will be the greatest thing you do all week!  Thank you and Go Team Lyla!"

In the summer of 2017 Kris went for her regular scheduled mammogram and let the technician know that she felt a lump that didn't feel quite right after.   After the report came back \"clear\" and she was told to come back in two years  she didn't question it until a few weeks later as Britt noticed it getting larger.  After being told a second time she was clear  they went to another doctor and were promptly told there was not just one lump but two.  The test revealed that she had Stage 2  aggressive  Triple Negative breast cancer.  they have spent 2017-2018 fighting breast cancer.  In 2018 Kris starting feeling not right and her appetite suddenly disappeared. Her symptoms got worse and worse and she ended up in the emergency room in October. During that emergency room visit it was found that her breast cancer had now spread to her liver and was quite advanced  with a 2.5 cm tumor and 6 cm tumor. She was diagnosed with terminal metastatic liver cancer. The doctor told her she has between 4 months to two years to live  closer to the shorter side due to how aggressive the cancer is. She was also told the cancer is inoperable  not treatable and incurable.Kris has been a fighter throughout her journey but now things have progressed and her cancer has been diagnosed as terminal.Upon hearing this news Kris’s wish is to move closer to her kids and grandchildren in Michigan. This move will allow Kris to spend time with her family and provide her with a warm circle of love to support her as she continues to fight this battle. In order to make this wish happen Britt  who is the sole source of income in their household  will have to leave his job. I am asking for your support and the support of our community to help make this wish a reality for Kris  Britt  and their family as they prepare for the worst and pray for the best.

Matt was in a dirt biking accident at the St. Anthony sand dunes that required him to be life flighted. And that’s all we knew  for our three-hour drive from Salt Lake City  to go see him. Turns out Matt had sustained a spinal chord injury after breaking his back. He had broken several ribs  collapsed his lungs  cut his liver  and broken an eye socket. On 9/22  we also received the greatest blessing  Matt was still alive.  It’s all I kept telling myself because a world without Matt is much more tragic than a world with Matt as a paraplegic. There I said it. It’s a hard word  a surprising one still to us. For someone who ski raced as a kid  skipped days of high school to shred the slopes  who was captain of the University of Utah wakeboard team  who is as comfortable on a dirt bike as he is breathing  who just purchased a snowmobile to expand his already extensive repertoire of activities  the loss of use of his legs is daunting. For Matt  a relentless weekend warrior  it means the loss of an identity.  But Matt is so much more than the things that he does. And as soon as he’s healed  much to his mother's dismay  he WILL get back out there and continue to \"send it\" (a term Matt uses meaning go for it).Those that know Matt  know he would never put something like a GoFund Me out there. Because he is selfless to the core. Through his positivity  his athleticism  his optimism  Matt has created a community with immense amounts of support and love. A community that wants to provide for Matt like he has always provided for us.  So for those of you that feel like helping  and may not know how  here is a place you can do it. In the meantime  keep Matt in your thoughts  in your prayers  and send him all the good vibes. I love you Matt Tychsen. We all love you.”Lisa Loomis: \"Both Tychsen and Loomis families  along with friends far and wide  are here to love and support Matt.

She was not relieved of the pain  but she finally had validation from a doctor that the pain was actually real! After months of pain and years of seeing doctors for what she was told were minor issues  she was finally diagnosed.  This came just shy of three weeks after the birth of her third child  Maxwell. While recovering from her C-section surgery  taking care of her beautiful 3 and 4 year old daughters (Isabella and Alexandra) as well as her new baby boy  she was told the pain that was supposed to “go away after the baby was born” was Colorectal Cancer!  Sadly  although this was an extreme shock to our entire family  she told us that she wasn’t actually surprised  but thankful that not another person would tell her to live with the pain she had been enduring. Deep down  Charlotte had known something was wrong  she just needed a doctor to see it for themselves to figure out what was actually wrong. From December 26th  her world began to spin into that of CT scans  biopsies  MRI’s and meetings after meetings with doctors and surgeons for second and third opinions.  Finally  after multiple tests had been completed and Charlotte had traveled across New England to meet with several doctors  Charlotte was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer.  As many of you may know  Stage 4 Cancer means the cancer has spread from it’s primary origin to another organ  or multiple organs  in the body. In Charlotte’s case  the cancer has spread from her Colon  to her liver and also her lungs.  As a family  we have been completely overwhelmed and more than touched by the outpour of people who want to help and support Charlotte.  So many of you have asked how you can help and support and although it’s a VERY tough thing for Charlotte to accept or ask for  she now needs your help.Charlotte has always been the angel in our family. She lives in this world touching so many people with her desire and love of giving.  She has always sacrificed herself for the betterment of the people around her. She is a silent giver  never wanting or needing recognition or even a thank you.  We want to be able to give her back what she has so seamlessly and willingly given to others. Charlotte and her wonderful and supportive husband Gaston  have all of a sudden found themselves in need of a significant amount of additional child care as she has started her journey  that will become even more necessary as she continues her Chemotherapy. They both have needed transportation care for her daughters and infant care both day and night for Maxwell which is adding a huge cost to their already increasing expenses.  We would love to help them defer these costs  and are asking for your help.We would also love to help not only with the care of Charlotte’s family  but to also help fund enjoyable family experiences as they embark on this Cancer journey.  Cancer has entered their life and is taking so much of their energy and resources. We want them to be able to enjoy every beautiful moment they have ‘in between the Cancer’ and would appreciate any help in funding that would enable her family to share special times together “away” from Cancer.As many of you know  if you are unable to support Charlotte and her family monetarily  there is a meal train to help provide meals during Charlotte’s treatment.  This has and will continue to be a massive help for Charlotte that she will continue to update as her diet needs change. She and her family very much appreciate the delicious meals that have been delivered the last few weeks.  Here is the Meal Train link below: https://www.TakeThemAMeal.com/KVTY2385Lastly  and most importantly  Charlotte would love that you join her in prayer. As many of you know Charlotte is a passionate member of the Baha’i Faith and Baha’i community in Portsmouth. Baha’u’llah  the founder of the Baha’i Faith has revealed special prayers for both spiritual and material healing and considers it our duty to use such prayers (in addition to medical treatment) and to put our trust in the all-sustaining and all-healing power of God.“Thy name is my healing  O my God  and remembrance of Thee is my remedy. Nearness to Thee is my hope  and love for Thee is my companion. Thy mercy to me is my healing and my succor in both this world and the world to come. Thou  verily  art the All-Bountiful  the All-Knowing  the All-Wise.”  ~Baha’u’llah~Charlotte began her first Chemotherapy treatment this week as a clinical trial patient with a skilled team at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston  Massachusetts.  We are so fortunate to be working with this wonderful and skilled team of professionals  and we are all positive and extremely hopeful for Charlotte as she starts this journey.We all thank you so much for your love  support and prayers.  We could not be on this journey without you. Please spread the word and keep the love strong.Love to you all Charlotte’s Sisters (Nikki  Dominique  Hannah) https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/charlottengarukiye/journal#4sistersstrong#chazstrong"

To his friends  Pete was known as a quick-witted and out going person to all those that were blessed to know him.  He was absolutely the life of the party  possessed a great sense of humor and was an incredibly talented cook.  He could often be found behind the grill or in the kitchen cooking up a delicious masterpiece for family and friends.  He had become an avid kayaker and cyclist and enjoyed long rides with friends and even competing in races.  Pete  Charity and the girls enjoyed traveling and making memories in different parts of the world.  He will be missed dearly.As devastating as a tragedy like this is  the last thing Charity should worry about is finances.  Our goal  as Charity and Pete’s friends  is to keep stress off of her plate so that she can focus on healing from their loss at this very difficult time.  We hope to help with final medical costs  educational cost for the girls  and any expenses related to the loss of income due to Pete’s untimely death.And while the loss of Pete can neither be compensated for nor his family’s grief taken away  we can all make a big difference in their lives by contributing toward this cause.  We are forever grateful for your generous contributions and for supporting the Marrone’s in this way.                                                                Sincerely  The Marrone’s tribe"

His infectious sense of humor  musical and poetic talents  incredible creativity  kind heart and fun-loving spirit bring so much joy and laughter into this world. This amazing man has been on the roller coaster of his life  and unfortunately  it's not the kind anyone wants to ride.  As you probably know  he's been battling cancer for a few years (including original bout in 2016 and his relapse this past year). While finally enjoying some relatively pain-free days in Florida on vacation  things changed quickly and he landed in the ER in Fort Myers on Tuesday  January 15th. They discovered a bowel perforation and he was whisked away to emergency surgery. Since then  he has been in the ICU and weathered many complications. As of Tuesday  February 12th he was transferred out of ICU and remains in the hospital in Fort Myers.Those of us who have the privilege and honor to know Lynn and Larry  know that they would never want to burden anyone or ask for help. But countless people have asked how to support him and his family during this difficult time. So  we've taken it upon ourselves to set up this page to raise some money to defer the cost of a medical flight to get Larry back home to St. Louis  Missouri (sorry Larry  the weather isn’t exactly warm and welcoming at the moment  but there’s no place like home). The flight is approximately $15 000 (his seat better include extra leg room and a complimentary drink!). Once back in St. Louis  the plan is for Larry to go to Evelyn House  a home for hospice patients. It's a lovely place  but there will most likely be a lot of cost incurred as his insurance may only cover some of the expenses.  Details are still being worked out but it could cost as much as $500/day for him to be there. Of course Lynn and their boys Pat  Paul and Charlie are totally focused on Larry and making sure his needs are covered. But we also know that they have spent a lot of money on unexpected expenses during the month he has been in the hospital in order to be with him as much as possible. They've had to rent condos and cars  and pay for lots of flights back and forth  all the while missing work. They wouldn’t have it any other way  but we want to ease the financial stress as much as possible. This fundraiser will provide peace of mind to the Eberles as they all return home with Larry  so they can continue providing him with all the support he needs. Not only will the money raised help with the medical flight and his ongoing care  but it will also allow for the mounting medical bills to be paid. And most of all  your monetary support will give peace of mind to Lynn and the boys while they remain strong by Larry's side every step of the way. Thank you for your ongoing support  love  prayers  thoughts  cards  and gifts. They are all very much appreciated by the Eberle family."

To put it bluntly  due to the never-ending and expensive treatments he has to endure  John and his loving wife Lynn have depleted their life savings. And they need OUR help. The family has set up a Go Fund Me campaign and are asking fans to help in any way they can. This is the man who gave a generation a window into the world of the fantastic and frightful. We owe him. To do our part  Full Moon has donated 30 copies of John's signature fantasy film TROLL on DVD to the family. Both John and producer Charles Band have signed the collector's item copies and  for a donation of $100 or more  fans and supporters can secure one of these limited editions. 100% of the proceeds go towards John's fight to survive.For many starting out in the movie business in the 80’s  John Carl Buechler was much more than the man who gave many of us our start. He was a hilarious and positive friend who believed in giving young people a chance  often keeping us on payroll even when he didn’t have work…and in some cases while we were still learning the craft itself.  His friendship  love and dedication has been unfaltering throughout the years to not only his friends  but to his family and fans.We are sad to report that John has recently been diagnosed with Stage IV prostate cancer and he and his family desperately need help.  For months John has quietly been trying every treatment he can to turn his situation around and in the process has not only exhausted his insurance  but his personal savings.  There is still a glimmer of hope that a miracle will occur  and that John’s situation will get better  but regardless his wife and family are about to be hit with thousands of dollars-worth of medical bills and lost wages  due to the fact they spend much of their time with John at the hospital. Every penny the family has is going to John’s care and comfort. The bottom line is we desperately need to raise money for his continued treatment.  This page is set up by John's wife as she needs all the support she can get.He is currently focusing on the best of both conventional and alternative medicine  as well as taking daily physical therapy. He is responding to his homeopathic treatment  but it’s an expensive process - all of this is tremendously taxing both physically and monetarily.Although it was tough making the decision to go public with his situation - it’s time for his friends  family and the horror community to come together to do everything possible to help make him more comfortable and hopefully get him on the road to recovery.  John is a fighter and insists on not giving up. It is his hope to turn his situation around and get back to work.  More importantly his family is his main priority and he is fighting ferociously to get better and have the chance to spend more time with them.We are raising 120k to pay off his past and much needed upcoming treatment bills.If you are a FX artist  who currently has a career because John gave you a shot. If you are fan  who has enjoyed John’s work throughout his expansive career. If you are friend who has ever laughed or loved with John. If you are a person who has compassion for people in pain and in need. Now is the time when you need to step up and help a terrific and decent human being and his family out.  EVERY SINGLE DONATION GOES TO HIS BILLS AND CARE. WITH LOVE  THANK YOU John’s Family and FriendsJohn Carl Buechler is a FX artist/director of many accomplishments.  A prolific motion picture director  having directed cult classics such as Troll and Friday the 13th VII.

At the age of 21  Ali Jafri had the highest of ambitions and the brightest of futures ahead of him. A joy for his friends and family  and a strong man of faith  Ali Jafri was bound to elevate those around him...until that fateful night. A car crash left him in a severe coma with minimal brain activity. A few days later  he succumbed to diffuse organ failure and was laid to rest. He was survived by his doting mother and father  Syed Jafri and Samina Jafri  and his younger siblings  Hasan and Zainab  who had never known a world without him.As the long days passed  the Jafri family held strong and endured the storm bravely. Zainab  now a junior in high school  knew her Ali Bhai would want nothing more than to see his sister achieve her dreams and continue to be the ace student that she was. She continued to excel in her classes with eyes set on the best colleges in the nation  all the while placating her healing family. In early June  just a few months after Ali’s passing  Zainab contracted the flu  except this was a flu like she had never had before. It lasted for days. Weeks. Zainab did not think much of it and continued to work towards excelling at her rigorous coursework. Her parents  however  decided it would be best to take her to the doctor. A day before she saw the doctor  Zainab became a finalist in a prestigious scholarship for her future college education.At the doctor’s office  Zainab and her family were greeted with looks of concern. They were told that there were some serious abnormalities within the lab work and that they would need to go downtown for further check up. On an ambulance  Zainab was taken immediately to Texas Children’s Hospital.There  she was taken to a very specialized ward  a ward for patients with leukemia. Zainab’s lab abnormalities were concerning for leukemia.After a prolonged hospitalization that required lumbar punctures and bone marrow biopsies  Zainab was officially diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Thankfully  while being one of the forms of leukemia with the best long-term prognosis  it still carries a long treatment regimen and short-term complications. With the devastating events of November 2017  and now this long and arduous battle with cancer  the Jafri family has had no room to think about the rigors of normal life. There hasn’t been much time to leave the hospital  let alone go to work. Zainab has been out of school for the past year  putting her dreams on hold. However  being the fighter and optimist that she is  Zainab sees this experience as one that has given her strength and inspiration. She is now an aspiring oncologist. Let’s do what we can to ease this wonderful family’s burden. The proceeds are directly funded to Zainab’s brother and father  Mohammad Jafri and Syed Jafri.#resilientZainab"

Ed suffered a massive stroke on June 27  2018 and was admitted to the Neurological ICU at Northwell Manhasset Hospital. With his family and close friends by his side 24/7  Ed improved slightly every day. Ed’s strength and fortitude  coupled with love and support from family and friends  enabled him to be transferred to the Glen Cove Traumatic Brain Injury Unit  where he was treated by a most supportive Glen Cove Hospital staff. Ed was then moved to Sub-Acute Stern Rehab  finally returning home on October 31  2018  spending four months away from home after his stroke.  Ed and Elizabeth have been lifelong residents of Glen Cove  and they will be celebrating their 25th Anniversary this month. They adore both of their daughters - Samantha  who is a Senior at Georgetown University  and Meghan  who  is a Freshman at Fordham University. Needless to say  having their children moving onto campus in August was quite an emotional time for the Smith Family. Ed has positively impacted many lives within the Glen Cove Community  teaching music at Landing and Connolly Elementary Schools. He has taught students in fourth grade and fifth grade  laying the groundwork for incredible and exceptional musicians  in the Glen Cove Community and beyond. Ed has provided free lessons  countless hours  and energy to many within our community  and he has always been a kind and dedicated teacher in the Glen Cove School District for more than 26 years. So many people want to know how they can help. As of today  Ed has right-sided hemiparesis  which is partial paralysis on the right side of his body. At this time  Ed is unable to care for himself. He is unable to walk on his own and needs assistance with activities of daily living.  Elizabeth has been beside him every day in the hospital since the beginning  from early am to late pm  advocating on his behalf and is a constant support to further his recovery. Ed’s recovery over the next few months will be a marathon; not a sprint. The out-of-pocket costs to meet his current needs  ongoing care  medical bills  costs for the adjustments for mobility  and daily therapies will be an immense on ongoing expense for some time. Asking for help is never easy! The Smith Family has undergone unimaginable trauma  and the stress and daily challenges they face are immense. Please donate to Ed’s “Go Fund Me” page- any amount is greatly appreciated.  I  on behalf of the Smith family  have set up this “Go Fund Me” page as a fundraiser for Ed and his family. All donations are directly deposited to The Smith’s bank account  on behalf of Ed  to support his medical needs. Ed  Elizabeth  Samantha  and Meghan would like to publicly acknowledge the overwhelming outreach  love  and support from family  friends  colleagues  students  and the Glen Cove Community who have supported them in a million different ways. They are also sending a heartfelt ‘thank you’ to those generous enough to donate to this site.  Whether or not you’re able to make a donation  please consider sharing this page to those near and dear to you  so we can maximize our efforts in helping the Smith Family.  http://www.gofundme.com/ed-smith-recovery Please continue to pray for Ed’s recovery.Thank you  in advance  for your love and support Karen S."

This is a developmental disease in which the right bottom part of his heart never grew  therefore  he has no way of getting blood flow from his heart to his lungs.        In his short time on earth  Ayden has had many surgeries to try to fix this condition  first being when he was 4 days old. He has since been placed on life support (ECMO) after a near-death recovery from his first operation in which he was brought back to life via CPR. He is currently stable on a device called the Berlin heart machine. This device is a miracle in itself as it has subsided Ayden's heart attacks that were previously caused by normal functions like peeing  coughing and crying.          To date  Ayden is 5 weeks old and currently stable while he awaits a heart transplant at a reputable P.I.C.U. In New York City.  My son is listed at the highest possible level on the donor list due to his condition. This journey has not been easy but to date  I've been able to stay by Ayden's side now for 5 continuous weeks only leaving for my own doctors' appointments. I cannot thank my fellow officers at the NYPD enough for the support that they've provided during this time  it has truly made a world of difference.             I will have to stay out of work a while  until after Ayden's heart transplant  but unfortunately  the medical bills to pay for Ayden's survival continue to mount. Ayden has received a total of 4 open heart surgeries since he was born in late November and has lived his entire life within the walls of various ICU's. Money raised will be used for following:1.     Healthcare Expenses2.     Rehabilitation Expenses3.     Monthly Expenses as Naja will not be able to work for at least 6 months to one yearWe also request all of you to pray for Ayden’s speedy recovery. Thank you very much.With love Naja & Anesky Francis.Ayden's mom and dadWe would like to thank the following charities that have to date  been a saving grace and have reaffirmed our faith in community.

During a performance  while backstage attempting to relight a live fire prop  the container of flammable liquid ignited. In her attempt to control the flames she was engulfed and suffered severe burns. She was rushed to nearest hospital which  thankfully  was NYPB- one of the best for burn trauma. Sammy has 1st  2nd & 3rd degree burns across 38% of her body. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and doctor’s estimate she will have to remain there for 2 months of recovery to include multiple surgeries and skin grafts. Those who know her well know she has been a professional dancer for nearly 15 years. Fire has been a part of her dancing and her performances for about 9 years. So  it naturally came as a shock to many of us to hear this happened. Between the recovery and physical therapies  the doctors say it should be about a year before she can resume her dancing career. The road to recovery will require lots of time and effort from the entire family and even some of our closest friends. Being an entertainer has been my sister’s entire world. We created this GoFundMe with the hopes to help her financially during these difficult times. We thank you all for your contributions and most of all your prayers and well wishes.

It’s a rare form of soft tissue cancer in his leg called Myxoid Liposarcoma that is very hard to diagnose. Because of this  the tumor has had time to grow. The surgical team has concluded that in order to remove the entire tumor and ensure that Mikey will live  his left leg must be amputated on October 31st. Furthermore  to ensure that no cancer remains in his body  he will have to have chemotherapy once he recovers from the leg amputation surgery. The amount and intensity of the chemotherapy regimen will depend on just how aggressive the tumor tissue proves to be  which will be determined when the tumor is extracted on the 31st. The oncology team has informed us that Mikey might need inpatient chemotherapy for several months  which will make returning to work difficult if not impossible for an unknown amount of time.It’s a sad and frustrating thing that in this extraordinarily challenging time Mikey and his partner Cj must also contend with the financial reality of these treatments  recovery and adaptation to life after an amputation. We are asking that you donate what you can to help us raise $50 000 to cover the following costs:Medical bills:         • Any medical expenses not covered by Medi-Cal         • Physical therapy equipmentMobility Assistance: Medi-Cal only covers 80% of approved devices and costs range from $5 000 to $50 000 and these need to be repaired every 2-5 years         • Prosthetic legs (Different activities require different types)         • Wheelchair          • Travel to and from               • chemotherapy treatments               • surgery                • follow up appointments               • prosthesis fittings               • physical therapyLoss of income: basic needs will still need to be paid for during Mikey’s recovery. California Disability does not cover income loss for this type of amputation.         • Groceries         • Rent         • Bills Alterations to their existing space to make it more accessible for Mikey post-op or moving expenses to a more accessible home.         • Chair lift         • HandrailsModified Recreational Equipment: Mikey has always been an active guy and we intend to get him back to all of his normal activities as soon as possible but that will require specialty equipment.

UPS is rarely seen by oncologists in their practices and with a 70% survival rate.  Due to the rarity of his sarcoma  is imperative that Kevin has access to a multidisciplinary center that sees and treats a high number of such cases annually as this is associated with better outcomes.Kevin currently has Kaiser insurance  not renowned for specializing in  UPS.  His best approach is to get a second opinion about the best course of treatment.   Due to the severity of his condition  he will likely need to complete  his treatment outside of Kaiser (going out of network will mean he will need to cover all costs out of pocket).  Kevin will use this fund to obtain a second out-of network opinion provided by the Northern California institutions which have expertise in treating this rare sarcoma and the limb-sparing surgical procedure which will be required to fully remove the tumor from his leg: e.g.   UCSF and Stanford in NoCal or otherwise   Sloan Kettering in New York.  We are already busy reaching out to recommended doctors at these institutions (there are few specialists in this area).  If you  or anyone you know  specializes in soft tissue sarcoma in an extremity please be in touch.Please consider contributing to his fund  sharing photos with Kevin or this page  with others"

My name is Becky Thomason Humbert and Mardie is one of my lifelong closest friends! As most of you know  Mardie has been given more than her fair share of loss and challenges these past three years. Most recently she has been dealt an unusually cruel blow. On March 15th  Mardie was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer - in her left breast  lymph nodes  and bones. Mardie had her first round of chemo on Monday  March 18th and she will have chemo every 3 weeks for a total of 6 rounds. After the chemo she will have to have a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery.Mardie is a fighter and the strongest person I know. These past several years  that strength has been challenged in unimaginable ways. She has dealt with these challenges and deep losses with grace  love and a quiet strength that has floored those around her. Mardie is a nurturer and caretaker by nature...and a worker.  She got her first job when she was 10 years old painting addresses on curbs. She loves her work and is very passionate about the amazing experiences she has had working in the film/tv industry in many different capacities over the past 25 years and is looking forward to getting back to it as soon as possible.I know this will not shock you....Mardie’s biggest concern right now is how her diagnosis is affecting the people who care about her. She loves raising a village and supporting her community. I have no doubt we all have a story of Mardie being there for us in our darkest moments or brightening a day with her contagious smile and beautiful blue eyes. It is now our turn to repay the favor and lift Mardie  Dale  Edie and Becky up. Since her diagnosis  my phone has blown up with many people asking what they can do to help. And honestly  helping to eliminate some of the financial burden would take some of the stress off of the situation.  Mardie has a long road ahead of her - one she is prepared to fight and win  but the reality is she has to use all of her strength for this battle.My hope is that by creating this fund  it will allow Mardie and her family to focus their energy on healing her. Despite being in a Union and having good insurance  medical bills are already piling up and she will be unable to work while she is going through treatment. The funds will be used towards medical and cost of living expenses incurred while Mardie is unable to work. If we can lift some of the financial burden from them  I think that would alleviate some of the stress.“There ain’t no party like a Mardie Party  and a Mardie Party don’t stop!” To help me get the word out  you can share my link to your Facebook timeline.

The journey to recovery will be long  however Barry is a fighter with strong faith  and knowing his spinal cord was not severed gives hope that he will continue improving.  One of his near-term goals is to be able to participate in a program called Project Walk in order to gain the strength to ski again.  Project Walk is an intense exercise-based training program with state-of-the-art technology to increase mobility in clients with spinal cord injuries.  The facility is located in Stratham  NH and isn’t covered by insurance.  A one-hour session costs approximately $110.00 - $150.00.  We are hoping that the Lemire community will come together to give this gift and support Barry’s goal for Project Walk  as well as offset the cost of household changes that he needs for wheelchair accessibility in his home.  Since the accident  the Lemire family have received an outpouring of love  prayers  and encouragement. They are positive  faithful  and immensely grateful for all of the support from family and friends.Barry  Susan  Matthew and Amanda thank you and ask that you continue to pray for healing and restoration. “Be joyful in hope  patient in affliction  and faithful in prayer.” (Romans 12:12)"

Sherry lives in Brooklyn  New York  and works as a freelance hairdresser in film and television.  As a freelancer  she moves from project to project and does not have regular employment.  If a freelancer is unable to work  she does not get paid.   As a result of medical costs thus far  Sherry’s savings are depleted.  Additionally  we anticipate that she will not be able to work for several months following the surgery while she heals and undergoes further treatments.  While we are confident that her attitude and health knowledge will lead her to a full recovery  she needs time to rest and heal and this means time away from work.  We are seeking financial donations so that Sherry can pay for rent  utilities  food and further medical costs while she is recovering after surgery.  Knowing that her bills are paid and that she is not in danger of losing her apartment will be a big weight off of her mind and will allow her to focus her energy on healing.  The decision to make this request was not made easily  but it is necessary at this point.  Sherry thanks you  deeply  for any support you can offer.  Sherry’s health care proxy is her ex-husband  Jason Eldridge.  You can reach Jason at 646-319-8458 or jweldridge@gmail.com.  He will be in contact with the doctors during and after the surgery.  Alesha Oak will also be helping out and fielding emails.  Her email address is aleshaoak@gmail.com."

Her life has been filled with dancing  drawing  books  riding her bike and scooter  playing with her little sister  and exploring nature with her family. Then  the unimaginable happened. ￼￼￼The day after Thanksgiving  her sixth birthday  Nora caught the sniffles. Her cold progressed unremarkably with a fever and lots of coughing over the weekend. By Tuesday she was mostly well  but complained that her leg \"felt funny.\" On Wednesday night  she awoke  unable to walk  her left leg paralyzed. She was taken to the ER and admitted to the hospital that night; by the next day she had lost movement in her right leg as well. You may have read news stories about the rare and mystifying illness that is causing paralysis in kids  acute flaccid myelitis  (AFM)  a rare  polio-like condition that affects the body’s nervous system  specifically the spinal cord. Nora's parents and grandparents were terrified to learn that AFM had caused her paralysis. There have only been 300-400 cases of AFM in the U.S. in the last five years  and its precise cause is not yet understood. No treatment has been found to be effective in averting the destruction. The effects of the disease on other children have varied  as has recovery  but we are hopeful and are betting on Nora's youth and tenacity to get every gain possible. From the time she was tiny we've said of Nora that she's the \"hardest trier\" we know.While in the hospital  Nora will be engaged in intensive physical therapy and occupational therapy (regaining independence in as many tasks of daily life as possible). Nora has been brave facing the fear and pain of these therapies  and she is making gains. After she is discharged from the hospital  she will need prolonged physical therapy as an outpatient for no less than a year and continuing as long as it helps her to improve her quality of life.Nora and her family are in their third week in the hospital and the realities of the future are beginning to come to light. The unimaginable has happened to them  and the emotional and physical toll is staggering. Many have asked how they can help  and so we are setting up this fund to allow Emily and Austin to focus on what is critical right now—caring for their girls and meeting Nora’s needs today and going forward. The family is fortunate to have health insurance  but the co-pays and other costs will be far beyond their means. The family’s current apartment is not handicap accessible. We don’t yet know what Nora will need to aid her mobility or what additional accommodations  equipment  transportation  etc. the family will need to provide for Nora's return home and ongoing care.￼￼￼Nora is curious  imaginative  playful  funny  and sometimes feisty. Her lion cub strength and determination have helped her brave the discomforts and indignities of her affliction and hospitalization  and we believe they'll help her push past the boundaries of her new disability. In the hospital  instead of saying “I can’t do it ” we hear Nora say  \"Trying  it’s not working.” The difference is huge. Nora has not lost spirit  and neither will we. She has always been a unique and surprising child  and we can’t wait for her to surprise her doctors  therapists  teachers  and friends by showing us all what she can do.Thank you so much for your love  concern  and generosity.  ROAR!!"

His headache was so bad that he had to go to the hospital. Dave is a hard-working husband who enjoys his job taking care of our Earth as a geologist  as well as taking care of his home and wife  my good friend Cailin. She also works long hours as a store manager and horse trainer (a fellow equestrian). It’s not uncommon for Cailin to refer to Dave sincerely as “the most amazing human.”Days after Thanksgiving  Dave had emergency surgery to take out a brain tumor. The diagnosis was expected weeks later. Anxiety and depression filled their lives. Three weeks later  he rapidly lost control of the left side of his body  and once again he was rushed to the hospital. An emergency craniotomy was necessary to drain excess fluid that was putting pressure on his brain.Dave’s diagnosis was a very aggressive brain tumor called Glioblastoma (GBM): a grade four  quickly growing and spreading tumor. He is now on medical leave from his job. In the coming weeks  he will be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment  which his doctors hope will buy him more time. Cailin knows that now is her time to take care of Dave and that this will require her to dramatically reduce the amount she works. Dave is in his early 30’s— a vibrant  young and otherwise healthy man! Experts at Cedars-Sinai as well as The American Brain Tumor Association agree that additional treatments  such as participation in clinical trials  at his age can contribute to an improved prognosis.Both Cailin and Dave have touched the lives of so many people with their kindness  good spirits and generosity. Now  with your help  we can make it a little less stressful for them  so that they can share their time together with a little less weight on their shoulders  and so that Dave will be able to receive the best treatment available to give him the best possible quality of life. These cancer treatments are costly and are often not fully covered by health insurance.As many of us in the horse world know all too well  things happen that we cannot predict. A sudden fall can leave us wounded  emotionally and physically. In these times  a leg up is sometimes necessary to get back in the saddle; to help us keep enduring  even when the going gets tough.Please  join me now and donate whatever you feel you are able.

This event is changing life in dramatic ways for him  his loving wife  Teri  and his son  Reno. This page has been created to help them all with such things as medical bills  as well as physical  occupational  and mental therapies that will continue for quite some time. Carl will also need modifications to his home and a prosthetic leg so we can get him back out on the sidelines and being the amazing inspiration that he is.      This is not the first life threatening event for Carl  Teri  and Reno. But Carl is a survivor. Earlier in his life  Carl made a career as a player for the Canadian Olympic soccer team  and in the former Major Indoor Soccer League for the New York Arrows and St. Louis Steamers. However  a near fatal fall over 30 years ago changed Carl’s life and ended his playing career. The fall caused him to have brain surgery and left him with partially impaired vision and hearing. It took him some time to recover  but he overcame all obstacles with hard work  determination  lovefor life  family  and his passion for the beautiful game of soccer.  He was no longer able to perform at the level heonce did and began to focus on sharing his love for the game as a coach with many youth organizations over the next few decades in St. Louis and Springfield  Missouri. Some of these include Busch SC  Springfield SC  and finally his own club  The Carl Rose Soccer Academy. Through this new perspective of the game he has been able to teach young players the basic skills  teamwork  and heart that it takes to develop into not only great players but well rounded individuals both on and off the field.     The battle with sepsis was a fight that came on quickly in the winter of 2019. The blood infection in his lower right leg was caught in time to save his life  but the same could not be said for his leg. Over the course of eight days he had three separate surgeries that resulted in the amputation to his right leg just below the knee. With the direction of a great medical team  Carl spent a month in the hospital and rehab facility at Cox in Springfield. It has been a rough stretch  but through it all Carl has had a positive attitude and his faith has never been stronger.     His family  friends  past  current  and future players need to see this positive influence back on the pitch spreading his knowledge and passion with all.  Better yet  we want to see him running up and down the sidelines. This man is not going to let anything stop him from doing what he loves.  Being a caring father  husband  and leader."

I personally can attest to this as I am a leukemia cancer survivor  and I understand that no matter who it is and what cancer is attacking a person’s body  this journey can be painful. Breast Cancer seems to be a cancer that attacks a woman’s body  heart and emotions with little warning.Most of us have been touched by cancer through someone we know  and when it’s someone who has made a great impact on your life  it’s even harder to watch them go through it.Yolanda Pratt is that special person who has made a life changing difference in my life as well as hundreds of others! Yolanda and her husband Ron are Missionaries in Alaska. Their Suicide Prevention work is making a powerful difference in and outside of Alaska as many of you know.  Cancer has a way of dominating a persons time and their personal resources. And I’m passionate about asking you to join me in giving their life back to them!Current Condition Yolanda was diagnosed with Breast Cancer spring of 2016 and went through the process of surgery removing two tumors and 29 lymph nodes. Her healthy diet was helpful in keeping the cancer in remission until August of 2018  when a medical investigation for a pain in her hip area revealed the cancer had returned with vengeance. The cancer has moved to several locations in her hip bones  lower back  sternum  lungs and a large tumor in her left sacroiliac joint. And the prognoses for Yolanda is disheartening to say the least. The small fraction of survival rates given to her for this stage four cancer treatment by conventional methods was simply not an option  so Yolanda did her homework and looked elsewhere.  There Is Hope!Thanks to a wonderful connection through some friends  Yolanda and Ron recently made a quick trip to Nevada where they had a meeting with Dr. Forsythe  MD  HMD. A pioneer and leader in Integrative Therapies and wellness medicine. Dr. Forsythe has successfully helped save the lives of thousands of cancer patients. As a certified Oncologist and Homeopathic Doctor  his innovative treatment has accurately assigned the right approach to fight the cancer on a cellular level. With the highest recorded success rate in this field  there is great hope for survival and quality of life. Although the Pratt’s believe that ultimately God is their divine healer  Yolanda is stepping through this open door of care  a treatment not offered in Alaska and having no medical insurance they are praying the costs will be covered.- Initial Treatments- Followup Integrative Treatments- Travel & Lodging   - Blood Work & Tests- Prescribed Supplements and MedicationsTotal $107 000.00  This many digits can be overwhelming for one family  but with the help from people like you  we can help Yolanda get her life back!Making less then $40 000 annual income as missionaries  they are still suffering financially from the costs accrued over the last two years. Besides the overwhelming medical costs that maxed out their credit cards  raising a special needs son adds to the challenges when dad takes mom away for treatments.                                          You Can Help!The world needs more people like this  people who have devoted their lives to others. For over thirty years these two have helped others  given to others  sacrificed for the needs of others and raised untold amounts of money for others!And now we have the chance to help them.  THE GOAL IS $107 000This need is URGENT as Yolanda can’t start this treatment on Nov 12th without the Funds!

My brother  Sean O’Donoghue  who is 21 years young  was born with 8 major heart defects. His first open-heart surgery was when he was 4 months old. His first Heart Transplant was at the age 4! He lives life to the fullest  is a great golfer  and an amazing person who inspires people. All who know him personally  know of him or are just hearing his name  know how great of a person he is  how kind his soul is and how passionate he is about living his life to the fullest. His many passions include watching (and betting on) football and everything about the Green Bay Packers. Unfortunately  Sean went into heart failure  and rejection in January of 2015 during one of his high school’s Golf matches. Ever since then  our road has become more bumpy with lots of twists and turns. He needs a second heart transplant and has been on the UNOS list since May of 2015. During the past couple years his team of amazing doctor’s have done what they could to keep him stable and home  but on September 21  2018 Sean crashed. He was admitted to the Cardiac ICU at UCLA. He has been living there since then and will continue to live there until he receives that life-saving  donated heart. His new home away from “home”.The past couple weeks Sean has declined even further. He has a lot of fluid around his lungs  abdomen  pericardial effusion  swelling and of course his heart is stiff. His own body has developed antibodies to fight his own heart. Because of that they now have him on Plasmapheresis treatments and chemotherapy among the already plethora of other medications  IV’s  drips  pills  etc. He’s so very complicated and fragile.

My name is Dave Hassett. And I was proud to work with Amy Banks for almost 20 years in Eden High School's Counseling Office. Amy died suddenly on Thursday  December 27th.She was a shining light for all of us who work in Eden. Through her constant and loving example  Amy made all of us - counselors  social workers  school psychologists  teachers & administrators - strive to do better in our efforts to help Eden's students and families. Amy constantly put aside her own needs to make time to help every student  parent & family that asked for her assistance. Phone calls home  arranging doctor's appointments  giving rides  providing clothing  hugs and encouragement. Her student's needs always came first. Amy was also was an expert at empowering young women. She helped countless girls find meaningful and confident paths in their relationships and post-High School education and careers.And these were the caring actions that Amy performed on her *typical days.* Amy Banks literally redefined in the small community of Eden  NY what it means to be a \"School Counselor.\"She regularly sacrificed her own time as a mom to three active boys  as a loving wife to Ronnie and as a member of a huge  loving family from Angola & South Buffalo in order to give and give and GIVE her time and energy to others. If you were lucky enough to know her you loved her. And you understand that this world has lost one if its brightest lights and most caring souls. Please consider making a donation on behalf of the help that Amy gave to others. If you are reading this I am positive that Amy helped *you* in some way. She certainly helped me in a way I will never  ever forget: when my wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer in June  2017  Amy took over most of my job responsibilities at school in order for me to be with my wife during her last months on earth. I do not know of many people in the world who would sacrifice their own time and energy to help another as much as Amy did for me  my daughter and my late wife Alicia.Please help Amy's family now. Ronnie cannot stand that we are doing this. He won't ask for help. So we are doing what Amy would do: giving him help anyway.Because as we all know: Amy's husband and her boys deserve our support. She gave her selfless support to all of us for so many years. It is right that we give something back to her wonderful family in her honor.God Bless you  Amy Banks. And your entire family. You will forever live on in the stories that are told about your loving heart and soul."

Angiosarcoma is a rare and clinically highly variable cancer of blood vessels (a form of sarcoma). His is a high grade (aggressive) angiosarcoma which could have started anywhere in the body. The most common place for angiosarcomas to arise is in the head and neck area  breast (frequently several years after radiation and surgery for breast cancer)  bone  or other vital organs such as liver and spleen. Sarcoma is a rare cancer in adults (1% of all adult cancers)  but rather prevalent in children (about 20% of all childhood cancers). It is made up of many “subtypes” because it can arise from a variety of tissue structures (nerves  muscles  joints  bone  fat  blood vessels – collectively referred to as the body’s “connective tissues”). Because these tissues are found everywhere on the body  Sarcomas can arise anywhere. Thus  within each site of the more “common” cancers there is the occasional surprise sarcoma diagnosis (e.g.  breast sarcoma  stomach sarcoma  lung sarcoma  ovarian sarcoma  etc.). Angiosarcoma is one of the many “subtypes” of sarcoma. Garrett has decided to forgo conventional treatment (such as chemotherapy) and is instead  doing alternative holistic treatments. Thus far  all treatments are being paid for out of pocket by him and his family  as most insurance companies don’t cover alternative medical treatments  which are quite expensive. Garrett’s mom  Cinde Perales has been keeping up with all the financials over the last several months."

While the doctors are optimistic about her prognosis  the road that lies ahead will be long and not without significant physical  emotional and financial challenges.Ellie  her mom  dad and 8 month old brother Cole  are facing significant medical bills as a family that won’t end once the month-long inpatient hospital stay is over; maintenance chemotherapy treatments  follow up appointments with specialists and physical and emotional recovery will extend for years as Ellie will need to remain cancer free for the next five years to finally be “cured.”On behalf of the family  donations of any amount are graciously being accepted and will be used entirely to help Ellie win this fight against Leukemia - From all of us  thank you."

For Kylie  this means her ribs and spine have disappeared or fractured in multiple places. This resulted in a spinal cord injury and paralysis from the waist down. In recent months  Kylie has been through a number of surgeries to repair the damage and is receiving the only known medication for GSD to slow bone loss and potentially regenerate some of the bone.The good news is  Kylie is receiving care for this rare condition and she is being monitored by specialists on both coasts who are studying the disease. She recently moved back with her parents to get support with day-to-day activities  wound care  and visits to doctors in Los Angeles.The bad news is  none of the care outside of the hospital is covered by insurance. Both small things (specialized medical transport) and big (in-home care to provide basic movement  medical and hygiene assistance) are expenses that will be handled entirely out of pocket.Kylie has the support of her family – her parents are retired educators and have been there every step of the way. But our hope is that Kylie and her family can continue the recovery process with a little help from us to lessen the burden of the soaring financial costs required to keep her safe and comfortable. All of the money collected through this GoFundMe will be given to the Wilson family to offset the costs of in-home care assistance – simple activities such as helping to get Kylie in and out of bed  the bathroom  the medical van  etc. can be monumentally challenging with the physical damage caused by GSD.

We are asking for your generous help and for your financial support. Eight years of showing up to fight brain cancer comes with a cost and they have admirably paid that bill with fortitude and grit. This year has been particularly tough on Jason’s prognosis and medical bills are mounting. Let’s come together as a community to make sure Jason and Julie have all that they need to pay their bills and feed their souls so that their reserved energy is used squarely and substantively for the betterment of Jason’s health (for an abridged summary of his battle with cancer  see below).A few weeks ago Jason went in for his 5th surgery so the doctors could drain the water from his brain  drain a cyst that had formed  and take out and test any cancerous material they came across. Walking  talking  eating  and getting around are all difficult for Jason and he needs constant care and supervision. Julie is happily doing this but also working to provide for their needs for survival. All of this journey has been met with love  wit and humor from Jason and Julie. (Take a gander at his blog btw  and see for yourself. I’ll post the link below.) They are the first to help anyone and everyone in need. They are the real deal in this complicated world and two of the best friends this writer has ever had. We ask that you help out in any way you can. Donate money. Forward this page. Post on social media. Anything and everything is appreciated.Jason’s irreverent brain:In 2010  right smack in the holiday season  tests revealed an aggressively malignant tumor  the size of a lemon  cradling Jason’s brain. Brain surgeries 1 and 2 scraped the mass out and away from it’s point of origin  the cerebellum. Good thing is  between chemo  radiation and the invasive operations  the tumor was eradicated... as was much of Jason’s coordination. This all took place mere weeks after Jason had passed the California Bar Exam to become a lawyer. Needless to say  Julie and Jason became a one income household.Countless MRI’s led to 6 years of a cancer free head for Jason until  in the early summer of 2016 a small tumor was found near the same place in Jason’s brain. Another surgery  more chemo and radiation  and a year on a trial drug did reduce the growth in size to a mere dot  but did not completely eliminate it.For 2 years  the “dot” persisted. Then earlier this year (2018) another dot formed and so Jason endured yet another surgery (4 if you’re keeping track) and went on a new infusion drug. And that takes us up to last month.Every dollar goes directly towards Jason's recovery.Jason’s blog for insights on his journey and his musings on all other things... http://www.smorgasbored.com"

The good news was that they might have figured out what was wrong with Jayden  but the bad news was that they needed to transport him to Children's Hospital LA right away. On the way back to SBCH  mom Googled “high levels of ammonia in newborns ” and the results were not good. Most were case studies of infants that were seemingly normal and healthy at birth  went home  but within the first few days of life exhibited symptoms similar to Jayden’s  but without a quick diagnosis  the result was almost always death.Highly elevated levels of ammonia in the blood  a hyperammonemia crisis  is extremely toxic to the central nervous system  usually resulting in brain injury  coma  or death. Upon arriving at CHLA  Jayden's ammonia level was in the 300s. A normal level for a newborn is less than 20. After initial tests  IV medication treatment was started. It did not work--after the 4 hour treatment and re-test  Jayden's ammonia level had risen to 500+. Doctors immediately decided to treat Jayden with hemodialysis. They were unable to get the required catheter in Jayden  so surgeons had parents sign a consent for them to take Jayden to the operating room to use their tools and methods to insert the catheter. The team returned Jayden with the catheter in his shoulder  instead of the desired jugular or femoral position. Nurses started hemodialysis  however it did not work. Doctors explained that it was because Jayden was too small and the catheter was too large; it simply wouldn’t work. After several failed attempts  Jayden's ammonia level had risen to the 1500s  a huge hit to his brain.It was early morning the next day--mom and dad had not slept nor eaten. It all seemed like a delirious  horrific  terrifying nightmare. Jayden’s little body was unresponsive  he was hooked up to several IVs  he had a breathing tube  and blindfold for the bililight (jaundice). He was breathing hard and foaming at the tube. It was heartbreaking to see.Next  a doctor performed Peritoneal Dialysis. It involved inserting a catheter in Jayden's belly  periodically pushing in fluid which would attract the ammonia  then flushing it out. Throughout the day Jayden’s ammonia level fluctuated up and down  between 700-900s.Mom and dad watched fireworks over downtown LA from the hospital window  wished Jayden happy new year  and went to sleep (mom slept bedside and dad slept in the parent lounge). Around 1am  the doctors came to speak with mom. They discussed how the peritoneal dialysis didn’t seem to be working. They could continue the treatment through the morning  but if it doesn’t work  there wasn’t much more that they could do; most newborns don’t make it  and if they do survive the hyperammonemia  their prognosis wasn’t good. Mom went to wake dad  and the two of them took a long walk around the empty quiet hospital  discussing their possible future of a family life after the death of their newborn.The next morning  new years day  the nurse reported that his ammonia levels had been steadily declining by 100-200 each blood draw; he was already down to the 500s. Slowly but surely  Jayden’s ammonia levels continued to decline. When it went down to around the 100s  Jayden started to become more responsive! He squirmed and pushed back when doctors poked him  and finally  he opened his little eyes!It was truly a miracle; Jayden's strength  and friends' and families' love and prayers helped him survive the hyperammonemia crisis. Bringing his toxic ammonia level from the 1500s down to the 10s! Over the next several weeks  Jayden became more and more alert  as doctors worked to create a formula that would allow him to eat through a tube in his nose to the stomach. Genetics dieticians keep tweaking the formula to find the perfect balance between maximum protein for Jayden to grow his body and brain  without elevating his ammonia level too high. Jayden then had to practice eating from a bottle  as therapists feared he forgot how to swallow  or  that the hyperammonemia effected his brain development and his muscles would not be able to coordinate to eat on his own. Amazing Jayden proved them wrong and is now eating full bottles  and even pulled out his NG tube one morning.                                                                                                                    Because Urea Cycle Disorders are inherited genetic disorders and untreatable  it is a lifelong disorder for Jayden involving medications to remove ammonia  and a careful low-protein diet. Unfortunately any stressors or if Jayden gets sick  he could get fatally sick and would need to go to the ER to avoid additional brain-damaging hyperammonemia crises. Therefore  to cure his UCD  Jayden is now in discussions for a liver transplant. He is in the evaluation process  and soon to be listed for transplant.Jayden and parents have been in the NICCU at CHLA for over a month now. Parents had been sleeping on the couch next to Jayden's bedside for a month  but is now staying at the Ronald McDonald House behind the hospital. They go back to Camarillo once a week now (after the crisis) to spend a day with their daughter  take a shower  and do laundry. 4-year-old Gigi had been so excited and preparing to be a great big sister  but has not seen Jayden since he was two days old because she is not allowed in the NICCU at CHLA. She is staying with her grandparents in Camarillo; everyday she says she misses her mom and dad and little brother. She also is not attending her preschool so she misses her teachers and friends. Gigi is staying strong and is very understanding that little brother needs mom and dad  despite having her daily life routine disrupted. On top of medical and relocation costs while at CHLA  the family still has to pay rent and utilities for their home and small business studio space  childcare for Gigi  and other daily living expenses. They are on their planned maternity/paternity leave so they do not have to be at work  but they are not getting full salaries during this time. They've also had to cancel the classes they teach and their annual production at the dance and martial arts studio they own in order to be with Jayden in LA.Everyone let's get together and help Jayden continue to get the care he needs  including the liver transplant  and help the family worry less about financials are continue to stay strong for him. Any donation big or small is appreciated. Even just love and prayers. There is so much love surrounding Jayden  he truly is blessed."

Toni’s contagious smile can make even the bluest person feel happy again  and her love for her family is unmatched. Toni  sometimes known as Antoinette Shapiro Contino has a deep love for life. Even the most negative things have a positive spin in her eyes. With everything that she does  she puts in a hundred percent of her time and love. There is only one thing that goes above all else  and that’s her family. Her husband Robbie of twenty-five years and her four children are the light of her life and anything they need will always go above her own wants. Family outings are planned around their sports tournaments rather than  vacations   work is put on hold so she can be there for their tournaments and games. She’s been there for every birthday  and these kids deserve to see another one of hers. With a heart of gold  you may know Toni from Ronald McDonald house or one of the many charities she donates her time to. Or maybe you know her from school events or dining at Mitch & Toni's where she made everyone feel at home. Maybe you’ve passed her at sports games and only know her by how loudly and proudly she cheers for her kids. Maybe this go fund me is the first time you get to know her. It doesn’t matter where or how  her passion and her deep love for people is clear. Her life is beautiful and warm and loving; her life deserves a long and happy end. Things took a turn for the worst about three years ago. Due to landlord increases  they lost the restaurant. As much as she would miss Mitch & Toni's  the people who dined there would miss her even more. Luckily  she landed on her feet at a wonderful restaurant group in the city. It seemed as though things were going to be okay and then it was taken away yet again when her knee gave out. Surgery was immediate and afterward  she could no longer do the work that she loved so dearly. Fibromyalgia made every day a little harder and the lack of work put a terrible strain on the family and the bills that went unpaid. While she suffered  she still managed to prevail. She was finally stable  but her family wasn’t. Three weeks ago  the worst happened. Her oldest son  at only 19 years old was home for the holiday break when he was diagnosed with Chiari malformation. They scheduled him for Brain Surgery in the Spring . Just five days later  while her head was still reeling over her son  she received a call that her routine mammogram showed invasive Breast cancer. The last two weeks have been packed to the brim with visits to surgeons & oncologists. There was simply no way she could go back to work with everything going on. Her surgery is scheduled to happen two weeks from now. For all of those who love her  seeing this happen to a wonderful woman is utterly heartbreaking. This is why we lovingly started this go fund me to assist with all of the medical bills from the Knee surgery  her upcoming surgery  any other bills that come with making sure this cancer is gone and the anticipated brain surgery for her son. Toni is blessed to have so many people love and care about her. Our  hope is that we can all come together-Family & Friends   to celebrate her \"Healthy\" 50th Birthday in July ."

"Medical","February 17, 2019","HLH Awareness for Gary Connor","$44,055","$100,000","369","1","385","714","LANOKAHARBOR","NJ","We are starting this GoFundMe page to raise awareness on HLH and to help Gary Connor through this difficult journey he is still currently battling.              On October 14th 2018  Gary woke up with flu-like symptoms (High-Grade Fevers of 103  lack of appetite  body aches  chills  and overall just fatigued).  After 2 days of these symptoms he went to a local urgent care center  where he was told that he needed to go to the Emergency Room.  His urine was a very dark brown color which is a sign that he was severely dehydrated.  His girlfriend  Jessica  rushed him to a Community Hospital in Toms River  both thinking that he just needed to be hooked up to an IV pole for some fluids and maybe some antibiotics.  That day was the day that changed his life forever.  They first tested him for the Flu and Strep  both of those results were negative. Then they ran some more blood work that came back and showed very elevated numbers which implied that he was fighting a “very serious infection” as the doctor put it.  They admitted him that day and said that he should expect to be there for at least 3 days.  Gary being the hard worker that he has always been  wasn’t very pleased to hear that he would be missing that many days of work.  After 4 days of an extensive number of tests that were done  all with negative results  and a decline in his overall health resulting in him having to be intubated  the family decided it would be best to transfer him to Robert Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick  NJ.                When he arrived at RWJ on the 21st  the doctors continued to run more tests including a Lumbar puncture in hopes that it would come back with something that would tell us what was going on.  Nothing remarkable was ever shown.  He experienced multiple organ failure which led him to be put on dialysis for his Kidneys along with a bunch of other medications to help with his other organs.  He broke out in rashes all over his body  was still experiencing high-grade fevers  and now was sedated in order to prevent his organs from over working themselves. The family worried about his mental health being that he was extremely sedated.  Every day they gave Gary a “Holiday” in which they would lower the sedation to wake him up for 15 mins. In that small amount of time  Gary’s family and Jess  would talk to him and tell him to stay strong and to keep fighting. The kids missed him and needed him.  On Oct. 24th  they removed the breathing tube  but 6 hours later  they had to reintubate him. A few days later  the doctors finally decided to do a bone marrow on him.  They quickly looked at the blood under a microscope and saw the Microphages (type of cells in your body) eating the other cells indicating that he was suffering from what the doctors believed  was a rare disease called HLH. Doctors said they were 50% sure that it was HLH but had to wait for the testing results to be conclusive. They recommended that we should start the protocol (treatment) for it which is a chemo called Etoposide  and a high dose steroid which he was already on.  After much consideration  the family decided to go ahead with that treatment in hopes that this would help save Gary. On the 31st  we received the results that it was indeed HLH. Therefore  Gary needed to continue with Chemo.              On Nov 3rd  they removed the breathing tube and just a few days later moved us out of the ICU onto the oncology floor.  Things started to look up from there  but he had days in between that would make you question it.  He experienced a mini stroke  multiple mucus plugs in his lungs  extremely high blood pressure  a high heartrate  multiple blood transfusions  and suffered from multiple infections in his lungs and blood stream. We were all thankful that he was still with us and that we could spend time with him on Thanksgiving. We were hoping that maybe he would be back home in time for Christmas but on Dec 3rd  he was reintubated and taken back down to the ICU. He went through multiple organ failure for a second time  fluid buildup around his lungs  and continued to suffer from multiple infections all due to him not having any white blood cells from having to undergo chemo treatments.  Doctors weren’t hopeful anymore but that didn’t stop us from fighting.  Gary was in desperate need of platelets  so we started a blood drive to help him out. Doctors decided that it was best to hold off on chemo because his body couldn’t handle any more.               A few weeks later  he did what doctors weren’t expecting and his numbers started to get better  he started developing more white blood cells and platelets that he desperately needed. HE WAS NOT GIVING UP!!!  On Jan 1st 2019  they removed the breathing  feeding  and chest tubes. They moved him up to the oncology floor just a few days later where he currently still is to this day. He has lost all the muscles in his body  so he receives Physical Therapy every day to relearn and regain those muscles.  Doctors did more testing to find out more about his HLH condition which showed that he didn’t have cancerous cells and that this was considered “Secondary HLH”.  The next steps for Gary are to figure out what caused his HLH to flare  continue receiving intensive amounts of PT to help him learn how to sit and walk again  and practice daily exercises to help him learn how to eat again.              Gary is one of the most hard-working people you will ever meet.  All his life  it revolved around working and working hard to provide for his family in order to give them the best life possible.  He is a loving father to two children; Alexis Connor  who is 18 years old and Ryan Connor  who is 15 years old.  Gary is the children’s main provider so with him being away for the last 4 months  they had to adjust to the changes that were happening. It is so sad to say that Gary spent and missed out on several holidays with the kids and family  along with missing most of his daughter’s final year and his son’s first year of high school.  As his daughter and family  we miss having the “life of the party” around.  It’s too quiet and we need him back. We are asking for your donations to help with his medical bills he is receiving and to help him so that he can continue getting the care he so desperately needs. Any donations are very much appreciated. Lastly  a special thank you and shout out to his girlfriend  Jessica Soares  for being by Gary’s side through this rough journey and never leaving his side. We appreciate and love you so much.  We love you Dad – Keep fighting and pushing for us – YOU GOT THIS!! Many doctors have never experienced having a patient with HLH so please make yourselves aware of this disease and the treatment for it  links are below: https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/h/hlh/about  https://hemonc.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis  https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis-hlh"

Eleanor lights up any room she enters with her smile and ability to see everything life throws at her with the \"glass is half full\" attitude. Unfortunately  her cancer returned in December of 2016 causing her to start chemotherapy treatments again. In December 2018   Eleanor was told the cancer had spread to her liver and she is in physical pain.  Consultations with a hematologist took place a few weeks ago and after more blood tests  her oncologist told her there is not much more the doctors can do for her. One way we can support Eleanor through this challenging time is to ease some of her financial burdens. We hope to raise $50 000 to help defray her related expenses so she can focus on spending time with her family and allow Henry  her husband  to afford to take unpaid family leave so he can be with Eleanor and care for her. Please help us spread the word.

Over the last few weeks  she’s undergone a barrage of diagnostic tests to see if and how far the cancer has spread in her body  but unfortunately  most have come back inconclusive.  Her care team has decided that they need to “treat now  ask questions later” and proceed with surgery as soon as possible. She will be undergoing surgery for a partial gastrectomy the first week of April  during which they will remove the affected part of her stomach and surrounding lymph nodes and tissue. During surgery they will be able to explore and biopsy the other potentially affected areas in her body to determine if further treatment will be needed after the operation.Colleen is an Alcuin “lifer” and started as a student in 1983.  She began working in the classroom in 1998 and has been there off and on ever since!  Her family is an Alcuin legacy - her mom  Rene Jantzi  was a teacher there for 35 years and her son  Nova has been there since seventeen months old.  Colleen has cared for countless children over the years and now it’s our turn to help care for her.If you know Colleen  you know she’s always ready to fight the good fight – whether it’s on behalf of a child  a loved one  or even an animal.  This time she’s fighting on her own behalf and she needs our help and support.

This family is in a battle right now and many have reached out to ask how they can help in addition to prayers. I wanted to create a place for that kind of support as I know moving forward  this family will be faced with many difficult decisions and a need for resources. Kaema was admitted to the hospital last week on March 6th and suffered two ruptured brain aneurysms. This happened while she is 23 weeks carrying her first baby. She remains in a coma but is fighting hard to protect her baby boy and allowing him to grow stronger. I love my family and we are so incredibly grateful for the outpouring of love  support and prayers that have come our way. Below is a message John shared on his Facebook page about what has happened to Kaema. “It is with much sadness that I share Kaema Schenck suffered a brain aneurysm on Wednesday evening and is now in a coma.  She underwent brain surgery on Thursday afternoon and the doctors were able to clamp the aneurysm.  Unfortunately  the damage caused by the initial rupture was devastating and the doctors do not believe she will survive.  Our 23 week unborn son is ok at the moment and Kaema is fighting to keep him safe.  Kaema’s medical situation has fluctuated to every extreme over the last 36 hours  but she never stopped breathing and through it all our baby’s condition and vitals remained stable.  Kaema’s instincts for motherhood are on level with a grizzly.  There is no doubt in my mind  Kaema is in a fight to the death to give our son the best possible shot at life.  Every extra day Kaema gives our son increases his chances at a healthy start to life.Kaema and I were at home when she had her aneurysm.  It was a very hectic few minutes of us trying to figure out what was wrong.  In the middle of all the chaos and adrenaline  Kaema looked me in the eye  and with clear words said  “I’m so sorry that I’m scaring everyone.” Those were her final words before losing consciousness.  Because of the look she gave me in that moment  I know two things: 1) Kaema knew exactly what she was saying and 2) I now understand that she also knew in that instant precisely what was happening to her.  Those who know Kaema will not be surprised to learn that in the face of a life and death crisis  with chaos and danger at extremes  and with only a fleeting moment to communicate a message  Kaema’s only concern was for everyone else and not herself.Kaema is currently in the ICU and continuing to fight.  She has had people from all around the world praying for her over the last couple of days.  Thank you to everyone for all of the thoughts  prayers  well-wishes and good energy transmitted over the last two days  please keep them coming.  I would like to especially thank the nurses  doctors  staff  helicopter pilots and crew at St. David’s Medical Center and St. David’s North Austin for your tireless efforts.  You are helping us in our moment of greatest need and we are eternally grateful.”"

She and my mom bonded immediately  and one day Hope told Lucia  \"You are my mom.\"   The truth of Hope’s words energized Mom to work through whatever channels possible to ensure Hope's safety. It took two and a half years  but Hope and her almost-two-year-old daughter Rosie were granted asylum in the US.  They arrived in Anchorage  Alaska  where my mom had just started a job at the Alaska Native Medical Center.  My brothers and I got a sister and a niece  and couldn't have been happier.  But two months later there was bad news to go with the good: our mom has an aggressive strain of breast cancer.   Lucia can't work  and her disability insurance will cover only 25% of her income.  This makes money very tight for reasons I'll break down below. 1.)  She was a midwife for 20 years. The work she longed to do with refugees required an MD  so when she was 49 she went to medical school.  Her debt from that is still enormous  and because she's not 100% incapacitated by the cancer (i.e.  because she can still walk) many student loans (at high interest rates) cannot be deferred.2.)  Hope was injured in the attack that killed her family  and needs medical care  including surgeries  as a result.  Rosie also has significant special needs  unforeseen until they arrived in the US.  Many agencies and helpers are being marshalled to meet those needs. 3.)  On-the-ground care:  Mom and Hope and Rosie live together  but they need support -- cooking  cleaning  transport  tutoring for Hope  long-term work with Rosie to move her along etc.  Mom says they need Mary Poppins. Your contributions will help us to find her—or a workable team of helpers. 4.)  Cancer treatments:  Mom has some genetic conditions which make conventional cancer treatments potentially dangerous for her.  Soon  she'll be flying out of state for a regimen using European protocols.  At best  insurance will offer partial coverage.  She will need periodic follow-up care for the next year at least  possibly more. Lucia’s  salary would have taken care of all of this.  But 25% of it won't.  She needs major help  and soon.  I've banded together with some of her closest and oldest friends to create this platform and start the process.  Mom is selfless to a fault.  (Literally.  Sometimes it's super irritating.)  She fought long and hard against this campaign: her friends overrode her.  The idea of asking for money  and for this much  utterly mortifies her.  But she needs it  which is why we are asking for your help.   What I didn't mention is that Hope  prior to meeting our mom  and before her father was killed  vowed to him that she would  become a lawyer.  Her suffering has brought the dream more sharply into focus: she now wants to become an international human rights lawyer working to protect women and girls from what she endured.  With Mom's support we're positive she can do it.  But to support Hope we need to support Lucia.  Any amount you can give is appreciated more than you can know."

Any amount you can donate helps us greatly!!!My name is Daniel Janequine. I am husband to Katia and the proud father of Gabriela  an 11 year old 6th grader. Since mid-September 2018  I started to accumulate between 6 to 8 liters of liquid in my belly that I have to have pumped out on a weekly basis. After two agonizing months going to multiple doctors and being admitted a few times to the Dr. Phillips Hospital in Orlando  the doctors still couldn’t find the cause of this liquid retention. Finally  at the end of November  around Thanksgiving  my gastroenterologist referred me to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville  2 hours and 15 minutes from Orlando  where they would find out in 5 days the cause of this liquid retention and the side effects. I was diagnosed with a very rare disease  that only 1 in a million people around the world have  called Syndrome of Budd-Chiaris. Syndrome of Budd-Chiaris is a hereditary vascular disease where the liver can’t properly function and  in my case  the only treatment solution is to do a full liver transplant. Since December 2018 I have been going through a series of exams and evaluations at Mayo Clinic  so they can put my name in the liver transplant list. As the breadwinner in my household  I’ve decided with the support of my wife and daughter to start a campaign to collect funds to help our family minimize the financial burden associated with my condition. I have been gratefully employed by Chase Bank for over 6 years and I have health insurance and a short-term disability plan that is covering my medical and living expenses for now. I have not been able to work since November and will run out of my short-term disability insurance in May 2019  when I’ll be left without an income. On top of this  I have additional expenses since I have to travel to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville on a weekly basis  sometimes having to stay in a hotel there for extended periods of time. Once I am officially put on the liver transplant list  I’ll have to be ready to get the call that a liver is available to me at any time. Once I receive the call  I have to immediately travel to Jacksonville for the surgery. At that point I’ll have to get a hotel or rent an AirBnB for at least two and half months. I’ll be at the hospital for a few weeks and then we have to stay near the hospital until the doctors give me the OK to go home. My wife Katia is my full-time caretaker. She’s the one taking me to all my doctor’s appointments and procedures in Jacksonville and helping me with my medication and special diet. She’ll also have to be with me during my recovery time in Jacksonville after the transplant and at home once we are back. Katia is an excellent realtor  but unfortunately during this difficult time she’ll have very limited time to work which will also negatively affect our family’s income once I run out of my short-term disability insurance. I am asking family  friends  businesses and organizations to help me during this difficult time where I can’t fully provide for my family. The funds I am requesting here will help us offset the travel and lodging costs we are accumulating and will need after the surgery. Hopefully I’ll get a transplant before I run out of my short-term disability insurance and can recover in a timely manner to get back to work without getting into much debt. I intend to keep everyone posted of my progress here. I would like to ask everyone for your prayers  positive thoughts and good energy to  be send my way. The sooner I have the transplant and recover  the sooner I can get back to work and to my normal life. I appreciate and thank you in advance for your donation and for your participation.   God bless you all!!Best wishes  Daniel  Katia and Gabriela."

Allen es un niño de 4 años que sufre de un cancer llamado \"Neuroblastoma\"  este cancer afecta aproximadamente a 800 niños anualmente en los Estados Unidos  lamentablemente Allen es uno de esos casos. Siempre fue un niño saludable  jugueton y muy cariñoso  pero a sus cortos 2 añitos de edad fue dignosticado y todo lo que el conocia cambio. En el 2016 necesito una cirugía de emergencia donde le sacaron el riñón izquierdo junto con un tumor que estaba creciendo en el mismo pero esa fue la mejor opción que encontraron los doctores para poder salvarle la vida y comenzar a tratar el cancer con diferentes tipos de tratamientos comenzando con muchas quimioterapias las cuales le daban mucho vomito  diarrea  dolores en su cuerpecito  provoco que todo su sistema inmunológico se suprimiera y necesitaras numerosas transfusiones de sangre y plaquetas y muchas inyecciones para ayudar a sus sistema inmunológico a recuperarse  necesito muchos dias de ingreso en el hospital y el no entendía que pasaba y solo pedía que pararan de hacerle cosas malas y lo dejaran regresar a su casa donde el se sentía seguro. Necesito 2 transplantes de células madres donde cada transplante llevaba mas quimioterapias aun mas fuertes que las que la que ya había recibido y de las cuales la única forma de recuperarse era poniéndole el transplante y esto llevaba un aproximado de 1 mes ingresado por cada transplante. Necesito 20 radiaciones las cuales fueron todas con anestesia porque el miedo no le permitía quedarse tranquilo durante el procedimiento. Luego comenzamos la inmunoterapia que fueron 6 ciclos todos en Terapia Intensiva debido al riesgo que tiene el tratamiento  los dolores eran muy fuerte y tenia que estar en Morfina por 18-22 horas diarias para poder soportarlo.  Apezar de todo esto Allen nunca se dio por vencido y siempre ha luchado como un super héroe que es  cuando sale del hospital quiere jugar  ir al parque  pasear como si no tuviese nada pero debido a su enfermedad no puede hacer esas cosas muchas veces. Cuando pensábamos que todo estaba bien comenzó a tener dificultad para ir al baño y es cuando le descubrieron una masa nueva  necesito otra cirugía para extirparla y a solo 4 semanas de operado en un CT de seguimiento le encontraron una 3ra masa completamente nueva y de rápido crecimiento  lamentablemente aquí en Miami ya no hay nada que hacer por el  ahora tiene que viajar a New York para recibir un tratamiento experimental que confiamos que lo ayude a estar finalmente sano. Debido a todo esto es muy difícil para su familia estar en el hospital dandole la atención que necesita y trabajar al mismo tiempo para cubrir todos los gastos de la casa mensualmente.  Esta pagina se hizo con la esperanza de poder recaudar fondos para que su familia pueda dedicarse a el 100% y ayudar con su viaje a New York ya que va a ser un camino largo y de mucho tiempo viajando entre New York y Miami  asi su mama  su hermanita y su papa puedan compartir mas tiempo con el y no tengan que preocuparse por cosas como Renta  carros  telefono  luz   agua  etc. Todo el dinero recaudado va a ser para ellos para que puedan pasar este mal tiempo un poco mas desahogados y por lo menos con la tranquilidad de que Allen va a tener una casa adonde regresar y va a poder recibir todo su tratamiento en New York sin ninguna demora.  Gracias a todos por sus donaciones y pidan por la sanacion de Allen y de todos los niños que tienen que pasar por esta tan mala enfermedad.GraciasCarlos de DiosGood morning  my name is Carlos de Dios and I am Allen Gutierrez's grandfather. Allen is a 4 year old boy who suffers from a cancer called \"Neuroblastoma\"  this cancer affects approximately 800 children annually in the United States  unfortunately Allen is one of those cases. He was always a healthy  playful and very affectionate child  but when he was 2 year old he was diagnosed and everything he knew changed. In 2016 he needed an emergency surgery where they removed the left kidney along with a tumor that was growing in it  but  that was the best option found by doctors to save his live and start treating the  cancer with different types of treatments  starting with many chemotherapies which gave him a lot of vomit  diarrhea  pains in his little body  caused his whole immune system to be suppressed and needed numerous blood transfusions and platelets and many injections to help the immune system recover  he stayed in the hospital for many days and he did not understood what was happening and he only asked to stop doing bad things and let him return to his house where he felt safe. He need 2 stem cell transplants where each transplant carried more chemotherapies even stronger than the ones he had already received and from which the only way to recover was to received the transplant  this took about 1 month admitted for each transplant. He needed 20 radiations which were all under anesthesia because the fear did not allow him to remain calm during the procedure. Then we started the immunotherapy that were 6 cycles in intensive care because of the risk of the treatment  the pain were very strong and had to be in Morphine for 18-22 hours a day to be able to take it. Despite of all this Allen never gave up and has always fought like the superhero he is  when he leaves the hospital he wants to play  go to the park  walk as if he had nothing but because of his illness he can not do those things many times . When we thought that everything was fine he started to have difficulty going to the bathroom and that's when doctors discovered a new mass  he needed another surgery to remove it and just 4 weeks after surgery in a follow-up CT he found a 3rd mass completely new and fast growing   unfortunately here in Miami there is nothing to do for him  now he has to travel to New York to receive an experimental treatment that we hope will help him to finally be healthy. Due to all this it is very difficult for his family to be in the hospital giving him the attention he need and working at the same time to cover all the expenses of the house monthly. This page was made with the hope of raising funds so his family can dedicate 100%  to him and help with his trip to New York as it will be a long road and to many traveling between New York and Miami  that way mom  little sister and dad can share more time with him and stop worrying about things like rent  cars  phone  electricity  water  etc. All the money raised will be for them so that they can spend this bad time a little more relaxed and at least with the peace of mind that Allen will have a house to return to and will be able to receive all his treatment in New York without any delay. Thank you all for your donations and ask for the healing of Allen and all the children who have to go through this bad illness.Thank you Carlos de Dios"

Now  let’s back up a little. The BackstoryAs you may know  Eric and I were high school sweethearts. We found each other again later in life  creating one big  crazy blended family with our six children (each bringing three from previous marriages).You might also know that Eric has been sick for a long time and needs a liver transplant. Eric’s health challenges began in 2006 when he was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a rare  progressive and incurable autoimmune disease of the bile ducts. Eric has undergone many surgeries and hospitalizations  including the complete removal of his colon due to cancer in 2014  and the placement of a stent in his liver in 2017.In April 2018  Eric’s illness put him in the hospital yet again with acute cholangitis and septic shock. In May 2018  he was placed on the liver transplant list at the University of Minnesota once his doctors knew that every other available treatment had been exhausted.Amid blood infections  extreme fatigue  nausea  fevers  insomnia and other debilitating symptoms  Eric remains so positive. He is incredibly appreciative of his friends and family and continues to work when he’s not hospitalized.Living Donor Liver Transplant (LDLT)Learning that a transplant from a live liver donor was possible for Eric’s condition was a huge ray of hope. The reality is that Eric would likely die waiting on the transplant list if it weren’t for this option (this is the case for 40 percent of people in Eric’s condition). I was tested in the summer of 2018  but my liver isn’t large enough. Eric’s son Cole turned 21 (the minimum age to be considered a donor) and immediately signed up to be tested in January of 2019.  After many weeks of testing  Cole was approved. Eric’s entire liver will be removed and replaced by a portion of Cole’s healthy liver. Amazingly  the liver is the only organ that can regenerate  so eventually both Cole and Eric will have livers of normal size.Eric is so incredibly humbled by this generous act being done so willingly by his eldest son! The living donor liver transplant (LDLT) surgery is scheduled for Wednesday  April 17  and should last between 8-10 hours. Eric will remain in the hospital for three weeks to two months  and Cole’s expected hospital stay is 10 days. The CostsNow for the less-than-great news. The fear of medical complications is only one of the stresses our family faces. The average cost of a liver transplant in the U.S. is $575 000. The cost of anti- rejection medication is estimated to be $5 000-7 000 per month for the first year. While we are grateful to have health insurance  there are many expenses related to the surgery that will not be covered. The loss of income will be the most challenging for our family  as Eric is expected to be unable to work for 6-12 months following the transplant. I will also be unable to work for a time while I take care of Eric  and Cole will be out of work for 6-12 weeks as he recovers too.This journey has already put a financial strain on the family. Ultimately  we need to raise $85 000 to help our family get through the next year.How you can helpAll funds donated will be used for family necessities during the recovery time when Eric can’t work (mortgage payments  utilities  groceries  medicine  etc.)  as well as all expenses related to Cole’s care and recovery (including travel expenses for follow up appointments).Any funds left over will be donated to the University of Minnesota Health Transplant Care to help other families enduring this same struggle. If you’d prefer to donate by cash or check  you can mail a donation to P.O. Box 206  Victoria  MN 55386.We are beyond grateful for your encouragement and support. We also ask that if you have not already  consider becoming an organ donor. So many people die waiting for a transplant  and this small act gives more people like our family hope for themselves and their loved ones.With incredible gratitude Kathy Wischmann and the entire Wischmann familyTo learn more visit the sites below:Information on Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis University of Minnesota’s Liver Transplant Center   Caring Bridge  Wild Fans Eric and Cole in 2000The Wischmann FamilyKathy's kids- the Mock family"

Her brother Craig died at a year old from liver cancer and her brother David died at age 17 from heart disease while playing basketball. Who would ever believe that tragedy would strike the Jones family again? In 2012  Lisa discovered a lump in her breast just two months after a negative mammogram. She was quickly diagnosed with stage 2B Breast Cancer. After surgery  and several rounds of chemotherapy  she thankfully rang the bell at Hershey Medical Center announcing that she was cured. While being treated for her cancer  Lisa acquired a love for running and completed numerous races with some of her biggest supporters as part of the Scranton running community.   She ran numerous races in Scranton  Philly  Hershey  Virginia Beach and her biggest accomplishment  the New York City Marathon with Ryan’s Run 6! All being a testament to her strength and endurance. Lisa continued to live her life cancer free enjoying her home  her children  her job  her family and friends and her time in Long Beach Island. Lisa was not aware that the mental strength and endurance she was gaining through marathon training was actually preparing her for the struggle of her life. Two months after she ran the New York City Marathon in 2015  her cancer metastasized to her liver and she was diagnosed stage IV/end stage cancer. This was a crushing blow to Lisa  her family and her friends. This new diagnosis brought Lisa to The University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia where she has endured daunting chemo treatments  some of which had side effects that were extremely harsh to her body. Medical procedures became common place. Not one to complain  Lisa continued to work full time and take care of her home and family. Two years ago  Lisa was admitted to the University of Penn for an extremely life-threatening bile duct blockage due to her cancer. Her condition was critical and her family and friends feared that she would not make it home. Lisa’s strength astounded her doctors and it appeared that a miracle occurred as she fully recovered and returned to her teaching position where she has shaped the lives of hundreds of students over the last two decades. After her recovery from the bile duct illness  Lisa acquired malignant peritoneal ascites which requires weekly treatment that continues to this day. In November of 2018  Lisa was hospitalized with a nonsurgical bowel blockage which became a critical illness as she lay in a coma for four days in ICU. It was  indeed  another miracle that she survived and came home after a month in the hospital. Lisa was sent home in December with the unfortunate expectations that she would not survive more than a few weeks. As we put this Go Fund Me page together  Lisa is thriving and with the help of her family and friends and the miracle of medicine. She has regained much of her strength and is learning to deal with the effects of the disease. She requires daily assistance for medications  tube feedings and nursing care. Chemo options have been exhausted. Lisa is unable to work and is currently on a medical sabbatical. There currently are copays  uncovered medical expenses  and ambulance fees that are mounting daily.  The expenses of daily living  raising 2 teenagers and maintaining a mortgage continue.  Her Mom and Dad have placed their lives on hold to help Lisa and her girls meet their daily needs. Through all this  Lisa continues to spread awareness about Metastatic Breast Cancer. She  like Robin Roberts  is trying to make  ‘her mess her message’. She takes every opportunity to educate everyone about the realities of breast cancer. She is role model  not only to her girls but to her community and the world. She often ends her musings on her FB page  HOPE…#LisaStrong   with the following hashtags:#bethelight#stageivneedsmore#knowledgeispower Her family and friends have rallied to support this warrior whom we love dearly!!  Please consider making a contribution to this fund that will help defray expenses.  Share Lisa’s story   which while heartbreaking  is also filled with love  faith  strength and hope!Strength and Love Lisa’s family"

We remember him circling our worksheets in red pen  or good-humoredly chiding us  as fidgety kids  to focus on our work.Some of us know him because he organized math and science competitions across Vigo County and Indiana state middle schools and high schools. He volunteered countless hours to coaching  preparing his students for competition at the state and national level. MathCounts  Science Bowl  Science Olympiad— he did it all.He was also a longtime math and computer science professor at Indiana State University  where he was known for teaching difficult courses  but being truly invested in his students’ achievement. As a student review notes  “One of the best math teachers I’ve ever had… Restored my confidence in being able to do well in math.”He taught thousands of students over twenty years  of all ages and levels. In 2002  he received the Presidential Scholar Teacher Recognition Award from Vice President Dick Cheney.He was stern but kind; he held us to a high standard because he believed all students were capable. He gave his time freely; he believed us  in our ability to learn and to do well as students and in life— and now it is time for us to believe in him. What Happened To Dr. ChiDr. Chi recently retired  and was excited to welcome his first grandchild.On July 9th  2018  Dr and Mrs. Chi were staying at a hotel in Virginia with their pregnant daughter Ann. The hotel suite had two bedrooms with a living room in the middle. That evening she and Ann went to bed  while Dr Chi watched his iPad and ate cherries in the living room. Around 2am  Ann woke to hear him coughing and went to check on him  but he said he was fine. 15 minutes later  he was coughing violently again and struggled to pound on Mrs. Chi’s bedroom door. Ann and Mrs. Chi called 911 and tried to get him to the ground to do CPR. As Mrs. Chi recounts  he kept saying  “I need oxygen  I need oxygen.” He then opened his mouth widely  and said  “I am dying ” and stopped breathing.When the ambulance arrived  they took Dr. Chi to the ICU at Inova Fairfax hospital. His heart and organs were fine  but he suffered a cardiac arrest of unknown cause. What Now?Dr. Chi suffered extensive brain damage. Doctors suggested they pull life support  but Mrs. Chi refused. On July 25  he received a tracheostomy and feeding tube. On July 28  he was moved out of the ICU. On August 16  he was discharged home. With the help of nurses  doctors  physical therapists  occupational therapists  acupuncturists  and the devoted care of his family  he has already shown improvement. He can communicate by blinking his eyes— once for yes  twice for no. He can turn his head left and right  and move his legs  feet  and shoulders  but not his hands. He engages with visitors  and expresses his will. On October 17th  he made his first sound since July 9. Please Donate For Dr Chi’s RecoveryThe medical costs are tremendous  and much of his care is not covered by insurance. He requires a constant nurse  physical and occupational therapists  medication  medical supplies  etc. Medical transportation alone is in excess of $2300 a month  out-of-pocket.Dr. Chi was a generous educator  and gave so much to his students and his community. As former students  we feel very grateful to him for all that he did for us  and believe that many of our former classmates and others in the community feel the same. As he believed in us  we now believe in him  and we hope that you do  too. Any donation is truly appreciated and will go directly to supporting his recovery. If you can  please share this page to help us spread the word. Thank you for your time.Sincerely Anthony and Kimberly Ton---------------About This FundraiserAs we've seen an increase in donations  GoFundMe has requested that we provide the following information in order to be as transparent as possible about this fundraiser.Who we areThis fundraiser has been organized by Anthony and Kimberly Ton  former students of Dr. Chi  and Robert Fischer  a colleague of Dr. Chi's and a math teacher at Honey Creek Middle School in Terre Haute  Indiana. Where we're fromAnthony and Kimberly grew up in Terre Haute  Indiana.

My brothers  Austen and Brice  and I have decided to start a GoFund me page to raise money for our dad on this difficult journey. For those who do not know  January 24th  2019 our dad was diagnosed with cancer. His entire world was turned upside down. That next Tuesday  on January 29th we went to his first appointment  where they decided to admit him to the hospital. This was decided because his femur was at risk of breaking  and also they thought it would be easier to be in the hospital and get all the tests done instead of doing a ton of out patient appointments. So he was admitted on that Tuesday  and we are still here in the hospital as of today the 4th of February. They have done 2 biopsies and discovered that he has a very large Stage 4 Gastrointestinal Stromel tumor on his liver  that has spread to areas on his spine and other bones  including his femur. Once we found that out they went ahead and did another surgery and placed a rod into his femur to protect it from breaking. So right now he is just recovering and getting lots and lots of rest.The plan when he discharges from here is to start Chemotherapy and Radiation  and also go down to MD Anderson in Houston  TX! My brothers and I all know that our dad is a very loved guy!! And very well known. He has such a giving heart and will give his last penny to anyone he knows. He is the most selfless person I have ever met. And to see him going through this is very tough but the strength and hope he has is so inspiring. We have decided to create this GoFund me page to raise money for the hospital bills  the future medical bills wether that be more hospital stays  or just all of his appointments he will be going to. Also his medications he will be on. And raising money to get down to MD Anderson in Houston  TX so we can get the best treatment possible for him. Like I mentioned we know that our dad is loved by so many! So we thought this was a great way to spread the word  keep you guys updated and give anyone the chance to help if they felt called to!!The phrase we have chose is #WITHGOD. #WITHGOD he has strength during this journey#WITHGOD he has peace through this #WITHGOD he has hope in this #WITHGOD he has belief that God is a miracle worker and can get him through this.We are huge believers in prayer  so we ask if you can't give that you guys would join us in prayer for our dad  this is going to be a very long tough journey  but with prayer and #WITHGOD he can do this!!!! Thank you guys so much in advance.  We couldn't do it without you guys!

Lucas has stage 4 Signet Ring Gastric cancer that mas metastasized to his peritoneum. This is a form of aggressive cancer in its late stages in his abdomen. While Lucas is grateful to have a strong emotional support system  advanced life saving cancer treatment comes with serious financial concerns and unexpected expenses that the family would like to be prepared for. Our final goal is to raise $65 000 to support Lucas and his family during this difficult time. However  in order to QUICKLY get support to them and reduce their stress and concern in these first weeks we are praying a need of $40 000 can be raised as soon as possible.Any contribution is greatly appreciated! Background: Lucas and his wife Kristen were celebrating a sweet friends wedding this past weekend when he noticed a lump in his abdomen. Both being in the medical field they quickly met with doctors earlier this week to determine the cause. Lucas had been experiencing some troubling symptoms since Fall of 2016  but was reassured that the symptoms were not a sign for concern. Sadly  that was not the case.After being hospitalized  he continued to hear more about his current condition. Current Condition:Lucas is currently hospitalized in San Diego. The team of doctors have informed the family that while their is hope  his condition is severe and will require aggressive treatment in order to save his life.Treatment plan:He remains in the hospital currently. The doctors will place his port today and he will begin chemo. Originally surgery was the first option  however his cancer more advanced than they had hoped and they must first do 3-6 months of chemotherapy  in hopes that it responds well (only 40% of patients respond well to the chemo) and minimize the size of his cancer throughout his abdomen  surgery will then be an option (please join us in praying for that!!). Their current NEED:Lucas is preparing to fight for his life and needs the constant support of his wife Kristen. Their youngest son  Meyer  is just 15 months old and also needs Kristens constant care. For those that know Lucas had just began CRNA school in September and Kristen was to be the only provider during this time. She now needs to devote her time and love to her family.Lucas is a caring husband  father and friend who always helps out in the best way possible. Now Lucas needs our help. There are hundreds out in the world fighting cancer  and we hope Lucas will survive and heal as soon as possible.We thank everyone for all the help  the donation and also the emotional support and  prayers. Please keep him in your prayers in the coming days  weeks and months."

Her arrival was received with immeasurable joy  but it was not without complications. In her first year of life Jade needed multiple surgeries for a variety of medical conditions.   At the age of 6  Jade received a lifesaving kidney transplant. In all  she has endured more than 30 surgeries and relies on a daily regimen of more than 30 medications to assist her immune system in combatting infections and allow her body to continue accepting her transplanted kidney.  Early this December  Jade experienced difficulty with her vision while driving to high school. She was admitted to Masonic Children's Hospital in Minneapolis.  Jade went through two brain biopsies within a week and the 2nd biopsy revealed that she was suffering from PTLD (Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder)  a disorder caused by the Epstein Barr Virus and use of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent the rejection of a transplanted organ. It is extremely rare to find PTLD lesions in the brain. As a result  Jade will require weekly sessions of chemotherapy in order to prevent the disease from developing into a form of cancer. The longer term plan of treatment will require Jade to travel to Cincinnati to participate in a clinical trial for specialized treatment for CNS PTLD. The Costellos have decided that Barb will take a leave of absence from work to be with Jade during her treatments and all of her upcoming doctor's appointments.  The years of caring for Jade have left the family with substantial medical bills  which will continue to grow with her treatments for PTLD and preparing to receive another kidney transplant.   Because Jade will require substantial medical care this year  both here and in Cincinnati  the Costellos are in immediate need of our help. All monies donated will be used to pay medical bills and pay for the costs of Jade's future treatments  travel expenses to and from Cincinnati  and ongoing medical care.    For those of you who have been blessed to know the Costellos  you are already aware of their upbeat and positive outlook on life and have witnessed their compassion and kindness for others. You know that their spirits and faith are unbreakable. For those of you that do not know them personally  I can share with you that each of them focuses on their blessings over their hardships  believes that they have a purpose in life and an obligation to fulfill that purpose  and trusts in God to show them the way. If you are able  please join me in giving whatever amount you can to help the Costellos through this particularly difficult time in life. Your gift will allow them to focus their efforts on helping Jade get through this difficult time.  Jade with her big brother Chad after surgery. Jade this summer.Jade and her Neurosurgeon."

The impact from the accident caused a fracture of his C3 and C4 vertebrae along with compression of his spinal cord and subluxation of his spinal nerves (a severe structural displacement). The combination of these injuries resulted in instant paralysis from the shoulders down.The closest friends of Upendra’s children  Harish and Dipali  and Dipali’s husband Atish have set up this page to contribute to the financial burden the Patel family faces as they adjust to a new standard.We thank you in advance for your help and kindness.About Upendra PatelFor those of you who don’t know him  Upendra Patel is the husband of Dipika and the father of adult children Dipali and Harish Patel. He is incredibly hard working  passionate about helping others and the spearhead of their family. Upendra created a career in technology and has been an employee at Lucent Technologies for over 30 years. He provided for his family  raising two extremely successful children and serving as the leader of the extended family in Northern New Jersey.This summer  Upendra and Dipika sold the house their children grew up in in Byram  New Jersey and moved south to Dallas where Dipali and her husband Atish had relocated two years prior with the intentions of growing their family. Upendra and Dipika have dreams of being grandparents and have spent countless hours helping Dipali and Atish add the finishing touches to their new home. Dipika taught Dipali all of their family traditions for caring for a home. Upendra did the landscaping  installed security systems  and purchased all of the items needed for recessed lighting with plans to install before Christmas. Upendra spent the last few months nearly inseparable from his daughter. He was once again close by and willing to help her create the life of her dreams.The aftermath of the accidentUpendra was rushed to Parkland Hospital in Dallas where he underwent a surgical intervention procedure consisting of spinal cord decompression and fusion of his cervical vertebrae in an effort to prevent any more damage and reduce pressure and inflammation of his spinal cord. The goal was for him to regain some function below the level of injury. Within 48 hours  he was able to shrug his shoulders and had minimal sensation in his arms. At the 72 hour mark  he was able to bend his elbow and raise his arm off the bed a few inches. At the time of posting this  he has no sensation in and cannot move his wrists  hands or fingers. The medical team is cautiously optimistic that he will be able to use his arms but will continue to have problems with fine motor skills.  Fortunately  Upendra never lost respiratory function and he has been able to breathe and eat on his own. His mental capacity has not wavered. He is cognizant  sharp and still very funny. He is still the leader of the family  directing decisions on insurance and finances and nurturing his wife and children through this emotional time.Unfortunately  life will never be the same for the Patel family. Upendra will likely never walk again. He will not go to work  drive a car or go on vacation. He will not install the recessed lighting in Dipali and Atish’s house as planned. He will not mow the lawn  shovel the snow or perfect his Bloody Mary recipe. He will likely never hold his grandchildren.Life for Upendra moving forwardUpendra was moved out of the ICU on Monday  December 3rd  but remained at Parkland Hospital as complications from his condition impacted his overall health. After being treated for a fever  Upendra moved to a rehabilitation center at Baylor Medical Center on Friday  December 14th and has begun advanced treatment with the medical staff there. Baylor Medical Center specializes in spinal cord injury and Upendra will be in good hands during his stay. It is estimated he will be in the rehab center for 6-8 weeks while treatment and therapy progress. The Patel family ultimately plans for Upendra and Dipika to move back home to New Jersey where they can be surrounded by family members to help with care in the years to come. The medical complications from his quadriplegic state will be life long and having his closest family nearby will be important as they face so many challenges.In this quadriplegic state  Upendra will need a 24-hour home health aide to assist in even the simplest of tasks  including brushing his teeth  bathing  using the bathroom  getting around  eating  dressing himself and many others that we take for granted.Upendra will be more susceptible to blood clots in his legs and lungs as his life continues. His future will include bladder and urinary tract infections and bowel management issues. He is more likely to develop cardiovascular disease based on his forced sedentary lifestyle and he is 10 times more likely to develop sleep apnea. Pneumonia is the biggest risk for those who have experienced spinal cord injuries and has been a leading cause of death for SCI patients over the age of 50.Despite his typically positive demeanor  Upendra’s mental health will also be impacted by his injury. It is estimated that up to 37% of SCI patients experience depression. He will be more susceptible to anxiety  stress and suicide ideation.What your donations will go towardsThe road ahead is both physically and emotionally demanding for Upendra and his family  and there are so many costs to allow Upendra to live his life to the fullest. The estimated lifetime costs of caring for someone with an injury so severe surpass $3 million. The first year costs alone vary between $600 000 and $985 000. It is still unclear what his medical and car insurance will cover  but we know that there are adaptive needs that will need to come out of pocket. Our goal is to help ease this burden.Funds raised will help to cover all medical costs not covered by insurance; a nurse aid which will be needed full time once Upendra returns home; adapted housing; medical equipment and a modified vehicle among countless other needs. *While GoFundMe allows anyone to create a campaign for free  there is a 2.9% processing fee plus a $0.30 fee per donation. We've added an extra $1 500 to our goal to help cover these fees. *Additional information about aging with a Spinal Cord Injury can be found here:  http://sci.washington.edu/info/forums/reports/aging_6.09.asp"

Dan was admitted to the hospital because he was out of breath after having a \"cold\" since November. This \"cold\" with a bad cough out lasted multiple rounds of steroids and antibiotics. Luckily  he went to the ER with the urging by Brittany and a call with  teledoc. Dan was told they had found 4 masses on his lungs and 1 on his media steinum which is under the sternum by the heart  arteries and nerves.  Fast forward to appointments  scans  surgeries and the extremely devastating news.Lives were changed forever. Tears  Shock  terror  denial...They were 90% sure it was cancerous  most likely lymphoma and least possible lung cancer given that Dan is 34 (too young for Lung Cancer!)  in great health (just having finished reffing collegiate soccer in the fall) and a non-smoker. Fast forward days of scans and appointments with Jefferson hospital led us to a Pulmonologist. They did a broncoscopy biopsy. They found that the mass was intruding on his airways which was causing his breathing issues. Due to the size and location of the tumor  they were able to get a large piece of tissue for his biopsy. The wait for Dan and Brittany was torturous. On February 12  they received the devastating news that Dan did in fact have adenocarcinoma lung cancer or Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. They were told that he was either stage 3 or 4 but further testing and scans needed to be done.  On Valentine's Day   Dan had  a stent that would allow his airways to stay open. Unfortunately  they were only able to place one side due to the mass pushing too far into the other side. Through more testing and appointments  as well as an additional biopsy  they were told that Dan's mass on his mediastinum is inoperable  the cancer has metastasized in to other parts of the lung and he is considered stage 4. The positive to all of this testing is that he tested positive for a gene \"mutation\" called ALK. About 3-4% of all lung cancers have the ALK rearrangement. This is the new face of lung cancer  only discoverable by molecular testing. Researchers have discovered treatments that inhibit ALlk+ lung cancer growth which can slow or even stop cancer progression  often with minimal adverse side effects. Although there is no cure  the hope is that these medications increase the life span by years compared to traditional lung cancer. The top doctor for Dan's cancer is located in Boston and will work closely with the doctors close to home to ensure he gets the best treatment possible and this man who is kind  selfless and unwaveringly positive is going to fight. He is going to shatter all statistics and fight this thing.  Dan and Brittany have been together for over 15 years   High  School Sweethearts  both attended Kutztown University then were married in July 2012.   They have Two adorable daughters Francesca aka( Frankie) 4 and Georgia 2.  This is just the beginning of their fight!  Please say a prayer send a donation that will help with the financial burden that arrives with this horrible disease. Our Prayers and Love go out to this young beautiful family the road ahead my not be clear but we have Faith and we have each other !  OUR Village is Large as they FIGHT TO WIN THIS BATTLE OVER LUNG CANCER!!Thank you and Bless you "

severe dehydration and some confusion.  He was previously tested positive for the flu two days before.  It seems as though the flu infection brought to light or flared up a more significant infection happening within his body.Jesse has been diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis which is an infection on and in his heart valve.  He was born with a bicuspid aortic valve (most people have a tricuspid)  so we have always known that he would eventually need a heart valve replacement.  In fact  he told me this on our very first date!  Although of course we had hoped that type of surgery would happen under different conditions.The infection has spread from his heart through his blood to various organs as well as resulting in some strokes on both sides of the brain.  He has limited mobility in his left arm and weakness in his left leg  however we are starting to see him gaining strength and signs of the strokes healing.  Although they have not yet been able to identify the source of infection or the actual bacteria causing the infection  the treatment of antibiotics he has been receiving seem to be slowly knocking it out.  He is receiving excellent health care with a large team of doctors closely monitoring all aspects of his infection and heart condition.  Collectively  they want to see the infection clear further in his body before surgery and also allow time for the strokes to heal so that it will lower the risk of brain bleeds or greater stroke during surgery.  Surgery may happen within 1-2 weeks to replace his valve.Given all of this  we are anticipating a lengthy hospital stay and need for post-acute care.  We do have health insurance and know that the majority of expenses should be covered  however they have done more tests imaginable and continue to do so.  We are sure that there will be a portion of expenses that will not be covered.  So far I just put in a number but will update and change as we get a better idea of what expenses we are looking at.As both of us are vocational missionaries  we raise our salaries based upon individual giving and a close financial support team that believes in us and our ministry.  We do not have a large amount of savings and are asking for our friends and family to support us with these anticipated expenses.I (Andrea  his wife) will be establishing a separate medical account for all medical bills to be paid through.  Any monies raised over and above that are not needed for medical bills will be donated to Touch The World  where Jesse serves as the Executive Director.**Did you find our page from a friend of a friend?  Let me tell you a little more about our Jesse  our family and Touch The World.Jesse and I met while we were both working at Touch The World (TTW) in 2005 and were married in 2006.  In 2008  we moved to Uganda  Africa to serve as missionaries with TTW.  There we helped work with a rural village that was recovering from decades of war.  Through the work we were able to do there  clean water was provided to the community  as well as the start of a large scale medical center  agricultural projects  children's outreach and pastoral training.  (Click here to see what is happening in Uganda today  now under the leadership of Terebinth Ministries. )  We lived and served in Uganda for 5 years  during that time adding three children to our family who are now 15 (Paulina)  8 (Kayleigh)  and 5 (Noah) years old.  In 2013  we were asked to return to NJ for Jesse to take over as Executive Director of TTW in our headquarter office.  At TTW  our mission is to equip youth to live out the mission of God every day  everywhere.  We do this primarily through the vehicle of short-term missions trips - training and equipping youth to go and serve around their country and the world  getting out of their comfort zone and experiencing God in a deep and meaningful way that their they would choose to take their faith as their own and commit to living their life for Him.  We have an incredible team of staff  who are family to us  and we are 100% confident in TTW moving forward in these coming months while Jesse recovers and I support him. www.touchtheworld.org And lastly  I could not finish writing this (lengthy  sorry!) introduction without stating that we are fully confident in Jesse's healing because our trust is fully in the Lord Jesus Christ.  We see him at work in all of this and can point to many things going weeks and months back that have made this the time for the surgery to be needed.  Jesse being in the hospital right now is not at all a surprise to God and therefore  we will not be afraid.  We put our full confidence in Jesus Christ  who is the author and perfecter of our faith and God the Father  the Creator of Jesse's body to restore him to full health.  My anchor verse over these past few days has come from Psalm 33:4-5 (MSG)  \"For God's Word is solid to the core; everything he makes is sound inside and out.  He loves it when everything fits  when his world is in plumb-line true.\"  All of the promises I know about God and are found in his Word can be trusted.  He is faithful.Psalm 33:20-22 (NIV)\"We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.  In him our hearts rejoice  for we trust in his holy name.  May your unfailing love be with us Lord  even as we put our hope in you.\"Our hope is fully found in Jesus Christ and we stand confident in his promises that Jesse will be healed from this infection and come through this surgery.  So here is to a new year - and a new heart!Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support and outpouring of love."

She went to urgent care on the morning of the 12th  where the doctors gave her fluids  and sent her home. Hours later  her headache was unbearable  and she went to the E.R   where she was given a spinal tap and was diagnosed with viral meningitis  and was admitted immediately. But - something wasn’t right. Her body wasn’t fighting the infection  and her liver and kidneys were failing. She was moved to the ICU.  She wasn’t getting better. She began having trouble breathing. Three days later  on March 15th  she was intubated. Family and friends kept a constant vigil  praying for answers. By March 19th  they delivered a diagnosis - hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - also known as HLH.HLH is an extremely rare immune deficiency disorder  where the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs. It’s so rare that when you Google it  all that comes up are scholarly articles that make your head (and heart) hurt. The good news here is that the disease is reversible with chemotherapy and high doses of steroids. She began chemotherapy on the 20th  and was taken off sedation and intubation on the 22nd. After three long weeks in the hospital  Liz is finally back home. She will continue to receive a combination of chemotherapy and steroid treatments  and while the road ahead will be difficult  doctors are confident that she will make a full recovery. Liz fortunately has medical insurance  but this ordeal has been a complete strain financially. As a freelance writer  she hasn’t been able to work for several weeks  and she needs to save every ounce of strength she has to keep up with a rigorous schedule of chemotherapy treatments over the next few months. We want her to focus on getting well  and not on the added stress of covering medical and living expenses with no active income.Your donations will go towards helping Liz get back on her feet  and to help her family  who have taken significant time off from work to be by her side through every step of her journey. No donation is too small. If you are unable to donate  we ask that you consider sharing this link with your friends and family  and to please keep Liz and the entire Welle family in your thoughts and prayers.Liz has touched so many people.

Alex Blaha  Cheri’s husband  noticed the signs and symptoms of a stroke and called 911. Cheri was taken via ambulance to a local hospital. There  a CT scan was performed and it revealed the brain hemorrhage. ER doctors told Alex to call Cheri’s parents as they were not sure Cheri would survive the transport  via ambulance  to a second hospital where a team of neurosurgeons was on standby. Upon Alex  Cheri's parents  her sister  and her godparents’ arrival  the surgeons met and informed them that they could not make any promises  but the surgery that they were to perform would purely be to save Cheri’s life and the rest would be up to Cheri. That night  Cheri underwent a craniectomy. In the early morning hours following her surgery  the prognosis was set pretty low. Alex was told any recovery would be measured in weeks and months  not by days. When she arrived on the ICU unit  doctors informed Alex that Cheri came to the hospital as bad as she possibly could have. Currently  Cheri's abilities and prognosis are very much unknown. It can take months  and in some cases  years  to recover from a hemorrhagic stroke. Cheri is a fighter and is fighting every single day to get better. However  Cheri  Alex  and their families are just in the beginning days of this journey. It will be a long  winding road ahead  but they will always have their eyes up and never down  always looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.

He was Head Winemaker for White Rose Estate   a major wine label where he received many awards for the vintages he helped produce. He had even started bottling his own wine harvested from some under-ripe and undernourished vines that were being thrown out by Vista Hills Vineyard because of a vole infestation.  The young 37 year old oenophile persevered in spite of a lack of encouragement from wine elites but the wine shockingly turned out to be not only \"not too bad\"  as a matter of fact  it was very good. He named it appropriately \"Survivor\" and  bottled it under his own label  Guillen Family Wines.How did Jesus become a winemaker?A native of Chihyahua  Mexico he came to the U.S. to stay long enough to learn English and visit his father who worked at White Rose Estate. Once here  he was infatuated with winemaking and realized he had the palate  the ambition  intelligence and hard work ethic to become an excellent winemaker. And so he did.  In 2009 he produced a vintage that earned one of the highest scores ever given to an Oregon pinot noir by the Wine Advocate and he followed that up in 2010 with two more first and second place vintages on Portland Monthly's list of \"Oregon's 50 Best Wines.\"What does the future hold for Jesus' Family?Jesus' Angels team intends to do all they can to support this extraordinary man's family.

He just turned 51 living fulfilled life  working at Microsoft  still recovering from clipping of an unruptured aneurysm. Darek had felt quite lucky  spared  given second chance. Life was good. We we were looking forward to finally unpacking boxes and start living \"normal\" life in our new home on rural Vashon Island.HOW IT STARTEDOne week after returning to work from medical leave  Darek  my husband and Ruta's dad lost his job as part of Nokia layoffs and started to slur words. BAD OR GOOD NEWS?After twelve nightmarish  months of medical appointments  MRIs  uncertainty  hopes and... more testing  balancing his new consulting job at iSec Partners (now NCCGroup)  and surviving Ruta's teenager transformation. Finally  on a rainy day in December Darek got his diagnosis - Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS). Darek’s neurologist had told him that Darek should feel lucky because it is not ALS and one can live with PLS more than 2-5 years  as is typical with ALS. Then he had introduced an asterisk and fine print: \"However  PLS may turn into ALS over time\". FINE PRINTJust recently fine print has turned into a screaming headline. The real tragedy of ALS that it makes crystal clear what is happening and will happen  while Darek is painfully aware of that. Darek calls it molecular schadenfreude. Every day Ruta and Ania see that he can do less and less  gets more spastic and his muscles disappear. First  they fibrillate. Only after they stop out of breath  they commit seppuku one by one. We all can see that and feel absolutely helpless. Although human body has lots of individual muscles  it is definitely finite. 24/7/365While being wheelchair-bound  speechless  and soon unable to type even with one finger  Darek tries to maintain normal life. I am his sole caregiver. But even heroes reach their limits and get tired from 24/7 shifts. “It breaks my heart to see you putting life on hold and be so exhausted.” Darek has told me. “We need another caregiver to help you.”  SILVER LINING“Surprisingly (to myself) I feel quite fortunate and happy. Mainly for being with Ania  seeing Ruta become a caring and beautiful woman  and having handful of friends who care about us and has not abandoned us. I feel also grateful to Social Security  Medicare  NCC Group (for offering employees Long Term Disability Insurance)  my fantastic palliative team  and to you for your support and generosity.” Darek had told his friends.DAREK’S BUCKET LISTWhen asked about his bucket list  Darek kept it practical:1. get a used wheelchair van to get out of the house beyond wheelchair range  “walk” accessible trails in Puget Sound area  go to Ruta’s high school graduation and send her off to college (she just got accepted to Western Washington University!) 2. hire part-time personal caregiver to offload Ania Various studies point out long-term in-home caregiving ($66 915 per year   not adjusted for inflation) as being the highest expense families of ALS patients have to cover. Unfortunately this vital service is NOT covered by Medicare .   It costs us  especially Darek a lot to ask for help. He  a former risk consultant feels like a failure not to prepare financially for such a “long tail event” (his words). He feels that he failed us. Of course  he is wrong on that.Whether you decide to contribute or not  please do share our story with your friends. We also encourage you to read  contribute and share other ALS stories on this platform.

We are his kindergarten besties  high school and college buddies  musical partners  artistic collaborators  parents of the children he cares for and teaches  fellows in recovery  ex-lovers  fans  family  and new and old friends.While Ari has continued to be there for all of us  perform  and stay active and artistically prolific  he has simultaneously been going through a tremendously difficult period; a fight for his life and for his well-being. As his friends and loved ones  we’re coming together today to ask you  our shared community  to support him financially in a time of need.Since an initial cancer diagnosis in 2013 of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)  Ari has been through a roller coaster of continued tests  biopsies  treatments  hospital stays  and surgeries  leading to years of acute daily pain and disability. Ari’s diagnosis of MDS has progressed to his current diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It is curable with a bone marrow transplant  and he’s lucky to have a match with one of his brothers  as well as an excellent team of health care providers at Sloan Kettering. Ari is starting a course of chemotherapy  requiring a hospital stay for about a month. Depending on the outcome of the chemo  Ari will then return to the hospital for another month to undergo the transplant procedure. Post-transplant  there will be at least three months of recovery.Ari has had good insurance throughout that has covered many of his traditional medical costs. We know that so many of us are not that lucky. However  this diagnosis has impacted him financially  including frequently preventing him from working and causing an accumulation of debt related to his treatment over the many years of dealing with the progression of the disease. Over this next  more serious phase of treatment and recovery  Ari will not be able to work and will have many expenses related to his treatment that aren’t covered by insurance.We hope you will join us in showing up for Ari and donating to this GoFundMe  so he can focus on getting healthy—not on the financial stresses of being sick. If you’re interested in helping  please consider donating through this page. All funds will go directly to Ari to cover his living expenses for the upcoming months  assist with medical expenses not covered by his insurance  and make inroads into the health-related debt accumulated over the last six years.With appreciation Nicole  Dahlia  Ari's family and friends  and the entire #GoldNation"

She had a stomach bug the beginning of the month then mid-month she got a fever and wasn’t feeling well. The low grade fever and varying symptoms lasted 14 days. We visited 3 different pediatricians each diagnosing her differently - virus  acute sinusitis  pneumonia. She was on two antibiotics and not getting better. On Day 14 she spent most of the day in bed. She was tired  not communicating and needed help moving around the house. We took her to the ER and within an hour  she had two focal seizures. The next day she went through a long day of tests and the final  diagnosis was Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)  or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis  a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden  widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. The Doctors believe it was from the stomach bug. The light “m” you can see in the image of her brain is the inflammation. Evelyn is being treated with steroids and IVIG treatment. While initial signs were positive  doctors have not been pleased with her overall progress. We will continue to monitor her and rescan her brain to ensure that there are no other risks.She is expected to remain in the hospital for several weeks or months as needed to help her receive speech and physical therapy for a full recovery. She has lost all speech and much of her movement. Depending on her progress  she may require near or long term assistance once we are discharged. We are taking it one day at a time and blessed for each small victory.Many people have asked us how they can help. Richard has just started a job and will not be returning to it. Emily’s job has been very supportive but it’s challenging to predict the route that Evelyn’s recovery will take us. We also have our two year old son to care for while both of us are active with  Evelyn’s recovery. It is very hard for us to ask for help  but here we are. If you would like to contribute to help fund a meal in the hospital  buy Evelyn some books/toys during her stay  help with the medical bills or contribute so that finances do not influence the type of care we can provide for her - we would be forever grateful.We can’t wait for our strong  sweet  sassy  outgoing  loving girl to be swinging across the monkey bars and riding her bike again.Many blessings to you and yours.CHECK THE UPDATES FOR CURRENT PROGRESS."

After serving in Iraq Ricky went onto active reserve status and is currently serving with the 349th Combat Support Hospital.  Ricky chose to continue his service by becoming a Registered Nurse in 2011.  Ricky has worked as both an ER Nurse and a Hospital Supervisor. Right after completing Nursing School Ricky married Candy. In October 2014 Ricky was blessed with the birth of his twin boys Dustin and Jeremy. In May 2017 Ricky was diagnosed with Pleomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma in his right thigh.  The Cancer is very rare and almost never appears in adults as it is a pediatric cancer.  Ricky has undergone both chemo and radiation therapy multiple time and then had surgery to remove the tumor in his thigh.  Regretfully 6 months later on a follow up scan it was found that the cancer had metastasized to pancreas and lungs.   Different types of treatments were attempted but none were able to stop the progression of the cancer.  Per the Oncologist  due to the rarity of the cancer they had no definitive treatment plan to follow for this type of cancer.Two Oncologists (one from the VA and one from UCLA) both said and wrote letters that the cancer was from his exposure to the carcinogens in the burn pit he was stationed next to in Iraq. Ricky tried to apply for a service connection illness with the army. The military stated that Since the cancer started 7 years after his time in Iraq it cannot be proved as a service connected illness.  Ricky and his wife hired an attorney to try and get the military to recognize the cancer as service related but have had no success so far. It is with great regret that I have to say that we are coming close to the end of Ricky's story.  Ricky has at best 2 to 3 months left.  Currently he is unable to hold nutrition down  is on oxygen24 hours a day and on medication to control pain. Candy has taken a family leave to take care of Ricky. Financially Ricky and Candy are struggling.  Not only do they need to pay their bills  mortgage and all the other things that come with life and children  they also support Candy's parents as well.  Candy has refinanced her house  taken money out of her 401K  and used up all of their savings. Any thing you can give will be greatly appreciated.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Ricky's friendsIf anyone has any questions or would like to verify anything please reach out to :Matt Titner 661-309-0743Robert Ayala:3232466209"

Gregg had gone through a tough summer with the death of his beloved Mother-in-law and had recently got laid off from his job of almost thirty years. His family thought these traumatic events may have played a role in his changes  he had trouble recalling things. As a result  Gregg made an appointment with his primary care doctor in mid-October. The results prompted Gregg's doctor to schedule an MRI for Sunday  October 21st. Gregg and his family got a call first thing Monday morning from his doctor  telling him to go immediately to the emergency room at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Boston. On Tuesday morning Gregg was told that he had a large brain tumor  which the Chief of Neurosurgery believed had all the signs of being malignant. On Thursday  October 25th  Gregg had brain surgery. After the four hour surgery  the family was informed that Gregg has Glioblastoma Stage 4 Brain Cancer. We are told there is no cure for this type of cancer. This news is devastating to Diana  Paul  Elizabeth  and John and their extended family. The last few weeks seem like a nightmare to all of us  but unfortunately  it is our new reality.  We have been told that Gregg is terminally ill and he may live another 12-18 months if he continues with an aggressive course of treatment including chemotherapy  radiation  and perhaps additional surgeries.  Gregg has a great attitude and is extremely brave. If you know him  we're sure you would agree that he is a fantastic person  amazing father  and a loving husband.  Gregg's young children are smart and very close to their father  and our hearts break for them. Diana is the strongest person we know  but she's going to need an immense amount of help to get through this challenging time. She needs to support Gregg's needs and care for her three teenage children.  There are so many expenses that aren't covered by insurance such as insurance deductibles  home nursing care  and some trial programs and treatments. In addition  Gregg is now disabled and can't work. Anything you can do to help Gregg and his family would be greatly appreciated. We encourage you to learn more about this extremely aggressive and deadly form of cancer. Thank you for taking the time to listen to Gregg's story. We pray his story has a better ending than what we've been told."

I was ready to start the new year with fresh enthusiasm and an invigorated spirit. However  in early December  I started to have stomach pains that would migrate to my back.  The pain continued to get increasingly worse and I started to lose weight.  On Christmas Day I was taken to the emergency room in intense pain.  My mom was sure it was my appendix.  My father thought it diverticulitis.  I was sure it was kidney stones. We all had our theory.The diagnosis - Stage 4 Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer!  I was given 7 to 12 months  a diagnosis I’m determined to defeat! I’m unable to work for the first time in my life.  The chemo that I’m receiving is very aggressive and leaves me weak and exhausted most of the time  not to mention all of the fun side effects that come with chemo (I will spare you the details). Unfortunately  since I just started the new job a month before the diagnosis  I’m not eligible for all benefits  i.e. FLMA  Long Term Disability  etc.I have never had to ask for money before  but with normal household bills on top of significant medical bills  I am in desperate need of financial assistance. Social Security Disability benefits won’t begin to cover all of my expenses. As of this moment  medical bills  before insurance  total $109 000 and will continued to rise.My Go Fund Me Goal is $75 000.  This will help pay for current and upcoming medical bills and will provide financial support for my family during this difficult time.Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

However  the “brain cancer victim” description is now unfortunately a new one he has to add to his collection. We received the news around Thanksgiving time that my father only has a few more months left with us and all we can do now is to make him feel as comfortable and loved as possible. One item on his bucket list was to attend a Super Bowl. As fate would have it  we live in Atlanta  Georgia. The Super Bowl this year is in Atlanta  Georgia. He was given 4-6 months maybe to live If things all go well. The Super Bowl is in 2-3 months. Not only is this the most opportune time for him to go to a Super Bowl but it is also his last opportunity. We are trying to raise 15k-30k so we can also send a couple family members with him to help him travel. If any family members  friends  friends of friends  colleagues could either donate or spread the word of my father’s GoFundMe campaign my family would very much appreciate it.  Prayers and good thoughts for my father would mean just as much to my family as well.Beardown  Thank you and God BlessEdit: Thank you so much everyone for the prayers and donations. All the support means so much to my family and me. We are planning on donating all the extra money we raise to a cancer foundation to help continue raise awareness of glioblastoma. If anyone has any recommendations of which charity we should look into we would love to hear what you guys have to say."

Johnny is a hard-working  dedicated father to four incredible children.  A resident of Hillsdale  NJ  Johnny has been active in his community from supporting his children's sporting teams to running golf outings for important causes. Many of you know Johnny from Woodside  his days at Holy Cross or through his work for the International Union of Operating Engineers.  He also worked a second job as a caddy at Ridgewood Country Club.  Either way  to know Johnny is to love him  but if you don't know him  you probably know of him! If you are fortunate to know Johnny  then you know that his cancer  as aggressive as it is  chose a formidable opponent who is showing no signs of relenting. Johnny's fight began with an extensive surgery and the expected hospital stay  follow up doctor visits  consultations  and multiple rounds of chemotherapy.  Though partially covered by insurance  these treatments have led to a great deal of medical and personal expenses which are a major financial burden on Johnny.  Additionally  Johnny is currently pursuing alternative treatments and therapies which are not covered by insurance.  Johnny's cancer has taken a toll on his body and he will likely need to take a leave of absence from work in the coming weeks to give his body the time and space to heal and grow stronger.  While focusing on his health is the most important thing  going without pay causes major stress. We hope  with your help  to get Johnny the financial assistance that he needs so that he may focus all of his energy on getting well.  Johnny is generous to a fault and there is no one more deserving of help and support from his friends  family and neighbors.  Thank you for considering donating to him and his family and for sharing this page with anyone you feel would like to help. UPDATE:  We are overwhelmed by everyone's generosity.   Thank you is an understatement.  The funds collected will be dispersed to Drew Geraghty  who has been put in charge of handling the disbursement of the funds.

She also has the biggest most beautiful heart. I know every mom says that but in my case it's true. When Chantal was 12 years old  we were still living in South Africa and were at a restaurant with her best friend and her best friend's mom  waiting forever for our dinner to come. Chantal was very distracted and kept looking out the window at the corner shop across the street. \"Mommy  can I please have $10?  I'll be right back!\" A very talented dancer (she danced for the Boston Celtics) with the appetite of a linebacker  who had just finished an all-day dance workshop   I assumed she wanted to get a snack before dinner. Recently divorced and just getting back on our feet  dinner was a luxury I budgeted for. As many single-parents could tell you  it's heartbreaking that our kids know when money is tight  and Chantal rarely asked for anything  so I said of course but to hurry back. Five minutes later I saw her come out the shop with a bag of oranges and a few loaves of bread and hand them out to a group of street children and elderly amputee hanging around outside  who she had been watching (unsuccessfully) try to steal something to eat. When she got back to the table  I reminded her that we didn't have a lot of money for her to be giving it away and she said  \"But we have more than them  mommy. Watching them stealing fruit was making me too sad to eat.\"Everyone who knows her has a story just like this one. She has always been incredibly kind  terrible at relaxing  and extremely stubborn  which is why I've started this fund.On December 8  Chantal was rushed to the emergency room at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. She had chest pain  numbness down her arm and began to have petit-mal seizures and involuntary muscle spasms. An MRI showed what looked like vasculitis or a blood clot on her brain. They admitted her for three days and treated her for a TIA (mini-stroke). Her medical team didn't have a clear diagnosis or possible cause and have referred her to multiple specialists and for acute physical therapy. She continues to have intense muscle spasms  and they have affected her face and the way she walks. It hasn't broken her spirit though. She's cracking jokes  staying positive and is still as cheeky as ever! But she needs to rest. Her boyfriend  Aaron  is wonderful and is taking such good care of her. He's held her hand on every ambulance ride  at every doctor's appointment  and through every seizure  he helps her walk and even carries her when she gets too tired. (He needs to rest too.) Unable to run her marketing and product management business  Authentic AF   their two-income household is under severe strain. The bills are piling up. When people need it  Chantal isn't the kind of person to say  \"Let me know if you need any help.\" She just jumps in and starts helping  which is what we're doing for her now. We need her to stop worrying about her bills and focus on getting better. We need her to get better. Please take a moment to give her and Aaron love  whether it's a $5 or $5000 every dollar amount helps. Chantal promises not to spend your donations on drugs and booze. Well  maybe drugs  but only the really expensive ones (like prescriptions )**Chantal made a video below to show her progress \"going on a solo adventure\" and though it left her feeling shaky and awful after  she wanted to remind us all  not to let fear or few setbacks hold us back from our own adventures. I just love her so much** ***UPDATE: It's been FOUR MONTHS and doctors continued to dismiss her symptoms as \"anxiety\". Despite having her on multiple anti-anxiety meds and sedatives. After advocating for herself and pushing for further tests to rule out pathological causes  they discovered she has POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) which affects the heart  a severe movement disorder  AND dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction. Basically her ANS (the part of her brain that controls everything in the body we don't think about like the heart  bladder  digestion  breathing etc) isn't functioning properly and THERE IS NO CURE.  Thanks to her friends Melissa and Adam St Jean  Chantal was referred to a specialist who not only BELIEVED HER but diagnosed her immediately and began remedial treatment right away. Chantal has only had 2 sessions and her speech has already improved. Through neuroplasticity exercises (similar to those used on stroke victims)  medication and diet adjustments she is showing improvement already but her insurance won't cover it  so we're increasing the goal. We're so grateful to all of you! Please  continue to share her story and encourage others to give what they can. With love from our family to yours <3"

She was an active dog walker and pet sitter locally  Urban Tails. Hedda's heart deteriorated to life threatening condition back in September 25  2018. November 16 she was admitted to the Heart Center and started on a continuous Milrinone IV. This is only a very short term- life saving drug. On Tuesday  November 20  the heart transplant team met and decide Hedda needed to fund-raise $10 000 to be considered for placement on the transplant list. Anti rejection drugs are expensive in the USA.   See the attached letter.  This will cover the 20% copay needed for two years of anti rejection drugs.  The transplant team does not want to \"waste\" a vital organ if Hedda cannot afford heart rejection drugs. Understandably.  However  they were not willing to put her on the transplant list even knowing it would still give her time to raise money over a year or so through family and friends. Hedda has received a LVAD (left ventricular assist device) as a bridge to transplant. It is a temporary fix until she gets a new heart. Hedda will still needs more funding to get her thru the next months while awaiting a new heart.  We  Hedda's Care Team  are asking for anything you may be able to afford. We need to keep Hedda on the heart transplant list and the current out of pocket costs are several hundred dollars a month. Please help if you can.Hedda was discharged home on December 18  however she has had to return several times to the Emergency Department for re-admission and observation due to VAD alarms. All goals are met.

Jenelle starts flying to Houston this week.  She'll be there most Thursdays and Fridays  and flying back to Central PA on Saturday mornings.  Any amount you would like to give to help her journey is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for all the love and support.  Please keep Jenelle in your prayers!"

Following a CT scan and MRI his parents and extended family heard the news and diagnosis that no parent should ever hear. Theo had a mass on his brain and would need immediate surgery to remove it to determine the type and malignancy of the tumor. On Sunday morning  January 20  Theo had a 5hr surgery to implant shunts in his skull to allow fluid and pressure to drain  and to have the tumor removed. After the tumor was removed  doctors diagnosed Theo with medulloblastoma  an aggressive brain cancer which must be treated with chemotherapy. There will be several rounds of chemotherapy including inpatient hospital stays and outpatient clinic visits  as well as a stem cell transplant.  Theo started his first round of chemotherapy on February 11 at Hackensack Children's Hospital  and will be in the hospital for at least one week.  Later on in February  Theo will have surgery to harvest his stem cells which will be reintroduced to him after chemotherapy ends.

It turns out that he has an extremely very rare condition called Alexander’s Disease which is a terminal disorder that affects his nervous system. Unfortunately  there is no treatment for this condition past treating symptoms and keeping Robert comfortable. This is a heartbreaking  diagnosis  and if you could keep Robert & his Family in your prayers  they would appreciate it.Robert’s story:For the past 2 ½ years  his parents were told that 11-year-old Robert had a psychological eating disorder. He has been on medication  through therapy after therapy  been made to force himself to eat  has endured countless feeding tubes to nourish his body  and has been tormented by the lack of desire to eat. All the while Robert maintained  vigilantly  that there was something wrong with him and that his condition was not psychological  only to have his claims refuted by a myriad of doctors. His ongoing ordeal has been a constant torment for this family  that’s breaking his parent’s heart. As a last chance intervention  Robert was admitted to a specialized hospital for eating disorders in Virginia for help.  While away  he became ill  confused  and suffered severe respiratory distress. He was transferred from his facility in Virginia to Virginia Children’s Hospital in Richmond Virginia. Robert was suffering from pneumococcal pneumonia  and he placed on a ventilator. While the family was there with him  they explained his 2 ½ year ordeal to the doctors. They decided to a ct-scan  and they were shocked to see that the ct-scan had revealed a tumor on his brain stem that inhibits the ability to swallow. This news was even more heartbreaking for the parents because it turns out that Robert was right all along  and suffering from nobody taking him seriously. The tumor grew to the point that it’s affecting his breathing and requires Robert to be on a ventilator full time until the doctors can determine how to address his situation. Last weekend he was transported from Virginia back to New York  and he is currently in the ICU unit at Cohens Children’s Hospital. Unfortunately  the tumor is inoperable because of its location on the brain stem  which is where all bodily functions  both voluntary and involuntary  are controlled.  Although they can’t operate on the tumor because of its location  A specifically guided biopsy is going to be done to see if there are any weaknesses in the tumor that they can exploit with medications. This guided biopsy is an extremely critical procedure that requires Robert to have a pacemaker attached to his heart because the procedure will affect his heart rhythm and will cause him to suffer some form of paralysis as a result of the procedure  that hopefully will be temporary. This 2 ½ year nightmare has taken an emotional and huge financial toll on this family. Insurance coverages were limited during this ordeal which resulted in the family amassing massive medical bills and well as massive debt to try to get their son the best care possible. This go fund me was created to help this family through this indescribable ordeal financially.

"Medical","November 6, 2018","Zach&apos;s Fight Against Brain Cancer","$39,680","$60,000","233","5","238","1.3k","PORTORCHARD","WA","Zach Becker is a father  husband  business owner  and all-around amazing guy living in Gig Harbor  WA with his wife  Megan  and their 16-month-old son  Scout.  Anyone who knows Zach has a story to tell about his generosity and sense of humor. He is the first to strike up a conversation with a stranger   welcome you into his home for a meal  or simply offer you a cold beer at a backyard barbeque.  He approaches life with a zest that is contagious and being able to call him a friend is truly a blessing.  On October 16th  2018  at the young age of 35  Zach was diagnosed with a brain tumor after being brought to the Tacoma General ER.   For several months leading up to his diagnosis  Zach was experiencing episodes of numbness and pain in his right hand and leg.  Due to his active lifestyle  it was easy to dismiss thinking it was simply a pinched nerve.  As the weeks carried on Zach's symptoms got worse and in conjunction with his numbness episodes  he began waking disoriented and smelling phantom burning smells.  Recognizing his changing symptoms  Zach's wife Megan  who is a nurse  insisted they go back to the ER and get some answers.   During his visit  an MRI was performed and his tumor was discovered.  Zach and Megan learned the episodes he was experiencing for the past couple of months were actually seizures and he was immediately placed on high doses of anti-seizure medications.  At that time Zach was admitted for observation and a biopsy surgery was scheduled.   ( Zach's tumor  approximately 4cm x 7cm )Zach and Megan's family and friends rallied around them in prayer during those fearful days as they waited to get back the biopsy results.  After a few days that seemed like an eternity   Zach was diagnosed with a Stage 2 astrocytoma with an IDH1 mutation.  Although this is a typically slow-growing tumor it is still considered cancerous.  Due to the location and characteristics of the tumor  they have determined that it is inoperable at this time.  The risks of damaging critical areas of the brain controlling speech and motor function make this less than an ideal option.  Treatment at this time will consist of six weeks of Proton therapy radiation followed by at least one round of chemotherapy.  Since Zach needs this specialized Proton therapy radiation at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance he will have to travel to Seattle every day during the six weeks of treatment.  For those that don't know  Seattle is more than an hour away from their home without consideration of traffic.  Since learning of his diagnosis  Zach has had nothing but an upbeat attitude putting his trust entirely in God.  His positivity and unwavering faith are an inspiration to those around him.  Zach is the first to lend a hand and not the type to ask for help but those of us that love him want to ensure that he and his family have the resources needed to fight this!  We would like to make the financial burdens and medical costs less of a worry  as this should not be his concern right now.  Without a doubt  we know Zach will beat this but we ask that you band together with the Becker family and their friends in prayer during the long battle ahead.Thank you for your prayers  generosity  and kindness. It means the world to us.With Love Zach’s Family and Friends"

Please read our mom's story below  but if not  short and sweet: our mom is listed to receive a double lung transplant because she cannot breathe on her own without high flow oxygen at the hospital  due to multiple disorders. With her in hospital stay  the transplant  medications  out of network procedures and post-surgery care giving  we will be accumulating multiple  and very expensive bills. We appreciate any and all help for our family.Those of you who know our mom know that she has a very active lifestyle  whether it's teaching classes at LA Fitness  doing in-home private massages for friends and clients  teaching CPR and First Aid classes  as well as teaching courses at William Paterson University for the Department of Kinesiology as an Associate Professor  sometimes all four happen in a single day. Our mom has always been known as the workaholic  because she loves what she does. She loves spreading awareness for healthy and active lives. At the age of 60  our mom earned her doctorate in Movement Science and her deep love for the profession and teaching is what kept her motivated. Our mom has been diagnosed with Limited Scleroderma  which has caused her to obtain the disorder of Pulmonary Hypertension. Basically  she can no longer breathe on her own.Scientifically  PH is a type of high blood pressure that affects the pulmonary artery  lungs and the right side of your heart.  As the pressure builds  your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs  eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail.It all started with getting a little out of breath from walking long distances or up a small set of stairs  however that quickly began to change. This summer our mom went on a road trip with her friends  bringing her oxygen for when needed. At the end of September  she wasn't sure if she could leave the house (and her oxygen tanks) for Ricky's birthday dinner  but brought her portable tank. For Thanksgiving  she was on oxygen 24/7.Eventually our mom revealed to us that she was in need of a double lung transplant. However  she was going to need multiple tests and doctors appointments to qualify for the transplant and be placed on the transplant list.Fast forward  at this point in time our mom has been at New York Presbyterian Hospital since January 9th  on high oxygen flow  24/7  and watched by nurses and doctors regularly.Thankfully  we learned on February 6th that she has been listed on the Lung Transplant list!! At any moment we can receive the call that she goes into surgery to receive new lungs and get a second chance at life and her active lifestyle!With the preliminary tests and appointments  current hospital stay  out of network procedures  eventual transplant  medications and post transplant care giving  the overwhelming expenses will have added up and the insurance company will not be covering everything. We are asking you to help our family defer costs in order for our mom to return to a normal life after her transplant.Love  Stevie and Ricky"

The disease had spread to the lymph nodes in his neck  underarms  and lungs and around his spleen  abdomen and groin. This obviously came as a massive shock to our entire family. Within 3 days of this diagnosis my brother Bill and sister-in-law Heather had Barrett checked into one of the top children’s cancer hospitals in the country for treatment  Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora.Barrett is now one of 55 children enrolled in a cancer study conducted at the Hospital that will require 12 taxing chemotherapy treatments over the next 6 months. Overall  Barrett will be involved in 38 clinical visits over the next 2 years after what we hope and pray is a very successful cancer treatment.Not only do Bill and Heather have the emotional toll of having their son go through this  but a major financial burden is now upon them. While they do have insurance and the clinical treatment will pay for the chemo  they do not have travel and lodging covered and this is where we could use any help possible.They live in Big Timber Montana  which is 630 miles away from Children’s Hospital in Aurora. That is either a 17 hour round trip by car  or a 7 hour round trip by plane/car. The Ronald McDonald house in the area is full  so they’re having to stay in a hotel across the street while in Aurora.Heather will not be able to work during this time and Bill will be taking as much time off as possible to be with Bear. What we’re hoping to do is set up a fund to help provide a travel  lodging and meal budget for the next 2 years of commuting and staying between their home and Aurora. We are grateful and appreciative of the possibility of a donation to this cause. We also understand that it might not always be possible to contribute financial resources to a fund  and if that’s the case  we will happily take positive thoughts and prayers to Barrett’s full and speedy recovery.Lastly  if you feel that someone else might interested in helping out the family at this time  it would be awesome if you could pass this on.Thank you so much."

On December 12th  we received a phone call that she suffered a brutal attack and was immediately transported to Trauma ICU. Her situation is devastating  and remains critical. In light of her current condition  we prefer these photos of our Mom  as she would not want us to show photos of her traumatic injuries.   For someone who never cared to be in the spotlight  our mom now has everyone’s full attention. We know that the cost of her time she will spend in ICU  along with surgery  physical therapy  and at home nursing care will be high. We created this page because the situation is dire. Please know that any amount — no matter how big or small — will benefit our mom. Whether for medical care or flights for us to be with her  your donation will make a significant difference. We are doing our best to support her  but know that we will run into obstacles by having to put other day to day priorities on pause including things like work  graduate school  and a new baby boy in our family.  Our mother’s injuries are extensive. The hospital staff’s main concern is her traumatic brain injury that is preventing her from waking up. Because of this  she is being assisted with breathing and given constant medication to control her pain. Her facial fractures are widespread and will require facial reconstructive surgery. Her other injuries include stab wounds to her shoulder and face  rib fracture  cervical neck fracture  and a blood clot in one of her lungs. Even though all of her injuries are reversible  there is a large unknown in regards to the speed of her recovery. The hospital is aggressively treating all of her conditions to the best of their ability. As she continues to stabilize  the trauma ICU is diligently working and strategically planning procedures based on priority.  Everyone who has ever met Sheri  knows she is an incredible Mother  Grandma  Daughter  Friend  Sister  and Fiancé. Our Mom is the most loving and generous person you could ever meet. She has always been the calm voice in chaos  and the rock in our lives. Last year  our Mom moved from Las Vegas to Philadelphia to be with the love of her life Carmen. We were so happy to see this exciting life change and had so much comfort in knowing she’s found a person to share her life with. It has been heartbreaking for us to see her in this state  knowing that she’s found a love we’ve always wished for her to have. This is without question the darkest time in our lives  but our mother would want us to stay strong and hopeful for a full recovery  no matter how long that takes. Please send out your thoughts and prayers to our Mom so that she may physically and mentally be at peace as she heals. With Gratitude From Her Loving Daughters and Fiancé  Cameo  Karina  and Carmen"

As they pulled up  Cole seemed to suffer a seizure/lose consciousness. She went into cardiac arrest. The ER team worked on her for 20-25 minutes to get her heart working again  which they ultimately did  but she was still unconscious. She was admitted to the ICU there  and they determined that she had fallen into a coma and suffered an anoxic brain injury (lack of oxygen to the brain). On Thursday  February 21  she was moved to INOVA Fairfax Neuroscience ICU for better monitoring. After several weeks of tests and monitoring  but no progress  the doctors delivered the horrible news that there was nothing else that could be done and she was transitioned to hospice care. More details on her story can be found here:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/coleoshea Why are we setting up this account?Thomas hasn’t so much endorsed me doing this  as he has acquiesced to my gentle nagging. But I  like many of you that have reached out to me with the same idea  think it is a way to create options in a time of few choices. As the unimaginable unfolds around Cole and her family  so many people have been asking how to help. So much has been done already - Coverage for Sabine (10) and Henry (8) has been arranged so that Thomas can be at the hospital to sit with Cole and meet with doctors. Meals have been organized. Messages of support have been posted daily.  The support from the community has been amazing – thank you so much!  Our new goal is $47 000  in honor of Cole's 47th birthday (3/23).What will the money be used for?This GoFundMe account is being set up in honor of Cole O’Shea. The money can be used to help with both the practical and maybe even the not-so-practical. The money will be turned over to Thomas so he can use it for whatever will benefit the kids the most. It will be 100% his choice.  I’ll be honest though  I hope that we raise so much money that he can use some of this fund to help with practical things like childcare this summer  or housekeeping services  or even doggie day care for Bernie  their 120 lb Bernese Mountain dog (puppy). I also hope that Thomas will use some of the money like Cole would: to buy Sabine some ridiculously expensive yellow tennis shoes that will fit for one season  simply because she loves yellow and they make her face light up. Or  maybe he could use it to send Henry to fishing camp so Henry’s love of the outdoors and nature will continue to flourish in new ways (that may  or may not  include another fish tank in his room). Most of all  I hope that when he does use these funds  he'll feel all of the love and support that is around him. I know that no matter what - practical or with an eye towards Cole's fun side - he’ll use the money with love to care for Sabine and Henry in the best way possible.Thank you very much for reading and considering supporting this amazing family!"

Ellery’s diagnosis confirms for us that she is truly one in a million  since that’s how unlikely it is for a child to get Opsoclonus Myoclonus Syndrome. It is heartbreaking to see our beautiful Ellery struggle to eat  communicate  move  and play - all things she did with joy and ease until just before Christmas - and to see my brother  Brad  and sister-in-law  Maura  work so hard to get her the best care possible. In early December  Brad and Maura noticed that their adorable little munchkin was unsteady on her feet  bumping into things  had shaky hands  and was extremely agitated. At Boston Children’s Hospital  Ellery endured painful and scary tests  including a brain MRI  a lumbar puncture and lots of blood work. Doctors thought she had a virus and assured her worried parents that the symptoms should go away on their own soon. Instead  her symptoms got much worse and by Christmas  Ellery was unable to walk  stand  feed herself or speak clearly. The next day  Brad and Maura noticed that Ellery’s eyes were making unusually rapid movements and fluttering  which was one of the warning signs doctors had told them to look out for. They rushed back to Boston Children’s Hospital where Ellery had another set of tests  including a full body MRI. Doctors delivered the shocking news that Ellery’s scary neurological symptoms were the result of OMS - an extremely rare autoimmune disease that she will battle for the rest of her life. We don’t know why Ellery got OMS. In 50% of patients  OMS appears when the body is trying to fight off a cancerous tumor  called a neuroblastoma  but starts attacking the brain instead. None of Ellery’s tests detected a tumor or cancer  so she may be part of the other 50%  and we may never know what sparked her immune system to start damaging her brain. OMS causes loss of muscle control  chaotic eye movements  involuntary tremors  and fits of rage that for most patients are lifelong. In the UK  OMS is often referred to as Dancing Eyes-Dancing Feet Syndrome because of the muscle jerks and eye movements the disease causes. Amidst their terror and sleep deprivation  Brad and Maura rung in 2019 at Boston Children’s Hospital  where they spent 10 days encouraging and loving Ellery through more tests  procedures and treatments. Ellery is undergoing a very aggressive treatment regimen to try to stop the attack on her brain and recondition her immune system. Every 4 weeks for the next few years  they will return to Boston Children’s Hospital for several days so Ellery can receive infusions of high doses of steroids  Rituximab (an antibody therapy medicine)  and IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin). In between infusion treatments  Ellery will go home and work with neurologists  physical therapists  occupational therapists and speech therapists to try to regain the motor and speech skills that OMS is stealing from her. So far  her determination and persistence have impressed her family and her health care providers. Despite her frustrating lack of control over her muscles  she does not give up  whether she’s trying to stack legos during OT or feed herself with a spoon. It is inspiring to see her work so hard! At this point  Ellery is not well enough to attend her beloved school  Transportation Children's Center. She misses her teachers and friends and talks about them all the time! In the short-term  Brad and Maura are relying on family and temporary nanny help so that they can continue to work at their full time jobs. As many of you already know  Brad is a small business owner and Maura works for Joslin Diabetes Center.   Because OMS is so rare  no one can tell us exactly what Ellery’s future holds. But  we do know some things: - We know that Ellery is a fierce fighter who is battling OMS with every ounce of her strength.- We know that her parents are fierce protectors  determined to give her the best chance at having the highest quality of life possible.- We know that Ellery is a fiercely cherished little girl - the many thoughts  prayers  well wishes  meals  cards  calls  and texts Brad and Maura have received are proof of that. Many people are asking how they can help. To those of you who have reached out and helped in some way already  Brad and Maura are really grateful. Thank you so much! If you would like to make a donation of any amount  your support will be tremendously appreciated. It will fill them with love and help them with:- current and future hospital and doctors’ bills. - medicine and treatments. - outpatient therapies. - living expenses while at least one of them takes time off work. - specialized child care. - Ellery's future care. -research to help find a cure for Ellery and the other one in a million kids like her. Brad and Maura feel tremendously grateful for the supportive care team they are working with at Boston Children's Hospital. There are very few doctors in the world who are familiar with OMS. Ellery is fortunate to live near such an amazing hospital with doctors who have experience treating and researching this very rare disease. To contribute to this body of research and hopefully provide insight into the disease  Brad and Maura have enrolled Ellery into studies being conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital.   Anyone who knows Brad and Maura knows that they don’t ask for help lightly. But  OMS is too big and strong for any one family to fight on their own. They greatly appreciate your support of them and Ellery during this really hard time  while they do everything possible to support her recovery.

Dziewiętnaście miesięcy temu zostali szczęśliwymi rodzicami Amelki  u której w siódmym tygodniu życia zdiagnozowano nowotwora nerki (mesoblastic nephroma). Natychmiastowa operacja usunięcia organu i pobyt w szpitalu przywróciły fizyczną kondycję dziecka.Od tej pory Amelka była pod stałą kontrolą onkologów  którzy potwierdzali prawidłowe wyniki bad. Dwa tygodnie temu Amelka niespodziewanie dostała wylewu i znów znalazła się na intensywnej terapii. Wnikliwe badania wykazały 5 centymetrową zmianę nowotworową na płucu dziecka (fibrosarcoma). Przeprowadzono trepanację czaszki w celu określenia rozległości wylewu i zaistniałych zmian w mózgu. Obecnie Amelka przebywa w szpitalu onkologicznym  a jej stan jest ciężki ale stabilny. Rodzice czuwają nad nią dzień i noc  mówią do niej  dotykają  masują jej zwiotczałe mięśnie. Nikt nie wie jaki będzie stan fizyczny Amelki po całkowitym wybudzeniu. Opiekując się córeczką całodobowo  Justyna i Staszek nie mogą chodzić do pracy  a codzienne wydatki i opłaty pochłaniają dotychczasowe oszczędności. Dlatego gorąco prosimy o pomoc finansową aby wesprzeć rodziców Amelki w tym bardzo ciężkim dla nich czasie. Serdecznie dziękujemy za każdy przekazany datek.Dear friends  we turn to you with a great request for spiritual and financial support for Justyna and Staszek. Nineteen months ago  they became happy parents of Amelka  who was diagnosed with kidney cancer (mesoblastic nephroma) in the seventh week of her life. Immediate surgery to remove the organ and hospital stay restored the physical condition of the child.From that point  Amelka has been under constant control of the oncologists who confirmed the correct results of the test. Two weeks ago  Amelka unexpectedly had a stroke and yet again ended up in intensive care. Insightful research has shown a 5 centimeter tumor change on the child's lung (fibrosarcoma). A skull trephination was performed to determine the extent of the stroke and the changes in the brain. Currently  Amelka is in an oncology center  in serious but stable condition. Parents watch over her day and night  talk to her  touch her  massage her flabby muscles. No one knows what the physical state of Amelka will be after waking up completely. Taking care of the daughter round the clock  Justyna and Staszek can't go to work  and daily expenses and fees absorb the current savings. Therefore  we kindly ask for financial help to support Amelka's parents in this very difficult time. Thank you for your donation."

However  on the night of January 6th  Tahia became violently ill  after which she fell into a coma on January 7th and was admitted to the ICU and put on life support. The doctors diagnosed her with brain encephalopathy  being unable to pinpoint a single specific cause for the severe reaction and subsequent internal brain injury.After consulting with the doctors  family members  and consultants from other hospitals in Bangladesh  a decision had been made that in order for Tahia to receive the best immediate care to save her life and treat her condition  she had to be taken to Bumrungrad Hospital in Thailand. The following day  Tahia was transported to Bangkok via an air ambulance along with her family and admitted to the ICU at Bumrungrad Hospital. By the third day  Tahia began to regain her consciousness  while continuing being supported with a ventilator and intubated feeding. She was making solid progress initially; however  she had undergone two bouts of pneumonia after which the doctors completed a tracheostomy to treat her infection  adding more pressure to her condition. Despite everything  Tahia continues to show a tremendous amount of strength and perseverance towards her recovery with her parents and family members by her side. Currently  she is still being treated at Bumrungrad  as her parents are making plans to transfer her back to the states once she is in a stable condition to make the journey back. With an already lengthy inpatient stay at Bumrungrad  a considerable amount of medical bills has already amounted  not including the additional cost of the initial air ambulance  future medical transport  necessary rehabilitation that includes physical and speech therapy. Unable to work in her state  Tahia will have no income  depending on support from family for current and future expenses including long-term rehabilitation  increased health insurance costs and everyday living expenses  as she continues on her on long path to recovery. We ask for your help with any donation amount possible to help relieve some of the financial pressure off of Tahia’s parents as they care for Tahia throughout this difficult time. While Tahia’s progress is encouraging  she has an arduous journey ahead to regaining all her abilities and returning to the life she had. Throughout all of this  Tahia has proven time and time again that she is a fighter  and we are absolutely sure with your help  she will once again regain her strength and abilities and be the ever determined  ever feisty Tahia Rahman we all know and love!
