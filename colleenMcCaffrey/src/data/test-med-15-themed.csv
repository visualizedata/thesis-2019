A new smile for Conor,https://www.gofundme.com/w2x34,9,WOODSTOCK,GA,My son Conor has recently been experiencing some great pain in his teeth so I took him to the dentist and was quoted $7 000 to complete the work he needs to relieve the pain. Conor is 21 and works full time but has no dental or health insurance. We went to 3 different dentist to try and find the best financial option.  We also applied for medical loans and were turned down. It bothers me greatly that I am not in a financial position to help him get the work completed.  If you could help by donating what ever amount you are able to it would be greatly appreciated.,350,2100,18,17,7,26,6

Healing to Cherie Giambalvo,https://www.gofundme.com/17n1i8,9,CHICO,CA,Cherie was working out in a boot camp in August and she hurt her neck doing hardly anything at all. She had to quit the boot camp and had been trying to make her neck better ever since by seeing massage therapists and chiropractors. A couple of weeks ago one of the chiropractors took an X-ray before working on her and noticed one of her vertebrae was disfigured. He would not work on her and encouraged her to see a doctor. Within about a week the doctors did more tests. Soon after  she got a call from her general practitioner who asked her to pack a bag and head to the ER. She did but still had no idea what was going on but did not believe it was cancer. The same evening she admitted herself into the emergency room and after receiving the MRI results  the doctors stuck her in an ambulance and sent her to UCSF where they did emergency surgery to remove a mass on the back of her neck that was causing all of the pain. The doctors were shocked she was not paralyzed. After they removed the mass  they proceeded to let her know that she had cancer throughout her body... her liver  pancreas  kidney and femur bone. What was thought was a neck injury turned into her worse nightmare within 24 hours. She is still healing from this intrusive surgery and is in a lot of pain. Her boys  Luciano (age 19) and Santino (age 21) are with her at home trying to help around the house as much as possible while both maintaining their jobs. Gia (age 23) had to go back to San Diego to work. Cherie is unable to work. She will receive her pathology report and plan of attack on the cancer this week. We will keep you all updated. Thank you for your healing prayers and positive thoughts! If you'd like to drop off a snack or a meal please see the link below. Meal Train for Cherie,7685,10000,14,77,80,417,14
Loving Father in Need,https://www.gofundme.com/1csxow,8,TACOMA,WA,My name is Eduard German and I am making this on the behalf of my Dad  Pavel German. On Saturday  November 17th  tragedy struck our family as our dad had suffered a severe hemorrhagic stroke. It was a miracle that he survived long enough to even reach the hospital. He is currently in Harborview hospital in seattle  in the ICU. He has gone through 3 surgeries on his brain  and is currently in a stable condition making daily improvements. He is awake and fully comprehensive  but due to the swelling  his mobility and functions are highly limited. It has been a week and a half in ICU and although he has medical insurance  these things are incredibly expensive. As he begins his long road to recovery now  our family is constantly here with him so he feels comfortable with our voices and so that we can translate the doctors commands to him since his english was very limited to begin with. He is a loving father to 4 kids  a loving husband to his wife Tanya  and a Grandfather to 8 little kiddos that need him in their lives. Any financial contribution will go towards his medical bills and helping his wife survive while she is here with him daily. If you are unable to help  please say a prayer. Dad has been a fighter his whole life. He has battled through moving to a different country  having a severe heart problem  and raising 4 kids in a place where he had no language and barely a penny to his name. He has never asked for anything in return  and since he is a fighter  we know he is fighting his best to battle back from this. Thank you to everyone in advance  and I will be consistently providing updates on his status here  to anyone interested. May God bless you all.,2610,50000,9,5,27,249,5
Lewallen&apos;s Medical Despair,https://www.gofundme.com/lewallensmedicalfund,0,SANCLEMENTE,CA,I would say my family prides ourselves on staying strong through thick and then  never relying on anyone and It's extremely awkward and humbling to ask others for help  especially knowing everyone has a hill to climb and some are more steep than others. Well today I've finally decided to let go of my ego and ask for your help with my family series of unfortunate events. Some may know my family  some just myself  and some of you may know nothing of us. So I'll begin by telling you how badass my family is  my mother is either insane or positively  invincible with all the medical lows she's been thrown her way with our family in the past 15 years.It started off with myself being diagnosed with Crohns disease at the age of 12  a continuous up hill battle  living in the hospital months at times and almost taking my life  next to my dad being diagnosed with stage 5 prostate cancer   proceed to my grandfathers (My moms fathers) death  back to me with multiple surgeries and now 5 years later back to my fathers reoccurrence of prostate cancer.  We obviously go all out when it comes to lack of health haha. It's been a whirlwind both emotionally and financially. My family are fighters thats for sure  but our time has come that we can't possibly do it on our own without loosing everything they have built up. One night in the hospital is thousands of dollars  and we've been a frequent costumer of the hospital for fifteen years now and I don't think  well I know financially we can take much more. With my dad not being able to work and my mom trying to take care of everyone and do her job to support the family and the outrageous amounts of money medical care cost  it's a never-ending financial hole. So here I am  asking others of their hard earned money  which seems morally wrong  to help out my family. We've had amazing times through all the hard times and I wouldn't trade my families fate for the life of me because it has made us so close  but my family is in need and I believe they deserve it. My mother and two sisters have been through hell and back dealing with my Fathers and I potentially fatal medical conditions and I just want the slightest bit of relief for them. My father travels to and from Chicago for treatment once a week at the Cancer center of America  luckily I am doing miraculously healthy at this time but will most likely be in medical debt my entire life  which is a fair trade for my health.The Money will be going towards my dads medical treatments and make up for his time on sick leave. I'm Grateful for those who have even taken the time to read this incredibly long and poorly written letter. Thank you for your time and Love!With all my Love Carson Lewallen,2010,20000,33,10,32,30,10

Rita Cargill Ellerd Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/984xuc,2,BRAZORIA,TX,Hi everyone  my name is Joshua Ellerd  I am asking for your help with the medical bills my mom  Rita Cargill Ellerd  is facing.This has been an incredibly tough year and a half for her and Dad. Their home flooded during Hurricane Harvey and they lost all of their furniture  most of their personal belongings and because river water and mud ran through the house for days  it had to be gutted floor to ceiling. They are back in the house but there is so much work to be done  Mom calls it “rustic glamping”. In addition  Dad has had some health problems and their thriving service business of 26 years lost 60% of its customer base overnight due to so many customer's homes flooding. While some customers are returning home  many have no intention of returning to the area. Now  in addition to the devastation of hurricane Harvey they face staggering medical bills.The months-long cough she attributed to “flood crud” and the more recent bouts of dizziness and serve headaches she thought were due to an ear infection were much more serious. On Wednesday 11/28/2018 Mom was diagnosed with Lung Cancer that metastasized to her brain. The tumor in her brain was removed December 6th but she did not have insurance and the costs are astronomical!  She is currently undergoing treatment. Our goal is to raise money to help offset these costs so she won't have to worry about finances while fighting this disease. Whether you know her are Rita  Spirit or Judge  she could sure use your help right now. If you can't contribute  we completely understand but ask you to please help by sharing this with your friends and family so the word gets out.  All assistance is greatly appreciated.,480,10000,8,5,7,72,5
"Help Me Fight Abuse, Cancer, &amp; More",https://www.gofundme.com/chrisoleary,7,SAINTLOUIS,MO,My name is Chris O'Leary and I'm a survivor of abuse by a Catholic priest.And worse. Most recently  I told my story -- and described the plight of survivors -- to EWTN.- Why Two States Might Begin a Probe Into Clergy Sex Abuse The total economic impact of my abuse on my family and me is roughly $2 000 000  given my level of education and income before I experienced a nervous breakdown.However  ANYTHING people can contribute would be appreciated.The gist of my story is as follows...1. The Archdiocese of St. Louis and the Catholic Church promise treatment for survivors of abuse by priests  but what I received was only torment; psychological abuse on top of my original sexual abuse. A year ago I did receive a settlement of $9 000 (net) from the Archdiocese  but I lived off of that settlement over the past year as I fought to help the other survivors  known and unknown. But that money is now gone.2. I was forced to settle for that small settlement  instead of going to trial  due to a the (sadly successful) efforts of the Archdiocese of St. Louis to create a problem with the Statute Of Limitations by first Gaslighting me and then giving me the Run-Around. And I'm not the only survivor the Archdiocese of St. Louis did that to.3. I was fighting CANCER (Malignant Melanoma) at the same time (2013-2016) I was fighting the Archdiocese of St. Louis -- which they knew due to the lawsuit I filed and the discovery process -- leaving me with $6 000 of unpaid medical debt to SLU hospital and my surgeon  to go on top of all my other debt.4. I've spent the past year -- coincidentally  EXACTLY a year -- fighting to force the Archdiocese of St. Louis to recognize the (continuing) plight of survivors like me. And to help us. Actually. First  my efforts were rewarded and my prayers were answered with the announcement that the Attorney General of Missouri is opening an investigation into the actions of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Most recently  the pressure I've been putting on Timothy Cardinal Dolan  archbishop of New York  has forced him to open up the Archdiocese of New York to (limited) outside scrutiny.However  while my efforts have achieved a lot  I'm broke.Bankrupt.When I last checked  I had $.40 to my name.Yes  40 cents.Fighting the Archdiocese of St. Louis  forcing them to open their files to the Attorney General of Missouri  and financing that fight with my settlement  was worth it.Completely.But it's left me mentally and physically exhausted.And literally hungry.FIGHTINGI've been trying to tell my story for one year  and I finally got the attention of Aisha Sultan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in April 2018.- Priest sex abuse survivor says trauma lingers This week  and as a result of the explosion of discussion of the Catholic Church's - Pope Francis' promising first step I believe the fact that Aisha and the Post-Dispatch kept bringing up my name forced the hand of the Archdiocese of St. Louis  and I am forever in their debt.ABUSEThe fact that my abuse occurred isn't in dispute. It was acknowledged in February 2018 (EMPHASIS ADDED).February 5  2018Hi Chris I wanted to respond to you on behalf of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis.  You chose to litigate your claims of sexual abuse by Rev. Leroy Valentine.  YOUR CLAIMS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED by Deacon Phil Hengen  the Archdiocese of Saint Louis and the court system. This matter has been fully settled through litigation and is final. Because your claim has been fully settled and is final THE ARCHDIOCESE OF ST. LOUIS WILL NOT BE RESPONDING TO ANY FURTHER INQUIRIES regarding these claims. Please know that YOU AND ALL VICTIMS OF ABUSE are in my prayers and I do hope that you are able to find peace in the future. I wish you the best.Sandra PriceArchdiocese of St. LouisHowever  as the letter above makes clear  the Archdiocese won't give me any more help. In fact  at least twice before when I have e-mailed them  they have called the police  alleging that I was threatening to hurt myself or someone else.CANCERAt the same time I was fighting the Archdiocese of St. Louis  I was also fighting Cancer (Malignant Melanoma) and I have the scars to prove it.The $9 000 I received from the Archdiocese of St. Louis is nothing compared to just the bills and lost wages I racked up fighting Cancer  much less the toll that sexual abuse took on my family and me.ANY HELP IS APPRECIATEDTreatment of mental health problems isn't cheap. My parents helped me for years  but can no longer afford to. As a result  I have started this GoFundMe campaign to try to get help to pay for...1. Food.2. Therapy to treat my Anxiety  Depression  OCD  PTSD  and Complex-PTSD.3. The thousands of dollars I still owe as a result of my Cancer surgery.4. I have given a number of TV interviews via Skype  but my old 2008 iMac is barely up to the job and needs to be replaced  especially if the volume of interviews I do increases5. I have put together a short video that illustrates what it was like on...- That Day ...and I am considering expanding that into a series or a single  longer video or even movie to help make people aware of the plight of survivors.Please feel free to make a donation in the name of someone and I will memorialize you or them.If you don't know the names of any survivors  M died as a result of his abuse and R is struggling.Thank you.Chris O'Learyivandoesnot@gmail.com314.494.1324,3712,11000,40,34,51,27,13

After a recent stay in the hospital it came to light that Janice would be fighting an almost impossible opponent   Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma which has overcome her stomach and now metastasized into her abdominal cavity .    No one can prepare for this news. So when it was delivered to Janice and Howard a multitude of emotions most obvious FEAR set in . Janice is fighting and with the love and support of her daughter Rebecca Crews whom we know is remaining positive   But the sad truth is that Hospice care is the appropriate care to minimize pain .     Rebecca did not ask for this page to be created instead it was suggested by me a friend and coworker . I understand the ridiculous cost of any form of healthcare . Howard being retired has limited financial resources and all this unexpected burden will eventually rest with him regardless of the outcome .      I ask you to take a minute and consider what even 1 dollar from a lot of people would mean to this family . If you're able to we thank you   if you don't have the mean we still thank you and only ask that you share . Lets together help bring sense of relief .,857,5000,8,17,26,276,4

A trailer to live,https://www.gofundme.com/ampbkg,5,PARADISE,CA,"My name is JD I have been living in Paradise going to college full-time at Butte College to become a teacher. Thursday November the 8th started like any other Thursday I woke up and took my dogs out at 7 am. A hint of smoke began to appear in the sky in the south east  living in Paradise this is normal nothing special. A half an hour later the second source of smoke appeared and started to rain large chunks of ash and burnt debris all over the yard. The mood started to shift  we have been through this before still nothing out of the ordinary living in Paradise. The friends I live with started to pack up their family taking no risks. I have my pets and a small car that can not hold them all so I planned on staying and waiting out the mess. It was slightly after 8 am in the morning and the sky turned black it started to feel different then the normal fire experience. Urgency started to set in I can't stay here my pets can't stay here  I need to go! My friends agree to take two of my dogs and they were off to find safety with their family. I quickly grabbed a couple things the rest of my pets took one last picture of the house and I was out no more than 15 minutes later.  The Pentz rd was already 3 to 4 cars wide with cars and people running down the road fleeing for safety. Panic started to set in as I got onto our road and saw that fire surrounded me on each side. Cars moved slowly funneled by emergency personal down away from the fire or so we thought. I called my friends to tell them I had left  and started receiving texts and calls for concerned friends before service was gone a few moments later. I'm surrounded by people all going through the same fears I was  but I felt so alone and isolated. Traffic quickly turned from a slow movement to a stand still  I was less than a quarter mile from the place I started and not moving.  I sat in my car watching a house I have known for over 20 years burn waiting for my time to get away from all this. The heat from the flames began to be too much for my A/C. The car was getting hot  there were explosions all over coming from all directions  big flashes of light as the transformers and electrical lines fell around me. It felt like I was in a war zone being attacked  I wasn't sure what would happen next. Peoples cars and trucks were catching fire all around me (later i will find out my car was melting too) no one knew what to do. I was stuck here for almost an hour so certain the end was here for me  right now I will die. Sitting thinking my life was over I turned to Bob Marley to ease my mind. I see a white 4runner go around off the road around the cars that had blocked us in  here is my chance! I took my little Hyundai off the road  and past all the vehicles that had piled up in front of me. It wasn't until then that I saw no one had been in those cars anymore  I was waiting for cars that would never move... When I get around and back to the road there is zero visibility and lined with burning cars scattered all over the road. I rushed through them dodging in and out not knowing what is in front of me but knowing what was behind me. I made it through the cars and it became clear! I had made it! I rushed down a side road at 70 miles per hour looking to become safe when I see an EMS crew  I knew there were so many people behind me who probably wouldn't be as lucky as me. I slammed the braked flipped around and told them \there are people stuck back on Billie and Pentz there is no way out  they are trapped\"". They replied with such a worried overwhelmed look at me \""We have people trapped everywhere  we are doing the best we can you need to go\"". I bolt back up the road back to Billie after they told me there was more fire the way I was heading. I stop and tell 2 more groups of Emergency response personal about the people trapped before I head to Clark rd a main exit from Paradise. Clark is a 2 lane road packed 6 cars wide all heading south. My instincts had taken over any small crack I could fit my car into any advantage I could take I did. I drove through parking lots at 50 miles an hour I drove on the side of the road anything I could to pass the gridlock and survive. As I made my way to Skyway to Chico is when it set in how big this fire was. I understood it was on the east side of the little town but when I saw the west side was on fire at the same time it hit me. Skyway is the main road into Chico from Paradise split in two directions both were headed west to Chico. I got into the side that normally heads into Paradise dodging flames again to escape safely. I again dodge cars but this time they were just moving slowly down the hill to Chico  but i was in survival mode and couldn't slow down. I watched as the \""Welcome to Paradise\"" sign caught fire both canyons appeared to be on fire. 90 miles an hour I flew the wrong way down the Skyway then out and far away  I was finally safe. Cell service had come back as soon as I got down the hill minutes seemed like hours until I heard my friends were safe. When I woke up that morning I planned on going to the classroom I observe for school. I never thought the last images I would have in my mind of the town I grew up in would be ones of it being destroyed. Every home that has meant something to me growing up is gone the town is gone  people we are close to are scattered. I don't like asking for help but I need to rebuild a life for me and my pets and being a college student with no savings is difficult. Anything you can do helpsThank you  JD Olsen""",1465,3000,13,49,23,130,5

He is in extreme pain and unable to work a full day anymore. The recovery time for his surgery is 4 months  that’s where we need help! He has no savings or Workers Comp  plus he won’t be able to work and I cannot pay the rent on my salary. We don’t want to end up homeless!We just lost our home to foreclosure and he filed for bankruptcy this last March to make things worse. All we are asking for is the ability to pay our landlord $2 500.00 a month for 4 months  that’s 10K total.  I can pitch in the rest along with his social security check to make up the additional rent money.   Imagine this: if all of our combined friends on Facebook donated $10.00 each that would make the 10K we need.  That's less than it costs for a nice lunch!  Of course if you can give more then that would be awesome!  Please find it in your hearts to give this holiday season so my wonderful husband can get his knee fixed.  Then he can go back to working and we will not have to loose this house too!,1066,10000,21,11,19,51,4
Leo&#x2019;s Promise,https://www.gofundme.com/bf8gsg,4,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,From Friend to Kidney Donor:This is a story about of an extraordinary person with an incredible respect for life.  You see  while most 35-year-old males are anticipating football season or planning their next guys’ night out  Leo Sanchez is busy making good on his promise to donate his kidney to his dear friend and former colleague  Monica Aranda. Leo and Monica met in 2012 when Leo was employed by Albuquerque Public Schools as a long-term substitute at the school where Monica presently  teaches. Monica has been on the kidney transplant list since 2015 due to an inherited and serious renal disorder  Polcystic Kidney Disease. When Leo learned of Monica’s failing health  he knew immediately that he wanted to help in some way. Initially  Leo thought of donating money to Monica and her family to help mitigate the high cost of medical care. Instead  as Leo witnessed Monica’s worsening health condition  he came to a more earnest and definitive conclusion; he would donate his own kidney to Monica. In fact  Leo has never wavered from his promise to Monica. Leo is very candid when he describes why it is so important for him to make this transplant possible for his friend. Simply stated  Leo wishes for Monica to enjoy many more quality years as a daughter  wife  mother  and teacher.Leo’s Commitment to Keep His Promise: After his own health screenings and medical evaluations  Leo discovered that he was not a direct match to Monica’s transplant needs. Although somewhat discouraged  Leo decided long before that he would make good on his promise by cross donating his kidney to another patient nationwide so that Monica may in turn  receive her kidney from a matching donor. With Leo as her cross donor  Monica will be eligible for her kidney transplant soon after Leo undergoes his own surgery to donate his kidney to another patient.Why Your Dollar Donations Are Important:Unfortunately  soon after Leo offered to be a donor for Monica  he was laid off from his full time job at Hewlett Packard. This loss of employment  suspended Leo's surgery since non-cadaver organ donors are required to carry their own medical insurance in order to be considered candidates for organ donor surgery.  Despite this setback  your monetary donations can help Leo keep his promise to Monica. Your Donated Dollars Will Make this Life-Saving Surgery Possible.Leo needs $500 immediately to pay for the required first two months of health insurance so that he may proceed with the kidney donation surgery; he cannot proceed with his surgery until he can secure two months of medical insurance. An additional $1 500 of your donated dollars will then cover 6 additional months of health insurance.$2 000 will help cover medical insurance deductibles  medications and doctor copays.Let's Help Leo Make Good on His Promise to Monica Your generosity will help Leo move to the next step in extending Monica’s life. Until Leo can afford medical insurance to have the surgery to cross donate his kidney  Monica will continue to wait for her transplant for an indefinite amount of time while she continues to suffer setbacks to her health. Leo needs your dollar donations to help cover his medical insurance so that he may undergo this life-saving surgery. Time is of essence in this case. Leo is willing to make his kidney donation so that Monica may in turn receive her life-saving transplant. Your dollars can make this happen if you make a life-saving donation to Leo's Promise GoFundMe campaign today!Why This GoFund Me Campaign is Near and Dear to Me:My name is Isela Imai and I am a teacher at the Albuquerque  NM school where Monica and Leo have impacted the lives of many young children. I have offered to use my comfort with writing and experience with photography to tell this beautiful story of friendship and respect for life through this GoFundMe campaign. This page is dedicated to the life-saving efforts of a genuine and brave young man  Leo Sanchez  and his ultimate act of selflessness as his friend faces a health crisis. I hope that you will make a financial donation to Leo's Promise Campaign and even if you can’t afford one today  please share this GoFundMe  page on your social media sites so that others may read about  donate  and share Leo’s story.,3500,4000,8,88,39,420,8
Change Jimmy Campbell&#x2019;s Life Course,https://www.gofundme.com/bslqcc,8,AMARILLO,TX,Jimmy Campbell  more fondly known to many  as “Hillbilly Jim”  needs our help.   Hillbillly Jim’s truck broke down a couple weeks ago and he subsequently lost his job.  He currently doesn’t have the funds to get his truck repaired or the means to travel anywhere for employment or for assistance.  That’s where Jim needs our help.  All monies raised will be used to repair his truck and to pay past and current bills that are due because of lost wages.I asked Jimmy if I could create this GoFund Me account on his behalf because I could not bear the thought of him selling all his belongings and  losing anymore in his life.  In full disclosure  Hillbilly Jim and I are more acquaintances than anything else.  But I believe that helping each other in times of need is one of the most important things we can all do for each other.  ALL monies raised will go directly to Jimmy to get him back on his feet.  So  he can get back to doing the things he loves - living life  drawing  barbecuing  and smiling again.   Thanks in advance !  Please consider helping - remember any donation amount can help.  Hillbilly Jim always helps others - lets be there for him today.Lori Keating,365,5000,8,7,9,96,7
The Burch Family,https://www.gofundme.com/c1k6hg,0,PHOENIX,AZ,This is my friend Chantelle along with her husband Swift  and their two kids  Sydah who is 6  and Kenzo who is 4 years old. About a year ago my  Swift was diagnosed with Stage 2 Rectal Cancer.  Swift has not been able to work for the past five months and their family finances have suffered tremendously.  He has lost opportunities in his business due to not being able to be present in person and lost several accounts during this process.  They have never been one to openly ask for help for help.  But  after several attempts  and many friends asking permission to start them a Go FundMe  they are finally giving me the go ahead! He has undergone Radiation/Chemo prior to his first surgery.  He then had surgery to remove the cancer and had his entire rectum removed (leaving him with an illiostomy bag) and Praise the Lord it is only temporary.  His surgeon was able to get ALL of the cancer out - this process is just part of the course.  We are Praising God for LIFE! After surgery Swift had a 6 week healing process which he did well with  but could “do” very little due to the healing process his body needed before beginning his next rounds of Chemo. So six weeks after surgery Swift began his 9 rounds of 48 hour Chemo.  He would go in on a Tuesday to receive his drip and stay at his Oncologist for about 5 hours — then he would have his Chemo connected to him through his port on his chest and kept the device in a fanny pack. He would then continue his Chemo at home from Tuesday and would return it to the Oncologist on Thursday afternoon.Every “body” handles sickness differently  as does every body handle Chemo differently.  We were hopeful Swift would still be able to maintain his business and things would be okay.  Swift has been the sole provider for their family as Chantelle has been at home with the kids.  During his treatments it wasn’t possible for her to get work outside of doing what she is starting now with her Bracelet Company  hoping to create a little bit of extra income for the family.  Swift was too weak to manage the kids on his own on most days… Swifts Chemo weeks had him planted on the couch passed out from how hard the drug is  and was on his body. Swift recently completed his final round of his Chemotherapy three weeks ago! (Hallelujah).  He is gaining stamina and strength each day  his is gaining more clarity and getting ready for his final CT Scan on the 27th of August. He is gaining weight back and color is coming back to his face and the look in his eyes aren’t glazed over like they once were. As long as all is clear with his CT Scan on the 27th of August  he will then be scheduled for his Final Surgery at the end of September.  If the CT Scan is indicating something other than normal his surgery will be pushed back another 6 weeks. This surgery will be a reversal surgery and will place all his working parts of his Rectum back together as he will then be able to be without an Ostomy bag!!!! With all of this going on they have accumulated a lot of debt.  Through this journey   and they have had to rely on family and friends and foremost GOD to make it month to month!  We are hoping that the donated funds will help ease the burden for the family for their month to month living and medical expenses. This way they can focus on getting Swift healthy and strong so he can once again provide for his family.   Swift is eager to have this behind him  as well as the whole family!  They believe and trust in God as they walk alongside HIM throughout this season  of their lives.  It has not always been easy   BUT their FAITH is what is seeing them through this season  along with the Many   MANY people standing in the gap for them PRAYING  every step of the way!  We know that everyones financial situation is different  and any amount to help them is greatly appreciated.Thank you everyone for taking the time to follow their story and for Praying for their family!!! They are forever grateful to each and every one of YOU!,20302,40000,22,51,66,177,8

Help Save Mark,https://www.gofundme.com/dk7u2v3q,9,Weyburn,SK,I am conducting this fundraising in behalf of my cousin  Charmie Obradas to help sustain her brother's medical expenses. Last month in October  Mark was suffering from back pains along with painful urination until lately bowel movement was no longer possible. This prompted them to bring him to the hospital. It was found out that he had intestinal blockage. He was initially admitted at Bohol Provincial Hospital where different tests were conducted to trace the root cause of his illness. CT scans and ultrasound were done and lab tests were performed. The doctor detected a lump in his bladder and possible prostate enlargement. They waited for the scheduled surgery but decided to have him transferred to Perpetual Succour Hospital in order to gain better supervision there since Charmie is currently working in Cebu and it would be convenient for her and relatives to visit. That way they can take turns attending to Mark. They waited for the CT scan results from the initial attending hospital in order for the current attending doctor to proceed to the next step. When the results of the CT scan were out  Mark was finally sent to the operating room for his surgery. They had to create an incision on his abdomen to get a sample of the tumor and at the same time perform colostomy to divert the waste which under normal circumstance  is not made possible due to the blockage. On November 5  the diagnosis was released. I am going to quote the diagnostic comments as: Non-hodgkin's lymphoma but PNET  small round cell sarcoma and neuroendocrine tumor were considered as findings. He is recommended for therapies that will help identify the cause of the cancer like immunostaining and to perhaps minimize the spread of the cancer cells. I am not very knowledgeable about these medical terms but based on my research and the doctor's advise  he has to undergo therapy to stop the cancer cells from spreading. We are holding on to the hope when the doctor said Mark's prognosis is good with the right amount of treatment and therapy. His father is an OFW in Qatar and the sad part is he couldn't be here to support them because he has to make money for the family much worse pay for the hospital bills which already totaled to almost Php200k to date. Charmie have two other younger siblings who are still dependent and her pay is not enough to help sustain the family's needs at the moment. We are sincerely knocking on your kind hearts to help us in any amount you can to help with Mark's hospital bills and therapy treatments so he will gain full recovery. Please help us pray that he will be strong enough to conquer this disease. In Jesus name  His ultimate healing will be felt. God bless us all.Direct beneficiary is my cousin  Charmie.

Yeager IVF Fund  ,https://www.gofundme.com/yeagerivffund,0,BROKENARROW,OK,Zach & I have been married for over 10 years now. We are so grateful for the time we have spent together but we feel as though we are missing a piece to our hearts. We have wanted to be parents for as long as we can remember. For us it just isn’t that easy but we know great things don’t always come easy. For medical reasons  Zach has known since he was a kid that he wouldn’t be able to have biological children. We knew that we would need fertility treatment using a donor when the time came. A year after we were married we began our journey to build a family. We started with IUI’s (intrauterine insemination) and fertility medications/monitoring. At that time I was young with no known fertility issues. Unfortunately timing with frozen donor sperm is very difficult. We have been trying to get pregnant for 9 years & have done 15+ IUI’s. We have spent so much money over the years without the help of others. Its been a very hard financial & emotional journey for us.2 years ago we were beyond thrilled & in shock when I finally got a positive pregnancy test! Unfortunately our joy was crushed just as fast when my doctor said I had a biochemical pregnancy (early miscarriage). A few years ago I found out that I had a very low AMH level & antral follicle count for my age. This means I have a low number of potential eggs left. My doctor told us we really need to do IVF for a viable pregnancy. My IVF doctor said our best chance is with multiple egg retrieval cycles. Having more eggs increases our chances. We have wanted to try IVF for a long time but it is extremely expensive & never thought it could be an option for us. Its difficult to expose ourselves & ask for help. Everyone thats knows us knows we always do things on our own & don’t like asking for help. But they say it takes a village . We are humbly asking for family  friends  & kind strangers to help us make our dream come true. Anything helps! Nothing is too small whether its money or prayers! Thanks so much for sharing your love ❤️ Also thank you to our parents for their support: my mom Melody Hurley  my dad Sam Abel  momma in law Lola Vice  & father in law Tim Yeager. Here is a breakdown of costs if you are interested:IVF: 2 egg retrievals & 1 transfer $20 300Medications for 2 retrievals: $6 000-10 000This doesn’t include traveling expenses. We will have to travel to another state at least 3 times. Insurance in Oklahoma doesn’t have fertility coverage. Everything is out of pocket. Maybe one day if we raise infertility awareness more insurance companies change their policies.,1119,26000,8,4,15,159,5

My sister needs a scooter for mobility. Pls help!,https://www.gofundme.com/LetsGetLynnAScooter,0,HUNTINGTONBEACH,CA,Eighteen years ago  my sister Lynn  was diagnosed with Scleroderma and several other auto-immune diseases (they typically go hand-in-hand). Fast forward to today  she is only 57  but the Scleroderma has attacked many of her internal organs (heart  lungs  kidneys  etc...) and has left her bone thin  weak and wobbly on her feet  in need of dialysis and other special treatment.Right after Christmas 2018 she fell and broke her hip. I am raising funds to help get her a mobile  foldable scooter that she can use to get around. After having surgery on her hip  she's in a rehab facility right now  but we're hoping she will get to go home the week of Jan 14  2019.This scooter would give Lynn the mobility and freedom to go outside or even just around the house. Can you imagine not being able to go where you needed to without help? Or with the fear that you may fall and break something? With all the medical bills and only one income  they simply can't afford the scooter.Words can't express how much of a blessing this would be to Lynn and my family. Thank you for anything you can do to help.God bless you.(Scooter we want to purchase.)(My mom  Lynn and me Christmas 2018 right before she fell.)(Lynn at her wedding--me 2nd from left.)(Lynn at my wedding in 2011),1275,3000,16,43,27,115,3

He wouldn’t ask you for help  so we are (with his approval); his family and friends...this will help cover the lack of work while under and recovering surgery and anything after for him or for his boy.Jason has been the best friend and the best laugh to all of us  For me  he harbored me at his grandmas when I ran away at 13 (safely in case my mom reads this) and hitchhiked all the way to Utah to save me from the claws of reform school conformity. He has always stayed my true and loyal friend. I know he’d do and has done the same for you!SO... pony up! ❤️From Christy Maddux;Jason and I have been friends since the fourth grade  our kids have been friends since birth. The fact that this is happening to him breaks my heart and I only wish to make it as easy as possible. All he wants to do is work hard and take care of Kane and he keeps getting thrown curve balls. Jason would do anything for any one of his friends  so if you could please donate to make his life during this process as easy as possible  I know he will appreciate it. I love you Freeball and we are gonna win this fight!!FROM FREEMAN;Two years ago I stopped going out for the most part. Wanted to change things in my life for the positive. Be a better father. Be a better tattooer. Take better care of myself. Stayed off of Facebook for the most part and only posted positive things in the last two years. I got skin cancer then had it removed. I started having issues with my abdomen. My doctor suggested at CT scan. We got the results back and discover in her words \a huge mass\"" in my abdomen. My doctor suggested I see a surgeon which I did this morning. The surgeon said it is Cancer. We need to do more test to confirm this but from the location  size and type of pain he says that he is almost certain it's cancer. He says it is so large that he wants to operate immediately. He has ordered the other tests but wants to operate before the results come in. The mass needs to come out no matter what and doesn't want to take any chances on it spreading. I get my lungs tested tomorrow. He is hopeful because my liver has checked out ok. I go into surgery on Tuesday. I really didn't want to say anything on here. And don't want a pity party by any means. There is just a few people that need to know what's going on with me. I'm in the middle of a book right now and wanted the people that so graciously submitted the art for this project to know that I will get this done on time for the Lady Luck Tattoo Expo. I'm not sure whats going to happen in the next few months. I AM STILL TATTOOING AND TAKING APPOINTMENTS!!! I'm still selling books and Drakes Benefit will still happen. If people would like to help me with the benefit I would appreciate it. However since I don't know whats going on the benefit will be held in Reno.""",11349,40000,20,28,127,380,8

Here is a statement from her... Moments get us down  but people lift us up. And thank goodness we have people. Friends  families  and lovely people everywhere are reaching out and showing us how strong community bonds can be. Thank you for being there and thank you for showing up for us. My husband and I have experienced every emotion under the sun. At first  it is just denial and shock... and that has yet to dissipate. And then  everything I look at reminds me of things I left behind. I have immense guilt for the things I didn’t grab. There were many precious heirlooms from both Kent and my grandparents that can’t be replaced. I know it is just things  but in the same breath  I do place a lot of sentimental value in the things my family has owned through the centuries. I feel I have let down my ancestors. My husband and I bought this home four months ago and had it finally set up perfectly for us. It was my dream come true  and now it’s gone. There really are no more words.#campfire @sarahgarcia @kentgarcia,9099,30000,18,30,122,424,5
Megan&apos;s Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/meganstephens,9,WESTCHESTER,PA,Megan turned 19 in June  2018. A few months prior to that she had a blood test relative to some medical treatment she was undergoing and the doctors were rather alarmed. She was transferred to Children's Hospital in Philadelphia for further testing and they discovered that she had a rare and very serious condition called MDS along with Monosomy 7 and that if untreated it was pretty much guaranteed that it would turn into AML  a very bad form of leukemia - within 6 months.Since then it has been a whirlwind for Megan and her family and she has been in CHOP most of the time. Because of that  her mother  Ginny  and younger sister  Kate are staying with me (Sister/Aunt Cindy). Karl and their dogs travel back and forth weekly for a few days from their home in North Jersey. Chemo started on Tuesday  July 10th and Megan is quite sick - as expected. Chemo will end on Tuesday  July 17th and then they will begin the next phase which is a bone marrow transplant. Megan will be in CHOP for several more months and will then recuperate at my house for 3 months so that she can be close to CHOP.I decided to start a GoFundMe campaign for the family because they are dealing with quite a few extra expenses and it's rough to handle it all.Here are some of the challenges they are dealing with:- Medical expenses - they currently have a stack of bills from multiple hospitals that continues to grow. We estimate that the out of pocket  expenses will end up totaling about $20 000. The hope and expectation is that the bulk of the million dollar plus medical expenses will be covered by insurance.-Traveling - Karl drives back and forth to West Chester  PA from North Jersey weekly. Both Ginny and Karl are traveling back and forth to CHOP and taking turns staying with Megan as she needs a family member with her 24/7. Costs accompanying travel are gas  tolls  parking in downtown Philadelphia  and meals (both on the road as well as at the hospital).- Loss of income for Gin - last year Ginny was an adjunct professor and accompanist at Montclair University. She will not be able to work at least through the end of 2018.- Refitting the home environment as per the doctor's instructions to keep Megan safe from infection as her immune system recovers.You can follow Megan's journey on her CaringBridge site at:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/meganstephens. We so appreciate that a number of you have asked about a GoFundMe campaign and there has been a great outpouring of love and support. From Gin  Karl and all the girls  thank you so much...,10179,25000,7,41,51,619,9
Fight Metastatic Cancer With Bekah,https://www.gofundme.com/fmbs9h7w,1,RICHLAND,WA,In 2012 after barely being married 6 months  Bekah was diagnosed with stage 2 estrogen receptive breast cancer. After almost 3 years in remission  in 2015 she was diagnosed with metastatic disease. The cancer was back and had spread primarily to her bones (lower back and hips). Since that time metastases have also been found on her shoulder blades  skull  ribs  liver  and lungs. The cancer has also mutated to be progesterone receptive as well. The contastant pain and medications to control it prevents her from working. This disease hat taken away the chance to start our own family  and right now adoption is just too expensive. She faces a lifetime of treatments as metastatic cancer is currently incurable. The best hope is to control it and keep it stable to prolong her life as long as possible trying different chemotherapies until they stop working. The financial burden and stress on people like her and their caregivers is tough. Any help you can give to relieve some of that stress is a blessing. We love you all and thank you ro taking the time to read her story. If you've donated or are donating  thank you. We would like to ask you share her story. It is the story of many other metastatic cancer fighters like her. Research is underfunded. As part of our fundraiser for Bekah we plan on donating a portion to Metavivor. Metavivor is a non profit organization focused on metastatic reasearch looking for a cure for metastatic breast cancer. 100% of funds they take in go directly to reasearch efforts.,6718,75000,8,9,92,1000,8

Building a life after the Camp Fire,https://www.gofundme.com/bandcparadisecampfire,2,PARADISE,CA,Hello  all It's hard for Carol and I to ask for help  but we have to. We lost our home in Paradise to the Camp Fire. Carol barely escaped with her life. My childhood home  along with the rest of my hometown  is gone. The only way forward for us is to rebuild our lives. I’m trying to find a house or duplex for rent near Davis. I only recently graduated from UC Davis and we have no savings so we can’t afford to secure a new lease. We need $3000-5000 for deposit and first month’s rent. I think we can get by under our own power after we have housing  but securing a place is the top priority. Any amount you can spare is greatly appreciated.,6005,5000,29,120,54,74,5
Help Rachel Move Forward!,https://www.gofundme.com/unyuckmylungs,0,EMERYVILLE,CA,**February Update: Onward!** Goal: To have this campaign funded by February 28th Hello Community! Thanks for visiting my GoFundMe! The support I've gotten from this has been a big help recovering from the financial hole created from missing a couple weeks of work due to the wildfire smoke + a nasty cold in November.While I've been attempting to move forward now that my health is mostly back to baseline I see that having this campaign be funded would be incredibly helpful to my stability  instead of me just pushing forward alone trying to play catch up. Showing up for myself in asking for support in this way slipped by the wayside when I started working again  but that doesn't mean I don't need the support  it just meant my hole wasn't getting any deeper. Would you be willing to help me fill in this financial hole and move forward? I've decided on a goal date  February 28th  to help me refocus on getting the support I need so I can really  truly move past this and on with my life! Thanks So Much! The Full Story: Your lovely local(ish) accessibility revolutionary needs some support!This past couple of weeks have been quite a challenge for me. I caught a nasty cold right before the smoke that's been hanging over much of California started collecting in the bay where I live. These two things combined to create a very scary symptom:I've been having a hard time breathing. After 2 Dr appointments  the first ended with an inhaler and the second with steroids   antibiotics and a recommendation to rest while my lungs attempt to heal from whatever combination of yuck that is making my oxygen level drop. [image description: A person with short hair and glasses sitting on a couch holding up two pill bottles  one with the large text label 'Steroids!' and the other 'Antibiotics!']The vast majority of my income currently comes from driving Lyft  which I was advised by my doctor not to do. As it is a 'gig' job  I have no benefits or paid sick time.Assuming nothing else goes awry and the meds I'm taking work in a timely fashion  I should be alright to go back to driving next week  but by then I'll have missed out on two weeks of work. In order to make ends meet and be able to pay my rent and my car payment at the beginning of December  I need to raise ~$1 400 by the end of November. (The $1454 is what I need plus my best guess at processing fees) Would you be willing to contribute to this campaign to help me land softly from this unanticipated medical downtime? Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my campaign and considering helping me out. I very much appreciate your support <3 Cheers        ~Rachel More about Rachel: For those of you who do not know me personally  I thought I'd take a minute to tell you more about me rather than just being a random person that needs some help. ~I'm a non-binary trans  superfat  disabled  queer  white person trying to make ends meet while I build a business with the vision of making the world radically inclusive.

Helping Darryl with his medical bills,https://www.gofundme.com/zfe23624,1,DENVER,CO,On July 2018 Darryl was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer after a 3 year battle trying to find a diagnosis for his illness.  It was a little shocking that reguardless of his many visits to several doctors and over 10 blood clots that nobody even bothered to take the time to run any kind of tests to find out what was really going on. He was diagnosed not only with the prostate cancer but also had already traveled to his lymph nodes  bones  and pelvis. He was very quickly started on a aggressive form of chemo therapy which he has almost completed but still has to under go bone treatment with the possability of radiation treatment in the near future. The first few treatments went well but after the third one it started to take its toll on his mental state and he has been trying to deal with the pain caused from the bone cancer.  He has always gone above and beyond for any of his friends in need and never expects anything in return.  Darryl is going through a really bad time dealing with cancer and I would like to see him get better without having  to always worry about bills and money.  he is now unable to work and his disability has yet to be approved. I do what I can but feel Darryl deserves  better. Please help relieve some of the stress from his in his time of need.  After 30 + years of friendship with Darryl  and knowing how stubborn and strong willed he is he will come out on top.,580,10000,6,6,7,96,5

Grandma Dot Camp Fire Relief Fund.,https://www.gofundme.com/ekem4y7g,2,PARADISE,CA,Dot and Pat both lost their homes in the Camp Fire. Dot was enjoying a cup of coffee when her son John told her there was a fire nearby. He told her she had to leave now. She grabbed her dog and left with nothing but the clothes she was wearing. She made it out before the fire trapped people on the only road out. After her husband Bob passed away  she moved to Chico to be closer to her sister Patti. Paradise was her new start at life and now it is all gone. Patti has lived in the canyon for over 42 years in the home her husband was born in. The canyon and Chico are her home. When her husband Danny passed  the bond between the two sisters was stronger than ever. She has a local business downtown and even though her home is gone  she is still going to work everyday. Dot is my my mother in law. She is an amaizing woman. I admire her strength and courage through all of this. She has given her whole life and always is there to help. Now it’s my turn to help her. I’m starting this page to help them both get their lives back to some normalcy. Their homes are completely gone. There is nothing left but ash. Any donation is appreciated. I understand that there are so many people in need  so if you can’t make a donation just share this with others. Thank you.,1200,5000,13,24,14,81,5

Fernando&apos;s Terminal Brain Cancer Diagnosis,https://www.gofundme.com/wpfp3csc,0,LANSING,KS,"Julio Fernando Estrada Guzman (Fernando - aka Mr. Handsome)  born into this world on 26Mar1972. Father  brother  Uncle  Son and Friend  Fernando is truly an all-around wonderful  genuine  kind  caring and hard-working guy....and as you see from the photos - this guy ALWAYS has a smile on his face!!On 25Jul2018 Fernando woke up like any other day; went shopping for household supplies and then off to meet his oldest son  Israel  for dinner. His son noticed he was having difficulty with his speech (slurred and random in content) and trouble walking (right sided weakness). Israel called me  (Kimberly the ex-wife)  and told me what was happening. Working in healthcare for years I right away came to the conclusion he was having a stroke and directed them to the nearest emergency room - immediately. It was there that a scan was performed and subsequently a large mass in his left frontal lobe was discovered. A tumor. A tumor in the left frontal lobe of his brain.... these words were deafening…and will haunt our family for a lifetime...Over the course of the next 10 days we will have been to three hospitals and Fernando was \tentatively\"" diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). After a 7-hour manual debulking and resection brain surgery performed at KU  it was learned through tumor tissue analysis that Fernando’s tumor was the high-grade IDH-wildtype…the very worst type of GBM you can get. He was terminal…literally the worst of the worst...incurable....given 14 months to live of which we have already lived 3 months of those 14....and he is unfortunately progressing too fast. After 30 fractions of radiation and 6 weeks of Temodar (chemo) the tumor grew back (in week 3 actually). The oncologist stopped the Temodar after post 2 weeks after radiation due to ineffectiveness and he is now receiving Avastin infusions every other week in its place. The latest MRI performed on 05Nov2018 showed stable disease for now  although there is a lot of swelling around the cavity of the first tumor which could be an indication of spreading - but until the oncologist says progressive disease - we fight.To help everyone understand  glioblastomas are malignant Grade IV tumors  where a large portion of tumor cells are reproducing and dividing at any given time (normal-healthy brain cells do not split and divide…ever). These glioblastomas are nourished by an ample and abnormal tumor vessel blood supply. The tumor is predominantly made up of abnormal astrocytic cells  but also contain a mix of different cell types (including blood vessels) and areas of dead cells (necrosis). Glioblastomas are infiltrative and invade into nearby regions of the brain. They can also sometimes spread to the opposite side of the brain through connection fibers (corpus callosum). It is exceedingly rare for glioblastomas to spread outside of the brain.Glioblastomas may arise de novo  meaning they begin as a Grade IV tumor with no evidence of a lower grade precursor. De novo tumors are the most common form of glioblastoma and tend to be more aggressive. Glioblastomas are usually diagnosed as either IDH-wildtype or IDH-mutant. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas are more common  tend to be more aggressive  and have worse prognosis than IDH-mutant glioblastomas.  When Fernando woke up in ICU the next day after surgery  we learned even though great measures were taken by the surgeons to preserve function  the right side of his body was severely and permanently impaired due to the location within the brain of the tumor that was removed - his tumor rested upon his motor strip. To make things even worse  as if possible  he had also been left with expressive aphasia (the inability to express verbally his words). I am a silver lining person and considering we only lost function of the right side and not all function  and when given time he can speak a little...although sometimes it's hard to understand him. We do indeed consider ourselves incredibly blessed in the big scheme of things.After 3 days in ICU  30 days in the hospital and 7 days in physical rehab re-learning how to do things such as walking  talking  feeding  bathing and dressing himself  he was finally released. Our family forever broken  knowing our loved one is dying  without the ability to work  walk or perform most of his activities of daily living  without health insurance  without a savings and without a home to go to  I took responsibility and took him to my home to provide care  understanding until he dies  he will now and forever need assistance. Insult to injury   I was restructured out of my job when he first got sick  but with a small severance...which is now gone. Maybe some of you are asking who I am....I am the ex-wife  Kimberly. I realized when Fernando first got sick  he had grown quite a network of friends we (myself and our kids) had never met. Fernando and I  have remained on good terms since our divorce 9 years ago. Fernando is  and always has been  an extraordinary father  and for this   I felt compelled to help him (reality is there isn't/wasn't anyone else). I am helping him not just for him  but also for our 4 children. Now that he is sick  I have also moved his mother into my home (regarding the day to day care I couldn't do this without her). I am caring for both of them and our 3 remaining children that live at home financially and all on my own; which brings me to this desperate plea for assistance. Anyone that knows me knows that I never ask anyone for anything  but this has proven to be so much bigger than me. There are mounting medical bills at this point   and although KU has been amazing  there are times when we must pay first to receive services. As you can imagine  Fernando is also taking A LOT of medications. Some  like chemo  I was able to obtain for free through the patient assistance programs with the pharmaceutical companies. All others though I pay for out of pocket every month. I have flown his mother back and forth to California several times as well as this is where she technically lives. She lives on social security and is a diabetic...so I also pay for her medications too.  I am struggling. Without a steady job and payroll for the first time in...forever  (I have a small contract CRA job that has yet to pay me once since I started on October 7th even after I literally begged for a more timely payroll #heartless#)...I have now started to struggle with the household bills...and it's the holiday season as too....Forward looking to his death  which is unfortunately the grim reality; how will I ever begin to pay for this too? What does that even look like? Literally I am so overwhelmed and I cry every single day. Not sleeping. A while back in conversation with a friend of Fernando  starting this GoFundMe page was mentioned but I said no way! Reality check for me is that I/we need help. I cannot do this any longer on my own. There you have it - this is our story. If you have the ability to help Fernando and our family in this time of devastation  please know it is accepted with the sincerest of appreciation and gratitude. Every bit of assistance received will make a difference.  Also  please know that visitors are always welcome in my home. As time passes  we see less and less of people that we know love us. Please make time. Tomorrow is never promised for any of us. I have learned through this experience that sometimes I think people just don't know what to say....I know its hard...but just come hang out and say nothing - your presence is literally everything and means more to us than you will ever know. Thank you so much and blessings to all.Sincerely on behalf of Julio Fernando Estrada The Turner-Obregon Family""",1050,35000,8,3,13,139,5
Help Bo help Carol,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpBoHelpCarol,0,OKLAHOMACITY,OK,Meet Bo and his wife of over 30 years  Carol.     Bo has an aggressive form of brain cancer and he's worried about Carol's future. Can you donate just $25 to help them?     Bo has spent his whole life helping others. He worked for 25 years for the Oklahoma City Police Department and tells me that he didn't think he would survive the job since he worked undercover narcotics and worked many intense situations like all of our police do these days. Then he came to work at our hospital about seven years ago and became the director of public safety. Everyone who has worked with Bo says the same thing: we are all better for knowing him and are all safer! He gets particulary protective of our nurses and doctors and when put in harm's way  he's always working to make sure we are all safe.     I had to fight Bo to put this page up (he's humble and proud) and now it seems like it is losing steam - there has been very little activity since all of his friends and family have donated so we need to keep this going! He's a humble man and didn't want to admit that he needed some security in his life so Carol feels it in hers. They are a beautiful family dealing with the fight of a lifetime. Please help in any way you can and please spread the word.      May your kindness be returned many times back to you. Thank you for your consideration.,22685,75000,17,30,189,757,14

Stacys  Strength,https://www.gofundme.com/stacystrength0403,7,PAWPAW,WV,Hello everyone. My name is Jessica Arnsberger and doing something like this is very new to me. My sister is in the profile picture above (in the middle). Her name is Stacy. She is a beautiful  smart  kind-hearted woman who has been through a lot. When she was 20 yrs of age she started showing signs and symptoms of a very rare condition. After a long time of testing and possible solutions  she finally received a diagnosis called Fredricks Ataxia. This is a very rare disease that progresses fast. My sister went from walking/running at age 18  to a walker at age 23  to walker/ wheelchair at age 27. Her motor functioning and overall health have declined rapidly over the years and now she is in need of health care assistance.  Even though my sister has this disease she has pushed through school and graduated college! She has had a beautiful baby girl (my niece) that is now 8 years old. She is a great mother. She does have a significant other that works. But living with one income has been hard and stressful and I am trying to help prepare my sister with more stability in the future. These donations will go towards in-home therapy and longer health care assistance not covered by insurance.  And a facility in the future. Money isn't everything so if you all have advice or support groups you know of or can relate please send kinds words.,465,10000,9,5,5,44,6

Susan has been in pain for a long time because she is on Social security and cannot afford the ridiculous fees to even have a tooth  surgically removed.  The little dental coverage she does have only covers a yearly Xray and exam which is why she needs help.  Sadly enough even with past Dental work from years ago her teeth are a major health issue not from neglect but  genetics.I am asking you to please consider helping someone who has always put others before herself.

Melanie&apos;s Birth- Baby came early- living in NICU,https://www.gofundme.com/melanieandbaby,0,AUSTIN,TX,Latest Update-3/08- Ume is up to almost 4 lbs!!She has been doing remarkably well. Her main challenges have been respiratory..she has gone on and off a breathing ventilator many times  as well as iv for antibiotics. She is not using those now and is getting oxygen from a cpap machine  which is a big step as it means she is breathing on her own! The doctors reminded me that usually she would not be needing her lungs to be working yet..so this type of respiratory issues are pretty normal. Now that the breathing tube is out there will be less infections and need for antibiotics hopefully. These changes also have enabled me to Hold her finally! I am feeling so great about that step forward.  She has also had new heart and brain scans which are showing all good things now!I am going to the hospital daily  pumping milk  trying to focus on the good aspects of this journey. It is easy to feel like I am in another world. But truly  support and stories from friends and family are saving my soul through this all! Hoping to get to go back to work in some capacity very soon! With love  MelDear Friends and Family Update! Ume (pronounced oomee)  was born! She was 24.5 weeks and 1 lb 14 oz at birth.She is doing really well. They did not expect her to make it at first  as she was having trouble with oxygen and has an infection. But she had a miraculous turnaround and is starting to thrive! I had prepared myself for the worst  so hearing that news was probably the most incredible thing i have ever experienced! The team here who delivered her was amazing..i am truly blessed to be at St. David's.Ume will be living here in NICU for at least a few months to fully develop before coming home. As heartbreaking as it feels  i am happy she will be so well cared for. I myself will be getting discharged in the next couple days to go home!! as long as things look good.I had a c-section so i will be out of commission still for quite a few weeks healing before i can return to work. I will also be coming to the hospital daily to deliver milk to Ume and be with her. Your contributions have helped so much to lessen our family's stress about paying for her expenses and supplies while i am still healing up.I love you all so much! I am seriously thinking of you all while i am in here and it gives me strength!Melanie RoseI am having a baby girl!  A time of great joy in most cases. However  my water broke this week at only 5 months along. I got to the hospital just in time to keep from going into labor.  We are stable for now thank goodness. But I am going to be in the hospital until the baby is born..up to 2 1/2 months! This is the best we can hope for; as the longer she stays inside me  the less birth and developmental issues she will have. I expected to have many more months of work to save money and collect supplies needed for the baby. That is all out of my hands now. I am raising money for medical expenses and supplies for a possible premature baby.  Preemies need special items I have not been able to plan for or collect.

Bill Bishop 911 Call,https://www.gofundme.com/d6ysngqk,8,CULLOWHEE,NC,As many of you know by now on Saturday 10/27/18 Bill had a massive stroke he remains at this time in Mission Hospital in ICU.  Hopefully with God's help and the support of his wonderful wife DeeDee he will make a full recovery  but it is going to be  long and difficult road with many expenses attached.  Bill has served Jackson County for years with 911 services as well as being a friend to all.  Bill Bishop truly never met a stranger quick with a smile and a tall tale of some type for everyone he came in contact with.  As for his wife DeeDee she is an absolute joy to know  and serves as stylist  counselor  adviser  and friend to any one who sits in her chair at Southern Style Salon but also as a stylist she does not get any paid leave so that adds to the financial burden as she wants to be by Bill's side as often as she can.  The phrase to know them is to love them sums up Bill and DeeDee Bishop.  So I ask you please to donate if you can and remember them in your prayers as they begin this long journey.,3150,2000,8,158,40,403,6
Help after theft and accident,https://www.gofundme.com/cs8xcpmc,5,BOCARATON,FL,We were robbed of most of our funds by family members.

Addi Strong,https://www.gofundme.com/prj5wqf8,1,LULA,GA,My name is Lindsay and I'm reaching out to you all from Northeast Georgia in hopes of raising funds and obtaining prayer for my dear friends of nearly 20 years  Warren and Leanne Masten. Their niece  Addi  whom they're raising  has been diagnosed with cancer. The funds we raise will be used to alleviate any uncovered medical expenses   travel expenses  and help supplement the income the Mastens will not receive due to missing work being with Addi in the hospital. Addi is a beautiful  happy 2-year old girl who was recently diagnosed with neuroblastoma (a rare cancer often diagnosed first in the adrenal glands atop the kidneys).  Addi was rushed to the ER after her aunt and uncle (Leanne & Warren Masten) became concerned that she was experiencing pain in her side.  While at Scottish Rite  doctors found a mass the size of an apple on one of Addi's kidneys  along with another spot on one of her lungs.  It has been determined that Addi has neuroblastoma and will need chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before it can be removed.  Addi's family is currently awaiting a full-body scan that will determine if the cancer has metastasized to other regions of her body.  Medical Professionals haven't provided the family with a timeline of how long she will be in the hospital.  Leanne has used all of her paid time off and Warren is working as many shifts as possible to make up for this.  Addi needs her LaLa and WaWa with her  so this campaign will help to relieve some of burden of them missing work to be with Addi.  Any amount you are willing to donate is appreciated and beneficial.  Let's come together in prayer and support of Addi and her family during this trying time!,85340,100000,0,85,1,19000,8
Jamison&#x2019;s Journey with Burkitt Lym.,https://www.gofundme.com/jmjawbg4,9,WETUMPKA,AL,On October 5th  2018  Jamison woke up with a golf ball size lump on the side of his neck. Mom and dad assumed it was a swollen lymph node and took him to the doctor for a checkup. The doctor assumed the same and we started antibiotics  though they didn’t help and the lump continued to grow. 13 days later  after various visits to ENT doctors and eventually the children’s hospital ER  we received the official diagnoses of Lymphoma. The pathology results were Burkitt Lymphoma  a type of fast growing and extremely aggressive lymphoma  and the doctors went into overdrive.  Chemotherapy both intrathecally and through the recently placed port began.Mom and dad are extremely blessed that dad’s active duty status with the military allows him to be enrolled with TriCare  meaning that most of our medical care is covered. However  the costs of having two households are rising. Mom and dad are staying at the hospital while grandma stays with brother and sister  and even being as frugal as possible is still expensive. We’re hoping to raise enough to at least supplement our income to keep our anxieties about money to a minimum. We live 100 miles away from the hospital  so as you can imagine  even gas costs have been crazy! Anything and everything is appreciated. I know there have been requests for the kids to have an amazon list of some toys for Christmas  so I’ve included that as well. Thank you so much for keeping our family in your thoughts during this crazy journey. Kiddo’s Christmas wishlist,745,1000,5,75,13,217,5
Donna Jones disaster relief,https://www.gofundme.com/donnajonescc,2,ASHLAND,AL,It is the time for giving thanks. The holidays are meant for being thankful  sharing cheer and being close to those you love. There are times where the holidays can be hard for some and that time is now. Donna Jones lost her house during a fire last night. She and her kids have lost the roof over there heads so close to the holidays. She works as a correctional officer at the Clay County Sheriff's Office and most importantly is a loving and caring member of our Clay county community. She has been there for others when they needed her in a time of need and we at the Clay County Sheriff's Office ask that our community be there for her. I have set a goal of $5000 dollars keeping in mind that she will need to find a house to rent  pay for the utilities and provide for her children including Christmas coming up. The reason the goal is set at $5500 is because Go Fund Me charges 2.9% at the time the funds are withdrawn and they charge .30 cents for each donation  so I wanted to make sure we hit the $5000 dollar mark. Please everyone take time out of your day to pray for her and her family and donate for a great cause! The Clay County Sheriff's Office thanks everyone who participates!,530,5500,5,10,8,158,5
Scientology Cult Survivor: Help,https://www.gofundme.com/vkkajv64,0,ANAHEIM,CA,"Hi  my name is Justin Rybacki and I am a survivor of the cult known as the Church of Scientology. I was born into the cult  as were many of my siblings  and it took nearly 30 years to break free of their shackles.At the age of 12 my parents signed me over to the Sea Organization (group brainwashed into religious slavery). For the next three months my life was hard labor  all day every day  living in constant fear of being discovered as gay  with little food and NO SCHOOL. When I finally broke down and said I wanted to leave  I was berated in front of my peers daily for things such as \missing my mommy \"" “abandoning and failing all of humanity in its most dire time of need ” then assigned grueling work. At the age of 12 I really took it to heart  it was an absolutely soul crushing feeling. I remember having to clean \""rats alley ” a small damp crawl space on top of a giant freezer. It was in the basement and I was armed with nothing but a flashlight and a garden hose. I often get flashbacks of the bugs crawling all over me  being bitten  and crying and begging for an additional shower that day.My parents found out I was gay when I was 14. They reported me; my own mother turned me in. I was subjected to gay conversion tactics  disguised as a ‘religious confessional ’ because Scientology doesn’t tolerate homosexuality. I spent 20-40 hours a week hooked up to a machine — Scientology’s e-meter — that I was told could read my thoughts  and I was interrogated about my sexual behavior.At 16  I was coerced to be a cult spy  which involved working with private detectives to follow ‘enemies’ of Scientology at public events. I was instructed to tail two women who were wearing shirts with confidential cult secrets printed on the back. I had to watch where they were going — report movements over walkie talkies — all the while terrified I might accidentally read the backs of their shirts... and die! I thought reading the confidential material could kill me  or give me cancer. I was told to sign documentation saying if I revealed this to anyone  they would fine me $50 000.My parents chose the cult over me  and have told me they always will. They made it very clear that my opinions and feelings are not what motivate them to make decisions in their lives — what does  and always will  are the dogmatic principles of Scientology. I struggle with what I now know is major depressive disorder. Being disconnected from and rejected by my parents and siblings has only added to my feelings of being a complete failure.At least I survived it. I can't say the same for all of my friends. One of my best friends who I won’t name in this plea for help (it's their family's choice to share that entire story) was a child in the Sea Organization  too. While trying to escape he was followed and kidnapped. He was forcibly thrown into a van and brought back to the Sea Organization base. He told me it haunted his mind. He took his own life some years ago. He was one of the smartest people I've ever met. My love for technology and video games is deeply influenced by the time in life I did share with him. I am saddened he couldn't take the world anymore; couldn't endure the demonic past. I understand why he ended his suffering. I don't judge or blame him  I just wish something more had been done to help him before it was too late. A few weeks ago another childhood friend took her own life; she was very young  in her mid-twenties. It terrifies me that the friends I have grown up with are killing themselves. Being a gay person I am at an even higher risk for mental illness  and it is a battle every day.I’m lucky to have had friends helping me through this process. I've been a ghost for months  a shell of my previous self  rebuilding who I am and doing a lot of soul searching. I have really grown as a gay person: dating  having fun  loving  being heartbroken — still not giving up on sharing my love. I am doing everything in my power to remove myself from the cult  including removing myself from Scientology and those who would try to pull me back in; getting my car in proper shape to earn money via rideshare; and getting caught up on car payments  registration and insurance. But I need more help. It's a make or break point for me: succumb to my demons  my struggles  my debt  financial challenges... or rise above and ask for help from others to put all of this behind me. I just need some stability.My current living arrangement is staying on a friend’s couch  in a cockroach-infested apartment over an hour away from good areas to work  and my boyfriend. I am currently making money by driving for Lyft and Uber  but the ends just aren’t meeting right now. My credit is shot. I had a tire blowout last week  which set me back work hours and financially. I am BARELY scraping by  and I am afraid of being in a situation where one mishap could have me out of a source of income.I am fully aware and accept the fact that this campaign may make the ‘church’ come after me  but I have to do what is best for me; not live in fear of what they may or may not do. I need your help  even if all you can do is share this post. I need to tell my story.I don’t know everything I need yet  but I do know that trying to survive on the outside while most of my family is still inside has caused bills and credit cards to stack up  which has destroyed my credit. Because of my destroyed credit  I know I will need a larger deposit on a safer place to live (several months of rent). I am currently living in the area that I grew up in  and was subjected to Scientology and it's abusive practices — these traumatic experiences regularly haunt me.I have a roommate lined up to get an apartment with me out of state  but they are not in a position to financially support me (and I wouldn't expect that). I have three tires that really need to be replaced as soon as possible. I need to register my car in another state so I can continue working for Lyft / Uber  not to mention gas to get out there. At this time I only plan on taking what I can fit in my car. I will be starting my life over with nearly nothing but a car payment.I have found a therapist that I like  and have had two sessions with them. It gives me hope. It is also very expensive  more than my car payment  and this is with a generous discount from the therapist . Scientology has made me believe there is something deeply wrong with me. I am doing my best to challenge those thoughts  but I cannot do it alone and without support. I need to be working with qualified professionals.Please know that I am only asking this as a last resort. Thank you for your time  and thank you for reading and sharing my story.""",5487,10000,18,55,77,290,12
Chess&apos; Top Surgery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/chesstopsurgery,6,LAWRENCE,KS,My name is Chess  and I’ve been on hormones since June 4th  2015. I’ve been contemplating doing this for officially over 3 years now and it’s finally time. I’ve tried so hard in the last 3 years to be able to save up for this oppurtunity but every time I save up to at least a thousand  I end up having to use it for moving expenses or rent/bills. I didn’t realize how hard it would be to save up as much as I would need to just to feel comfortable in my own skin. I’m tired of constricting my body with binders and kt tape expenses add up. Every year I’ve told myself “maybe this year will be the year” and so far I’ve been wrong. I’ve found my preferred surgeon  Dr. Elliot Jacobs in New York City. He developed a technique called “Minimal Scar Top Surgery” for smaller chested people. The problem with this  is that the surgery he’d perform would be 11 000 dollars. In a link I will include at the bottom  it says“The price includes surgeon fees  anesthesia  operating room fees  implants  garments  all follow up care  plus revision (if indicated) surgical fee within the first year.” He also does free in person consultations (which would involve taking a trip up there at some point for a consultation) I’ve found that this procedure and surgeon would be the best option for me  but I can’t afford it all on my own unfortunately.  If anyone could help even just a little bit  I would be immensely grateful and appreciative. Thank you for taking the time to read this. The link for more information on this surgeon and procedure is below! The surgeon:  https://www.topsurgery.net/surgeons/dr-elliot-jacobs.htmThe procedure:  https://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/minimal-scar-top-surgery.htm,340,11000,7,3,14,160,9

Car accident support fund,https://www.gofundme.com/n8m68urg,5,LASVEGAS,NV,Hello all. We are Scott and Derrick Baskerville  the sons of Jennifer Jones  and we are trying to raise money for a safe and reliable car after hers was totaled in an accident. We thank you for the time to read about recent events surrounding the horrific car accident our mother  Jennifer Jones  was in. She was on her way to work when the accident happened. She was making a left turn which was mostly completed when a driver  trying to beat the light  hit her on the middle/rear passenger side of her car. She was hit by a truck and the collision was so hard that it spun her car around and almost flipped it over. Thankfully she only suffered a few bumps  bruises  and scratches. She was taken to the hospital and was fortunate that she suffered no broken bones or internal damage. However  due to her injuries she missed several days of work.Her car was completely totaled as the truck was traveling at a high rate of speed in order to beat the light. Like we stated earlier  we are extremely grateful that she wasn't seriously injured or worse.She does have the option to take the bus to work  but our concern is after she gets off work at 3:00 a.m. We are worried about her safety while waiting for a bus and then the walk home from the nearest stop.Our mom has struggled her entire life raising us  including working in some unsavory jobs to support us. Even after we reached adulthood  she was always there for us if we needed money  temporary housing  guidance and sound advice. She's the type of person who will help any of her friends and not ask anything in return as she understands sometimes life hits a snag.Now it is our turn to take care of her. If she knew what we are doing she would be extremely embarrassed. What we are asking for are donations to help her get a sound  reliable car in good condition. (we don't want her worry about any breakdowns) Our goal is $3 000 which she can use as a down payment on a newer car  or possibly purchase a used one with the reliability we mentioned earlier. We are sincerely hoping we can reach our goal in a short period of time because  again  the idea of her having to get home safely after work at 3:00 is a huge concern for us.We want to thank you in advance for anything you are able to donate to help her out. We love our mom dearly and we want to help her out.Sincerely Scott and Derrick Baskerville.,670,3000,8,22,8,85,5

Carter Mae&apos;s Wilms Wishes,https://www.gofundme.com/e2n5jxbw,1,DURHAM,NC,Carter Mae is a spunky kid. Almost 5  she has a thing for Elsa  and can belt out a pretty darn good rendition of Let It Go. She also loves hanging with her big brother  AP  riding bikes  and playing cashier. She had just finished up her first week of Pre-K. School is also one of her favorite things. On September 8  2018  Carter Mae was diagnosed with Stage 4 Wilm's Tumor  after a dramatic presentation to the ED.  Kinda like Carter Mae does... She has metastasis to her liver  lungs  and heart. The primary tumor envelops her entire left kidney and extends up her inferior vena cava into her atrium. Only 3-4% of Wilms Tumor kids have this type of cardiac involvement. She has already been hospitalized twice for the initial diagnosis and then complications from chemotherapy. She has a planned admission for surgical resection of the entire left kidney + as much tumor as possible. After nephrectomy  she will continue chemotherapy and receive a course of radiation. Carter Mae is looking at months of clinic visits and hospitalizations. The intent of these funds will be used to pay copays and other medical costs.  While we are fortunate to be insured  there are still many costs associated with a childhood cancer diagnosis. Cancer is expensive  y’all. The above goal reflects already incurred costs and planned medical care  not including any additional complications. She’s one tough  cookie  so here’s hoping things will be smooth sailing after the dust settles.,6400,20000,33,32,45,48,7
Help 5 Children in a Crisis,https://www.gofundme.com/wrn78nu4,0,MONTGOMERY,IL,Due to mental illness  my husband was hospitalized in May of 2018 because he became a danger to the children. He is moving into his own housing so he can take care of his own needs. He plans to divorce as he needs all of his disability money for his own housing. He will no longer be able to pay any of the household bills or take any responsibility as he has left the family to take care of his mental health and has no income. My 13 year old son once had severe Autism. He has improved but I'm not done yet! I'm a Son-Rise mom and have worked with him myself and had to quit working outside the home. It's hard to find babysitters for him and he is not ready for a public school setting at this time. My parents and siblings have passed and my in laws have no interest in whether or not I can continue to provide and protect these 5 incredible kids I love with my whole heart. I'm doing everything I can to find a job at home and in the meantime  I need to pay the bills and help my children so they can have what they need. I need funds so I can continue to homeschool because even with a part-time job  I'm not going to be able to make enough on my own even if I get government program assistance. I'm talking about the mortgage  food  utilities  clothing and basic needs. Our van has almost 200K miles. A fund would ensure that I can protect and provide on my own  take care of household problems when they occur and continue to work with my son who requires supplements and a special diet no programs cover. I am always looking for high energy Son-Rise volunteers to work with my son who has Autism one to one as well. I need the funds within the next 3 months to show I can prove that I have the means to do this on my own.,4320,50000,21,9,14,48,9
Debbie&apos;s Cancer Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/57n7qwc4,1,TORRANCE,CA,Let me tell you about this beautiful  compassionate woman  Debbie. She is a clinical social worker  who has for many years  given of herself to help others both in work and through her church. Debbie has improved the lives of at-risk teens  foster children  and is currently working as a hospice social worker. She sits with patients and their family members as they are dying  offering guidance and comfort. Debbie now needs our help. Two years ago she was diagnosed with a Stage III very rare form of cancer -Leiomyosarcoma.. A huge tumor was removed at that time. Debbie lost an adrenal gland but the surgeon was able to save her kidney  aorta  pancreas  and intestines   to which the tumor had adhered. Chemotherapy and radiation were deemed to be ineffective against this rare sarcoma as doctor's feared that cells were elsewhere since the sarcoma had metastatic activity. Because chemotherapy was considered to be ineffective  Debbie began holistic treatment  which was successful in keeping the cancer from growing for a period of time.  A recent liver biopsy has shown the cancer has multiplied and is most likely throughout her body. The oncologist has given her 2 yrs or less to live. Although chemotherapy and radiation is not effective against this Sarcoma  medical insurance will not cover alternative treatment programs.The current body of Homeopathic medicine agrees that treatment should include a variety of modalities designed to increase immune system functioning  increase the body's ability to recognize and attack the cancer cells  while leaving as many healthy cells of the body intact. Debbie’s goal is to raise funds for aggressive alternative treatments that can again place the cancer cells in dormancy  or better yet  shrink or eradicate the cells. Please help us support her. The world is a better place with Debbie able to continue spreading her loving and compassionate presence with others.Thank you  Fundraising Team Members,1015,24500,4,4,13,280,8

Marine and Family man with Brain tumors,https://www.gofundme.com/9htdfx7g,1,STEPHENVILLE,TX,Update 3/20/19: The biopsy was sent off to  the Mayo clinic and the diagnosis was changed to Ewing Sarcoma. This is still a rare cancer  it is described as a cancerous tumor that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones (soft tissue). As of today Justin finished his 6weeks of Radiation and got to ring the bell! He will get to go home for 4weeks and will be working on getting his strength back during this time. In 4weeks they will do a MRI and CT scan to see how the Chemo and Radiation did  prayers are still greatly appreciated <3Our family can not thank everyone enough for all the support  love and prayers  we have been truly blessed by all of you. Update 1/23/19: We have been approved at MD Anderson  the Diagnosis is a very rare cancer. We have up'd the donation amount because we do not know how long Justin will be out of work or how much this treatment is going to cost. Our Family is so grateful to all of those that are able to help.  We are asking for help from all of our family  friends   the communities around us and the Country he so selflessly helped defend. Justin is an incredible person and him and his family are in need of our support at this time. Justin Monk is a Marine who is a devoted Christian  Father  Husband  Son and Brother who has become ill. About 6 weeks ago Justin was experiencing Vertigo and had started having horrible headaches. He went to the ER and had an MRI done to find out he has multiple tumors on his Brain and down his Spine. The Dr's are working very hard to figure out what kind of tumors they are but we are still waiting on test results to come back.

Haunted by a Train Wreck,https://www.gofundme.com/drfegq3w,0,DULUTH,GA,One of the hardest things I have ever written or had to do -- this. I am one that keeps things inside and have NEVER been one to ask for help  I even have a hard time accepting little favors from others. However  my mom and I are in a desperate situation and need help now more than ever   A little over 1 year ago a tragic accident occurred resulting in immediate life changes physically  mentally  emotionally and financially - well  in every possible way for my mom  stepdad (a tow truck driver) and I. Last October Lamar  my stepdad  was dispatched to pull a car stuck on the railroad track off. The train station told the Gwinnett County Police Officer they shut the tracks down and it was “safe to proceed”  and then gave Lamar the “go-ahead” to load the car. With surrounding commotion  noises  tow truck running  everyone’s focus on the car  officer speaking to the driver  etc. the unexpected happened - here comes an Amtrak train around the corner. The train conductor didn’t blow the horn when supposed to so no one knew a train was traveling 70+ mph and within seconds from them until the crossing guard began beeping  lights were flashing and arms were coming down. The officer yelled for everyone to run but my stepdad didn’t hear him. He had just got done backing the truck up when he saw the crossing guard blinking all lit up. As he was jumping out of his truck to run  the train plowed into the car flipping tow truck  and luckily throwing Lamar away from it rather than truck landing on him. Luckily  he walked away with a broken pelvis  fractured elbow and knee  bruised ribs and scrapes. I attached a link to one article I could find. Although my mom wasn’t financially prepared  she wound up having to retire early to take him to all of his surgeries  appointments (almost daily)  and care for him at home since he couldn’t walk for months and hasn’t been back to work. The past couple months have been very  VERY  HARD to navigate financially and has finally taken its toll. All of our options have run out. Lamar was receiving worker’s compensation but that ended a couple months ago when it was decided he couldn’t return to strenuous work. That said social security is not enough to live on. I have done everything I could do while not working myself to help her financially while I was also trying to get by and pay MY bills. I cashed out my savings account and 401k from my previous job  and will be starting a new one hopefully in December. My mom also returned to work to remedy the situation  but we all know employers hold the 1st check so it will be about 5 weeks before she gets one. I have done things to reduce the bills. I got rid of the $200+ a month cable bill and set up Hulu. Once my mom and I get some paychecks coming in we will be able to get back on our feet. Until then  I need to ask for help. We/I have never been in this situation so I find this extremely hard  especially when I have always been on the other end helping those that are in my shoes. I never realized just how much bills add up to and how quickly they come due. Every bill is a month late  almost two. It is a terrible feeling when thoughts are running through your mind every second of every day wondering how you are going to pay for this  or that. How you and your pets are going to eat. What you will do when the little bit of gas you have in your tank runs out and you need more in order to get back and forth to work  what about power and my car insurance?  How I am going get my monthly prescriptions … everything. I cannot put into words the scared  sad  sick feelings and emotions I am experiencing. I sincerely appreciate anyone that took the time to read this and any help you can give  even if $1  it would help at this point  or words of encouragement.,1485,2500,26,59,27,48,5

HOPE FOR PEDIATRIC STROKE-AMELIA,https://www.gofundme.com/vaknzqvv,0,COMFORT,TX,Your daughter has suffered a stroke.” Is not something I ever imagined someone would tell me. It felt like my heart was ripped out and torn into a million pieces. All the plans  excitement  joy we had turned into worry and painful heartache. I had a healthy pregnancy with no complications. On Saturday September 9th 2017 I arrived at the hospital around 7pm because I was having contractions about 3 minutes apart. I was admitted and placed in a room. The night was long. Amelia started having variable and late deccerlations at times. The CNM came in and told us Amelia may be holding on to her cord  so she wanted to try an Amnioinfusion. By that time  I just wanted Amelia out. We decided to try it. The amnioinfusion did not work. Amelia was still in fetal distress. I felt so droggy from the epidural. I was placed on oxygen later that night. I was told the oxygen was for her  not me. They wanted to make sure she was getting enough. It wasn’t until around 4:30 a.m. a doctor came in and said I need to have a c-section. I was terrified. This was not what I had in mind. They called the staff in (the hospital didn’t have staff on site) to perform a c section. I was taken to the OR around 6 am and gave birth to Amelia at 6:31 am on September 10th. Amelia had her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck and legs. Her Apgar score was 2  and 8 respectively. Apgar score is a scoring system doctors and nurses use to assess newborns at one minute and five minutes after they're born. The Apgar score is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score  the better the baby is doing after birth. I got a glimpse of my precious baby and she was quickly taken for medical attention and I was sent to Post OP room. When I was sent into the post delivery room  there I was united with my husband and our newborn. I was in heaven. Seeing her was love at first sight. Having a child is such an unexplainable feeling. Saying it’s the best feeling in the world is an understatement  it is so much more than that. I’m so grateful and blessed the Lord blessed me with a child. We had visitors come meet our baby that morning. When it came time to feeding Amelia  she had trouble latching. As the day went on  something did not seem right. Amelia would sleep  not want to feed  and then we noticed she was turning her head severely to the right and jerking her arms and legs. It was so subtle. We voiced our concerns to her pediatrician (at the time) and we were assured that it was normal. As the day went on  we had more visitors come by. While we had one visitor in  Amelia started the head turning and jerking movements again. We notified the nurse and eventually the NP on call came in to assess Amelia. She did not say what was going on with Amelia. All she said was she’ll have to be sent to a different hospital via helicopter. Amelia was taken to the nursery  and there she was connected to a pulse oximeter. Amelia’s oxygen saturation’s were dropping. She was placed on oxygen and was having seizures more frequently. It was late at night and I could not bear the thought of my daughter being in a whole different city without me at her side. I begged the midwife to release me early. After some time Raul and I left the hospital. I left the hospital with no pain medication. I was hurting so much but all I could think about was Amelia. The NICU called my cellphone wanting verbal consents for a lumbar puncture. Raul and I were still on our way to the hospital. Amelia had a week stay in the NICU. During that week  many tests and lab work were performed to find out what was going on. Amelia suffered a right MCA infarct and was experiencing seizures as a symptom from the stroke. She was started on two anti seizure medications. What seemed like a long week  it had come time to take our sweet baby girl home. We continued the medication at home and tapered her off by four months of age. Amelia has not experienced any seizures since her NICU stay. We followed up with her pediatrician (at the time) and voiced another concern we had. Amelia’s chest would feel wet  cough  had watery eyes while feeding. Which are signs of aspiration. Again  this doctor blew it off. Good thing we had a follow up with a different doctor is San Antonio. We told her and got a order for a swallow study. Turned out Amelia was silently aspirating. We started thickened fluids (makes it easier to swallow). Amelia started OT at two weeks old  ST with feeding and swallowing around April and PT followed. Despite Amelia’s disability and diagnosis (stroke  dysphagia  cerebral palsy  developmental delays) she amazes me every day with her resilience and perseverance. She is my HERO. Slowly but SURELY Amelia is compensating and In my hopes will fully recover. I expect nothing less from her. Other than her left sided weakness  most people don’t realize she has a disability. Amelia is so smart and understands so much. She is NOT defined by her diagnosis. Amelia’s neurologist informed me about neuroplasticity. It’s where the brain can make different connections or rewire to compensate for the side that’s affected. THAT’S what I’m holding on to. No matter how many times I just want to curl up  cry my eyes out and just ask why  I will remain strong and be Amelia’s advocate  her backbone. I pray that Amelia doesn’t have to struggle for things that come easy to others. Til this day doctors can NOT tell me what caused her stroke! It was NOT anything genetic  disease  clotting disorders  infections  etc. Other than the obvious complications during delivery. All donations will be used for Amelias' doctor's visits  therapy services  swallow studies  thickener  etc. Anything is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.,2068,5000,14,41,30,152,5

Music Therapy for Senior Care,https://www.gofundme.com/singingtogether,7,BONITASPRINGS,FL,Music Therapy for Seniors and Dementia CareI have worked in residential treatment with Children for five years and I have been a full time caregiver for Seniors for seven years.I have worked as a Certified Nurses Assistant  full-time caregiver  and in end-of-life care. I have won two SHARP awards for outstanding caregiving in Orange County  North Carolina.My work has involved me singing and playing guitar for residents in  facilities and group homes as well as organizing activities and wellness programs. It is my passion to provide excellent care as well as music therapy to seniors  especially for those suffering from dementia and debilitating conditions.As a direct caregiver  I have been given the insight and ability to connect with residents and encourage group participation.  The larger purpose behind the music is to inspire togetherness and memories that directly connect people to the popular songs that were part of their lives for decades and still hold relevance today.Studies have shown that singing together in groups has been effective in relieving feelings of loneliness and isolation.Over the years of working in clinical and group settings I have witnessed first hand how music and the conversations surrounding music stimulate memory and feelings that awaken minds that suffer from Dementia.The feeling of well-being and belonging is enforced by the connection between music and memory.  My goal is to raise $3 000 dollars to go into 100 nursing homes  rehab facilites  and hospice centers  and provide music entertainment and a theraputic outlet for residents and patients who need encouragement and enthusiastic support during this season of their life.I have been singing in nursing homes since I was a child.  The last 7 years I have performed and connected with dozens of seniors and caregivers as a volunteer.  These funds would help support the time and travel needed to reach a community that is largely ignored and isolated by modern society.  With your supportive donation  I will provide a newsletter as well as pictures and videos of the lives touched by sharing songs together.  My future goal is to involve at-risk youth in music therapy for seniors by providing training on guitar  piano  drums  and singing in exchange for time spent playing in nursing care homes.  I hope you will join me on this mission to cure global loneliness for seniors and help to combat Alzheimer's disease through music healing.Thank you John FerrisSinging Together Music Therapy Organization johnandferris.wordpress.com musicandmemory.org alz.org,1570,3000,10,52,17,134,8

They explained to us that because this is so aggressive  they have to treat it very aggressively. We will be traveling to Little Rock  Arkansas very often for Chemo treatments and other appointments.During this long journey  I am dedicating my life to my mom. We will need a lot of help along the way including medical  travel  and rooming expenses  not to mention a lot of prayers and support.,428,5000,3,9,8,287,5
Team Austin-Fight For LIFE,https://www.gofundme.com/teamaustinsanchez,1,CORPUSCHRISTI,TX,On March 25  2016  Austin Sanchez who is 9 years old now was diagnosed with Wilms Tumor at the age of 7 years old. Wilms tumor is a type of cancer that starts in the kidneys. It is the most common type of kidney cancer in children. After two years of fighting this cancer  it has now metastasized to his lung. Despite previous therapies  more intensive medical treatment is now needed.Austin has been treated at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi  TX for the past two years  doctors have now said there is no further treatment for Austin and have referred him to Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. After traveling to Houston and speaking with Doctors about Austin’s cause we have come to find that they have no other options for him  other than an experimental phase 1 trials which have no cure. That would entail for us as parents of Austin  to sign a consent form acknowledging that they may put different types of new drugs in him for a duration that can last up to a year and at the completion nothing will have been accomplished other than breaking Austin's body down and damaging him forever and not being able to seek any treatment at all. As parents of Austin  we know we have a fighter amongst us and it is our duty to find him the best of care he deserves. After doing multiple researches we have found Dr. Jeffery Dome a Wilms Tumor Specialist from National Children’s Hospital in Washington DC. After speaking with a team member led by Dr. Dome we knew we had to make the visit up to Washington DC. Our meeting went great  he said that there were in fact options for Austin to continue his fight and beat his cancer once and for all.The reason for this Go Fund Me is to help relieve the financial burden of medical  travel  and living expenses. At this point it may be likely that the insurance may delay his coverage for their reasons. In order to start his treatment without any delays we are needing to raise about $40 000 to get started on the treatments. Once treatment has started additional funds will be needed for future medical needs such as hospitals stays  illness that may occur during treatments and further treatment. I as a father of a 9-year-old child with cancer and as a family ask if you can continue to help make Austin’s journey possible. We will continue to fight for Austin's life  but with support of family  friends  and our community like you we can face anything and everything that comes our way knowing that funds will not be an issue. I would like to sincerely say thank you to everyone who has already contributed and thank you to those who will contribute in the future and help make this journey possible. Team Austin.

rayandsuz@yahoo.com,https://www.gofundme.com/3iqezmo,1,SAINTLOUIS,MO,Hi! My name is Suzanne and I have cancer. Again. In 2003  I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast and lymph node cancer. I went through chemo  radiation and radical mastectomy. Somehow I defied the odds and .survived. Unfortunately the heavy doses of chemo put me in menopause and my doctor said that I would never have children. Fast forward to 2007. I met my soulmate and the love of my life  Ray. Together we proved the doctors wrong and had a beautiful daughter  Tyler. I finally had my family and my purpose. In 2015 the cancer came back. Small cell lung cancer. Again I did chemo and radiation. Again I somehow beat it. For a year. In 2017 I got the bad news. The cancer came back. As always  I hoped for the best and prepared my family for what might happen. Unless you have been through this  you simply cannot imagine how crushing it is to tell the love of your life and your baby girl that you are sick again. It's devastating. Because of the immense amounts of previous treatment  immunotherapy was the next option. Well  it sounds great on TV but it almost killed me. Not even a year later I found myself back at my doctor. The small cell lung cancer was back with a vengeance and this time it brought a friend. Bone cancer. I asked my doctor for a miracle. He said that staying alive this long IS a miracle. He said that he could get me a year. So again I fight. The only treatment that I could do was proton radiation. I am hopeful that will at least slow this cancer down. I have never asked anyone for anything but now I'm asking/begging for help. Imagine the astronomical medical bills. Imagine leaving the people who love you the most to not only have to suffer through your chronic illness but to deal with the aftermath of the expenses. My dying wish is to make sure that they are going to be alright. My husband Ray and I have a small family owned and operated dog grooming business in St Louis. Our 10 year old daughter is the center of our world. I just can't imagine a minute without the three of us together but the reality is that my time is limited. Please help me to make sure that they will be okay without me.My family appreciates your love and support.,1005,3000,7,34,8,103,7
Assaulted &amp; Unable to provide for my family .,https://www.gofundme.com/47zbq6-save-our-family-home,0,LONGMONT,CO,Hello for those who dont know me my name is Paige I am a mother of three   a wife & I work full time between two jobs  not including the job of being a mom  and a wife  and  starting my craft business  on the side . I'm reaching out to friends and family and community  because at this point we are in need of help . Thursday November 29th I was assaulted at work confronting an minor for consuming alcohol  she attacked me while I was cleaning  tables she shoved me and began punching me the handful of pint glasses and pitchers I was holding crashed to the ground and shattered   she continued to hold on to my hair repeatedly punching me in the head neck & back I fell to the ground where she continued to kick me while I was being pulled backward by a coworker trying to get her off of me. The injuries I sustained during the attack have left me with a fractured spine unable to perform daily duties. I have lost not one but two jobs I am unable to continue providing childcare during the day.  I am unsure of the recovery process or how long it will be until I am back at work  able to make an income for my family .  I am fortunate the workmans comp will be covering my medical expenses but as far as Financial compensation I have been left with a tenth of the income that I was once contributing to our household. Since the accident I have not been able to cover any of my financial responsibilities. I solely relied on tips as a major part of the income I received   my day job of providing childcare & my craft sales . After the assault my husband took a few days off to help me as I was left pretty much bedridden in pain adjusting to painkillers and muscle relaxer regimen unable to even take care of myself . Upon returning to work my husband found out he was now without a job that due to the on going medical needs and appointments I have they felt he would be taking more days off and they need a carpenter full-time. So now not only am I without an income my husband is as well and while he is diligently searching for a new job . UPDATE : thankfully  my husband  has  a new job ! unfortunately  he was out of work for a week  and the pay periods  are every two weeks at his new job  putting us in a position Where We Are steadily falling behind. My mom has also taken family medical leave from work  unpaid  to help us with all the mundane tasks of day today duties she is driving my kids to and from school because I'm unable to drive she is helping me around the house with laundry and dishes and helping keep clean because I am unable   she has taken on all of my responsibilities cooking and cleaning and providing for my family . Thursday night has left me not only  physically broken but financially and emotionally as well . For the first week I was left in a helpless state feeling like this girl has taken everything from me and is not going to be punished at all because we didn't even have a name for her we had no information how to tracker no leads and everybody who knew her was not willing to give any information in finding her.  Thursday the 6th I got the call after an exhaustive week of my managers diligently probing players for information the police were able to track her down and arrest her she is now facing second degree assault charges and child abuse charges . as bitter as it may seem I don't have the satisfaction of her sitting in jail because she was released on personal reconnaissance all the while I'm still and my own personal jail  broken  unable to be the wife and mother and worker I was before. It is the month of December a Time spent in the gracious notion of the Goodwill. We are not focusing on gifts this year but more so the gift that medically things weren't worse I'm very lucky that where my neck broke I don't face the severity that comes along with spinal injuries. But what we are so overwhelmed with is what we are facing after December   with me not being able to contribute  to are financial obligations  we will not have  are rent amount (1560.00) and could face eviction   & the possibility of losing my husband's work truck   that he solely relies on as he is a carpenter.  We moved here from out of state in May and sold everything we owned to move here so we have nothing to sell to help at this time . I have passionately been pursuing my creative side and have been crafting alot over the past few months   unfortunately since the accident I have not been capable but do have multiple items for sale if you would like to send support and purchase a homemade craft. Check out my Instagram portfolio dreamingtree303 . I know that during this time everyone is in their own Financial dilemma with the task of giving gifts and providing Christmas for their families. We're  asking out of Mercy  out of pity out of General Goodwill if you are able to at all help us during this time it would mean so much to us.  If you are unable to donate please  pass  this on . What this 20 year old girl has done to my family and to my world is Unforgivable   by her carelessness and lack of morals she really has caused so much more devastation .,1550,3000,17,52,14,54,4

Help Alfie Fight Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/gofundmecomlets-save-Alfie,0,EDMONDS,WA,"Hello Friends  Doodle Lovers and Family-  I would like to introduce to you \Alfie\""  a 4-year-old adorable goldendoodle that my friend Bernadette rescued about three years ago from a horrible situation.  The good news is that she gave him a loving home  complete with a companion doodle  \""Copper.\""  He has become a wonderful dog  and a very very loved member of their family. Well  sadly  we have had a serious turn in the road. So far  in the past three weeks  Alfie has not been well.  His appetite has diminished  losing massive amounts of weight.  He is coughing up mucus  and is having a horrible time breathing.  After many trips to the vet he's had several tests: x-ray  needle aspiration  biopsy  CT scan and blood and urine tests to try to get a conclusive diagnosis. It's been an emotional rollercoaster  to say the least  and totally draining. He's still coughing and barely eating. Each inconclusive test means more waiting for the results of the next test. Last Tuesday he was scheduled for surgery to remove the lobe of his lung because the biopsy results said it was an abscess. Once the pre-surgical CT was done  they found inflamed lymph nodes and nodules on the liver  so he was no longer a good candidate for surgery. Aspiration of the lung and liver showed no cancer cells  so he was tested for a fungal infection. We now know that it's not a fungal infection and is most likely a very aggressive cancer of the immune system called Histiocystic Sarcoma. Surgery would weaken him and not be able to remove all of the nodules. He was sent home with Prednisone to increase his appetite and possibly help with the coughing  and he is doing a little better.  We go back for a recheck in a week. With this type of cancer there is no medical treatment like chemotherapy or radiation that will work.  What this cancer does is attack the immune system  and thus  it is now attacking his lung  and will likely continue to spread throughout his body.  If this continues it's likely that he has only a short time left  maybe weeks left.  If we continue to do nothing  he will die.   Yet  I do believe that Alfie deserves all the HOPE we can muster.   Therefore Alfie needs to go through an alternative treatment that his pet insurance will not cover and it is expensive.  I ask you to go deep into your heart and ask yourself if this were your baby like Alfie is to Bernadette  wouldn't you do whatever it took to make him well?   Will you donate to Alfie's cause to help him get the help he needs?""",1235,2000,17,62,45,180,5

Ray Fahey&apos;s Accident Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/friends-of-raymond-fahey-fund,7,Ottawa,ON,Raymond could use your assistance!!! Raymond S. Fahey has been a lifelong Ottawa resident and an inspiration to his 3 wonderful daughters  extensive network of friends and business associates. Many people unknowingly would have attended one or some of the many consumer shows he has put on here for the past four decades. His passion for putting on the Ottawa Spring and Fall Home Shows and The Ottawa Cottage Show to name a few was his way to help support local businesses. In 2014 his struggle with diabetes took a turn for the worst. The unfortunate result was having to amputate his right foot mid calf. Regardless of this setback he's managed to maintain an upbeat attitude  exercise  eat super healthy  meditate and get out and about as much as he does is truly remarkable! Many thanks to all of you who still keep Ray on their minds. Your calls  visits and messages of support makes a huge difference in the quality of his life and your love and care is greatly appreciated.  Last night after a pleasant meal and laughter filled stories with old friends Ray had a very unfortunate wheelchair incident. He accidently wheeled off an unseen curb causing him to crash to the asphalt fracturing the femur on his right stump leg  right patella (kneecap) as well as his left wrist (no wheelchairing). This is going to take a minimum of 3 to 4 months for a full recovery.  The doctors and specialists assessed his medical status and capabilities it's determined Raymond will need extensive home care. There are going to be considerable challenges to live day to day until he recovers. 24/7 care would make his life much easier. Imagine being in his situation and not having the help you need to function daily.  It’s our turn for everyone to step up  give back  and make sure this amazing man gets the care he needs. Any support you can offer would be appreciated. All of us seek a little peace of mind if found in the same situation. Any contribution of $$$'s deposited to Raymond's' bank account will go a long way to ensure he gets the care this wonderful family  friends and local business supporter deserves. Thank you. And Raymond thanks you for your generosity.,6350,5000,38,127,40,25,5

Wellness for Aslan,https://www.gofundme.com/resurrect-aslan,0,FAIRFAX,CA,The first day in November of 2018 I got what I thought was a simple cat scratch. A week later on my birthday I was taken to the ER with a high fever due to infection and was very sick. I was diagnosed with a severe infection. My entire body was affected. I had a minor surgery to remove and clean infected tissue from my forearm and was put on massive amounts of antibiotics then they sent me on my way. Two days later I woke up in the middle of the night with a severe head pain and I felt like I was either going to have a seizure or my head was going to explode (or both) and had to call an ambulance. They kept me in hospital for the next day and then released me after my fever broke. The antibiotics just hadn't kicked in yet I guess? By this time  my body felt like it was attacking me. I was in pain all the time  I couldn't sleep I just felt like I was falling apart. Unfortunately my job offered no short or long term disability  and I couldn't return to work due to an open wound arm and the risk of re-infection was sever. This puts me in a situation where I was unable to work to make my rent payments or cover any of my bills. I was sidelined and have been unable to work. It has been difficult getting by with no income. Having to be at the hospital every couple of days has also been draining. I've been staying with friends and sleeping in my car near the hospital.. I eat one meal a day and hope the phone will ring with some good news. Not being able to work and having to ask for the help of others is an difficult for me. I tried to get thru this on my own but I need your support badly. I'm worried sick with how I will make it through this unfortunate situation.I feel pathetic having to ask for help like this but I don't know what else to do. All I can do is pray and hope that my friends and family (or anyone who cares for that matter) could find it in their hearts to donate whatever they can to help me cover the expenses. If my current employer offered short and/or long term disability insurance (like my last employer did) then I would have certainly opted for it  but they do not so I'm literally begging for you to help with whatever you can  the smallest donation is still a big help. The timing of this is so unfortunate.My most pressing concern right now is avoiding homelessness. I need help  as much as it hurts to say. I'm not hoping for a miracle but if I can get enough to cover the necessities it would make my world. These donations will go to the following; Rent  Car Payment and insurance  Hospital Parking  Gas and rides/taxi's and ambulance rides etc..I am not requesting close to how much I owe which was not covered but just enough to help me get back on my feet  insurance helped some  but did not pay for all of it  and does not pay for loss of work and regular bills such as rent and others I need to pay to survive like groceries. I hate having to ask for help  but sometimes we need to reach out and see what comes back in return. I don't want to lose my home and I need help. Any amount will do. Thank you all in advance for all of your support and amazing words of encouragement. I am so lucky for my friends who have been such an amazing support. I sincerely thank anybody that could help contribute to help me in this difficult time. Please share this story if you could. The more exposure this gets hopefully I will get the help I so desperately need. Thank you so much for whatever help you can give  even if it's just sharing my story. Your prayers are also very much appreciated. God Bless -Aslan,1535,15000,16,10,11,45,4
Help our friend Joey Falzone,https://www.gofundme.com/sk6n6-help-beth-woolsey-with-income-loss,0,LEESSUMMIT,MO,What started out as a perfect winter deer hunt one November afternoon (November 25th) with his bow  arrows and everything he could possibly need- sure ended in one horrific day with a broken ankle so bad that he wasn't able to even walk on it. When he got down from the tree stand  it had snowed a lot and somehow stepped in a hole or uneven ground or something (still not sure) but he fell to the ground  tried to walk and couldn't at all! He had to crawl up a huge hill leaving his equipment and even his phone (which had died  of course) behind knowing he was in trouble if he didn't somehow find help and the only place out there occupied by anyone was a nice man named Scott who then called Joey's son  told him his Dad was hurt bad and where to pick him up. His girlfriend took him to the Emergency room and as it turns out  he had not only broken his ankle  it was so much worse! He actually had what they called Syndesmosis  which is the disruption of the distal attachment of the Tib/Fib w/fracture and would need surgery to repair it with a plate and screws... This was much more of a serious surgery than we ever expected. After surgery  which was this past Thursday  He would be down  leg up no walking at least *another 8 weeks* and still not allowed to put ANY weight on his foot whatsoever. After that 8 weeks  depending on how he heals  he will have Physical therapy for several months and eventually back to walking again. Joe(y) is a self-employed independent contractor  (you've probably seen some of his jobs when he posts before and afters) He just purchased a new truck for his business as the other one had just worn out. (Timing  right?) There's just so many things most of us just aren't prepared for if something like this happens. Through the year he tries to save up for the winter with Hope for short winters and that his funds last all winter but this one will be different for sure since this accident has put him completely out of commission. He still had projects on the books to do but just isn't able to do them. Joey is facing at least 3 to 4 months without any income coming but the expenses continue  and somehow by the grace or God  Friends & Family- somehow need to be met. We are very worried about him. Please help us  help Joey in his sitiation from this series of unfortunate events. Contribute what you can for friend truly in need  one that will be pretty upset with us when he finds out we are even doing this for him. If you know him  you know Joey is *that guy* that would give the shirt off of his own back to anyone in need and not think twice about it. To make things worse  he hasn't ever even broken a bone in his life so this is all so foreign to him. Thank you so much for your prayers and anything you can do to help... no matter what that is.,530,6000,7,9,9,107,4
Veronica  Coleman,https://www.gofundme.com/Veronica-Coleman,7,HOLLY,MI,In the spring of 2014  my wife Veronica suffered a hemorrhagic stroke. She was totally paralyzed on her left side. The doctors said that there was no cure for  a stroke like that  and that she would  recover some motion but not all. She is tired a lot  walks with a limp  does not use her left hand much  and does not speak as easily as she once did. Now  four years later  I notice her having trouble lifting her leg to go up or down the stairs. I have looked for alternative medical treatments that are said to have very good to excellent results and have found two! They are expensive and  on a teachers salary  I can't afford it. Veronica is only 52 years old and is my one and only  true love! We have many wonderful years left to enjoy  and I will do everything a husband can do   to make those years the best!,5400,25000,21,22,87,242,9
Katie My Love!,https://www.gofundme.com/katie-my-love,1,HORSHAM,PA,Our dear friend and sister  Katie Clawson  was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma on November 7  2016. She started cancer treatment that December  but was found refractory (meaning that the cancer kept growing) to that first type of chemotherapy. Since then  she’s had over 50 infusions and radiation treatments and 7 different types of cancer treatment (including chemotherapy  radiation  and immunotherapy). Yet  each time she’s been refractory to the treatment  as her cancer has proven too aggressive for all of them.A few weeks ago  her cancer progressed on the last type of treatment that is known to be able to help her reach remission. This news has been devastating  but we are not giving up hope! We are now pursuing clinical trials across the United States  starting with a screening for a trial on 11/19 in NYC.While Katie spent her career working hard as a school psychologist  due to debilitating side effects of treatment and the cancer  she’s been on leave from her job since May 2018. It’s not easy for her to ask for help  so we figured we’d do it for her! At this time  we are asking for any support that you would be willing to provide to assist Katie (and her caregiver) with the expense of traveling to and from clinical trials  medical expenses involved in her care  and living expenses.Please take a moment to consider donating to Katie  as no contribution is too small to make an impact.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Sasha  Chrissy  and Sarah,9480,10000,23,95,123,292,5
Alaskan Family Recover From 7.2 Earthquake,https://www.gofundme.com/Alaskan-Family-After-72-Earthquake,2,BIGLAKE,AK,After the 7.2 magnitude earthquake and several large aftershocks rattled southcentral Alaska on Friday  November 30  Hillary and her four young children have been displaced from their home  which is a couple miles away from this aerial picture. Their home  originally built for them by her father  is not only destroyed inside but the foundation is cracked and unsafe. Though it is still early to assess what the final costs will be  the home along with many of its contents appear to be a total loss. The house is without power  heat and water.We are raising money that will help to alleviate some of the financial burden that comes along with this devastating  unforeseen event  including but not limited to: repairs to the home if possible  replacing items that were lost  temporary housing costs during repairs or while looking for a more permanent housing situation. Any financial amount would be a huge blessing to Hillary and Travis  but if you cannot afford to donate  please consider saying a prayer for them or reach out if you have other ways you could help (building materials  etc).Hillary & Travis will be using the funds to rebuild the foundation or they will be using it to get a new place until the spring of 2019. As of now the construction has to wait until spring to fully repair.,3610,7000,31,52,24,30,5

The Return of Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/JackieExtrandBye,1,NISSWA,MN,Three difficult words to hear: You have cancer. I was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Unfortunately  my doctor shared these three words again with me almost two years to the day later. Just a little background on myself and how I am back in this situation....many years ago I was in the Peace Corps in Uganda for 4 years. During that time  I had every dysentery known  such as  amoebas  parasites  giardia. When I returned home from Uganda  my energy levels and immune system were never quite the same.When I was diagnosed with cancer over two years ago  the source of my cancer was from a build-up of H. Pylori from my gut (from my Peace Corps years with the unresolved dysentery) and from my mouth with root canals and infected cavitation. This created the perfect storm for the breast cancer. Along with the breast cancer  my doctor diagnosed me with “neutropenia” - an abnormally low concentration of neutrophils (type of white blood cell) in the blood. They make up the majority of circulating white blood cells and serve as the primary defense against infections...and cancer. Due to neutropenia and my compromised immune system  I did not qualify for chemotherapy. My doctor knew from my labs the chemo would kill me. Fortunately  there are many other treatments for cancer I did qualify for. I was blessed to locate one of the best doctors in the world who uses immunotherapy to treat cancer. After working for the Mayo (who has used immunotherapy for many years)  my doctor opened his own clinic in Mankato. Immunotherapy works with your immune system and builds it up so your body can heal from cancer. I went on to have surgery and immunotherapy treatments. Later  my Petscan showed I was in remission.Since I have been in remission...life has provided a series of unfortunate events:-Our house was struck by lightening which led to a house fire.- My job was changed from 9th grade school counselor to 9th-12th grade with an increased case-load- I had Lyme's 3x.- Long Term Disability dropped me out-of-the-blue (they called my doctor 3x and he was not able to return their calls. Their protocol is to drop the patient after not hearing back from the doctor after trying 3x). Financially  this left us strapped.- I was diagnosed with PTSD.- Our water pipes burst which ruined our main floor and basement.- A tree fell on our garage.- My car was totaled from a deer.As a result with the crazy past year  compromised immune system and neutropenia  I have cancer again. My treatment plan is to have surgery and immunotherapy treatments. In addition  I will have a personalized vaccine created from my tumor. My tumor will be sent to South Carolina where the vaccine will be created. I will be traveling one time per month for my vaccine for 6 months. There is great hope in this vaccine as my doctor said it is curing cancer patients. Unfortunately  insurance will not cover my vaccine or travel expenses. How can you help? I ask that you send love  prayers  and healing thoughts. Please do not be fearful for me as I am in great hands with God  my amazing medical team  loving family and friends. I know the universe has my back and God has a great plan for my family and me somewhere in all of this. If you feel compelled to do more  please feel free to contribute to my Go Fund Me site.It is very humbling to receive so this is an easier way for me to receive. Also  there is NO pressure for you to give. Your prayers  love and healing thoughts mean so much to my family and me. Love and blessings Jackie Extrand,1840,5000,25,37,14,27,8
One Last Round Of IVF,https://www.gofundme.com/teamparrisivf,0,OKLAHOMACITY,OK,Where to start! We have been together 8 years and we have been trying to have a baby for 6-7 years now. We have gone through 7 failed IUIs over those years  with no medical coverage and all paid out of pocket. This year we did our first round of IVF  also with no medical coverage  paying around $21 000 out of pocket. We prepared for IVF with a specific medicine and vitamin regimen  and I lost 30 pounds to be able to move forward. We were able to afford it by rigorous saving  working extra side jobs (thank you Postmates)  a fundraiser  a few loans and the love and support of our family and friends. It was such a blessing to be able to do that and not go broke. The honest truth is  IVF was one of the most challenging rollercoasters of life we have yet to be on together. Not only is it physically painful but it is more mentally taxing than I ever imagined. Not to mention  I was unexpectedly unemployed right before we started (which truly ended up being a blessing in disguise). We were able to retrieve 5 mature eggs. 4 fertilized. 3 made it to day 5  and we transferred one before freezing the other two. That transfer ended in a very early miscarriage  which is called a chemical pregnancy. These were the darkest days of my life. I’ve never experienced that kind of grief before. I didn’t think there would be light at the end of the tunnel. We eventually recovered as much as one can  and regained hope to try again by transferring our last two embryos in July. Neither of the embryos took this round. Complete devastation again knowing those were the last ones we had. The emotional heartbreak was also coupled with pain so bad I had to go back to the doctor to make sure there wasn’t a serious issue and ended up in pain killers and bed rest. It was horrible.So obviously  I wasn’t sure I wanted to do this again. I’m sure all of you reading understand this thinking. Why would I go through all of it again. The pain. The bruising. The nausea. The bloating. The restricted lifestyle. The getting your hopes up to maybe have them let down. The potential failure and utter heart break it could bring. I was ready to just give up on my dream of being a mom for awhile if not forever. This is a dream I’ve had my whole life  and I was ready to walk away.And then something switched one day. I want to give it one last shot (or round of shots). I need to do one more round. I have to give it my ALL  even more than last time before I give up my dream. I talked to my doctor (WHO WE LOVE) and she believes we are still great candidates for a successful round of IVF. She believes that we know how my body responds now and could tailor a plan better for me with meds if we wanted to do another round. And she let me know there is a chance I could be a part of a study in January/February 2019 with our clinic that would help pay for $1800 of meds  AND could potentially put us in a randomized group that gets genetic testing for free. During our last round we did not do PGS testing (the genetic testing) due to it being an additional $5000-10 000. However  by doing the testing we would learn which of our embryos are genetically sound  and which are abnormal chromosomally. If an embryo is abnormal  it is likely to not implant at all OR it is likely to end in miscarriage. So by doing the trial  it would give us a 33% chance at getting this extra knowledge at no extra cost. And if we didn’t end up in the testing leg of the trial  we still have saved some money in medicine.That brings me to this page. Since we have spent so much this year already  we are unsure that we can make the goal to be able to pay for it by January. We are trying so hard  and are saving again. I will be starting my Postmates deliveries again. Jer has a few side projects as well. However  if we get to the trial and cannot pay we would have to pass the opportunity up. We are not sitting back idly hoping for a change. We are preparing. We started the keto diet which has proven to help fertility  and weight loss in general will help IVF. I have educated myself about the impact of BPA  phthalates and toxins on fertility and am making changes to our lifestyle to avoid these things. I’m taking more supplements and taking better care of what I am putting in my body. We are paying off loans from earlier and trying to put back money at the same time. It’s a challenge at all directions but we are facing them with hope.While I absolutely HATE asking for more help  as so many have helped already  I feel like this may be the only way we will make the deadline. We do not expect any donations. I have no expectation here. I just know that right now we are giving this all we’ve got to try to make it happen and that there are people that love us and want to help us succeed. So  if you can give  I literally don’t have enough words of gratitude. If you can’t  I still cannot thank you enough for your support and prayers. And if everyone could try to share our story  that would mean the world. Infertility is one of the biggest unspoken things in the world we live in today and I personally just like my story being shared to try and break that stigma.,9665,15000,9,64,18,178,7
Connor&apos;s Top Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/connors-top-surgery,6,CLARKSTON,MI,Hi! My name is Connor and I am a 19 year old college student in Michigan. I am also female-to-male transgender  and I am raising money for top surgery.I plan to have surgery in April/May of 2019. This surgery is necessary for improving my quality of life. I currently use a binder to make my chest appear smaller  and have been binding for over five years. Binding is unsafe and can cause many back/spine problems  so having this surgery will not only alleviate some of my dysphoria  but future back problems as well. I have been openly trans for five years  and have been taking weekly shots of testosterone for over a year to further my transition.Though I have saved up about half the money I need for top surgery  I have decided to use this platform as a means to support the rest of my funds for top surgery so that I can afford to pay for housing  tuition  and other University-related expenses. Any amount helps  and if you are unable to donate all I ask is that you share this page! Thank you!ABOUT ME: Like I said  I am a 19 year old college student in my second year at university and I am studying music education. I play several instruments  and my hobbies include basketball  hiking  and photography.

Gerardo Velascos Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/Velascos-Medical-Fund,8,VACAVILLE,CA,First responders have long been known to have an increased risk for suicide secondary to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with a recent Poll by Harris and the University of Phoenix revealing 33% of all first responders being officially diagnosed.  In April 2018  the Ruderman Family Foundation released an article stating that in 2017 more first responders died from suicide than in the line of duty.  Per the article posted in the New York Daily News  PTSD and depression stemming from exposure to trauma were the top two factors contributing to the higher than usual suicide rates. One of our own   Gerardo Velasco   who has been an EMT with Medic Ambulance for 4 years and has always taken great pride in serving the communities of Solano County and its residents has recently been severely affected by the rigors associated with PTSD. Gerardo was on duty one day and dispatched to the scene of a traumatic vehicle accident involving a well-known police officer in the EMS family along with another man killed in the collision.  Attempting to be a strong man and brave father  he kept the troubled thoughts racing in his mind to himself and didn’t reach out to anyone about the personal anguish he was feeling inside.  The passion for EMS sometimes comes with a price and on August 23  2018 he reached his breaking point by self-inflicting a severe life-threatening injury to himself. The aftermath led to a trauma activation for emergency care  several hours of cardiothoracic surgery  and hospitalization in the ICU where he continues to recover now. Thankfully the damage was repaired and he is expected to make a full recovery from his injuries.  The long road of healing  recovery   and rehabilitation is now looming ahead of him and it is the hope of this EMS family to help him get back on his feet so he may return to the job he loves so much in serving the people of Solano County.  The mounting bills and escalating medical expenses should not interfere with his ability to rise above this personal tragedy.  Gerardo is a loving father of a son   Angelo who is 2 years old and a beautiful daughter   Adellai who just turned 6 months old. As of now   Gerardo is still in the hospital and I will update this site as his path to recovery continues. It is now our turn to help him just like he has helped so many of us in our time of need.  Please join me   our EMS family   friends   and loved ones in raising funds of any amount to assist in Gerardo’s recovery and healing process. Thank you in advance for all your help.,1700,9000,15,19,32,151,8
"Depression, an all time low, Cant find a job",https://www.gofundme.com/3q9yue0,0,29120,US,"Well  this is embarrassing.  Anyone that knows me well  knows how stubborn I am to ask for help  but here I am  taking my pride and stomping on it  my heart and soul layed out here in a very long story. A lot of my friends and family have said that if there's anything that they can do to help  that they will. So here I am.... I need financial help to have gas  pay for doctor visits  medications  utilities  and my auto insurance payment is due very soon. I have no health insurance so I pay for everything out of pocket.    I recently lost my job at the tattoo studio I worked at. I must say though: I do not have any ill feelings or regrets for working at any of the studios I've worked at.     Eventually  missed days  hospitalizations  and performance issues due to my illnesses caused a strain: on myself and the business. I'd feel guilty and would either eventually be let go  or leave for another studio due to growing tensions  the latter was more the case. Even the most patient and sympathetic bosses have a limit.    I think it's time that I take a break from tattooing  to focus on myself and my new found relationship with God. I am by no means quitting forever. I'm not asking to be supported and lay around. Im going to try another line of work for a bit  even if it's being a cashier at a Dollar store.     My parents and my ex husband have been very helpful in this time  but I do not want to be a huge burden to them.    For many reasons I'd like to tell you my story of how I ended up here. I apologize in advance for how lengthy this has been so far  and however lengthy it ends up being. I focus mostly on the Depression aspect of all of my diagnoses because it's the hardest for me.     My Major Depressive Disorder  Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Social Anxiety Disorder  Panic Disorder  and Dissociative disorder has made life very difficult for the past few years.     I was originally diagnosed in 2011. I took the steps on my own accord to try and treat my illness  which was having a major impact on my life  and sought out a Psychiatrist at Carolina Care Center in West Columbia. I was prescribed 2 medications and sent on my way. I was very optimistic about finally having the courage to get help. My conditions were labeled as genetic and chronic.    Fast forward a few years. I honestly can't remember how many short visits I've had  sitting in a room at the hospital being watched by a guard  to make sure I didn't harm myself. I really don't think I had any intentions of doing so  but the thoughts were there. You hear about people committing suicide from Depression and I suppose some would think that they must have been in a lot of pain to do such a thing. There are other opinions on it  but until you've been through it  you really don't understand how painful it really can get. A lot of you know me as a strong and brave person  and I still am. I'll never resort to ending my life. I can't take the thought of how many lives I'd ruin to save myself from my own pain.    Depression isn't being sad  or simply having a bad day. Honestly  I wish they would had called it something else. Anything else. The pain is as real as it gets. The stigma is hurtful. The \pull up your big girl panties\"" or \""man up\"" comments are devastating  because if I could   I absolutely would. It feels like someone you loved just died. It feels like you can't move. I feel worthless. I feel like a failure for things I haven't even failed at  yet. My mind tells me these things. I try to fight it  hard  but  it's constantly there.     Sometimes  my Depression lessens enough where I can put on auto pilot and fake my way through a day. That's the best it ever gets though. At least I can function. But  most days  even the simplest of things like taking a shower is like climbing Mt Everest. Dinner may be a cold can of chicken noodle soup  because I don't have the energy or motivation to put it in the microwave. I can sleep for over 24 hours straight sometimes  dead to the world  not even hearing the loudest of alarm clocks  especially if I'm over stressed. The 7 medications I take  that all cause drowsiness  don't help that either. Without them however  I would surely be put in a Psychiatric ward.     Anyone that thinks that those places are therapeutic  needs to know the truth. You're treated like cattle  hearded up in a line to take medications that can change without your notice  without your consent  and if you refuse  they will find a way to administer them  even if by force. The staff is not focused on care. They are focused on order and compliance. You are punished if you don't make your bed  even if you can't see straight or feel like your legs are going to collapse from under you from the cocktail of medications they pump you up with. You can only use the phones in a very short window of time per day  limited to 15 minutes. You may see your assigned Doctor twice when you're there  if you're lucky. There are group therapy sessions  but your crammed in a room with 20 people of all different kinds of problems. Some are so out of it that they can only randomly shout out unintelligible things. Some are aggressive. This is the best they have for people suffering.     I only mention this because people think that if I don't admit myself to be hospitalized that I'm not trying to help myself.Then there's Depression's cousin  Anxiety and her sister Panic. If the Depression dosen't make you feel bad enough  they will make sure to fill in any pain gaps. I may be able to chalk up the energy to go grocery shopping  only to sit in the car for 30 minutes prepping myself to walk inside. The fear is paralyzing and completely illogical. I know it is  but that doesn't stop my heart from pounding  my hands from shaking  shortness of breath  tightness in my chest and a general feeling of being completely out of control. I also feel stupid and worthless for not even being able to just go inside and get groceries like a normal person. Eventually  I do make it inside. This applies to all aspects of my days most days. Im grateful for the days when I can fake that I'm ok.    There's no way that in this short novella that I could go over everything I experience day to day. Just a few highlights.     Please  if you want to help with words  don't offer me advice. Some of it can be very harmful  even if you don't mean for it to. Pray for me  send good vibes  check on me  be compassionate. Those things help.    If you've read this far  thank you for taking the time. I don't know how well I really expressed myself  because I'm all over the place in my head. Love you all.""",345,1000,20,35,15,44,7

By the age of eleven she has not only penned several detective series  mysteries  fictional reinterpretations of historical events  comedies and dramas  but she has also made numerous short movies based on her writings.  Savannah’s considerable aptitude on the computer has fueled her ambitions and she wants to write and produce short films based on her stories. In addition to the talents I’ve already mentioned Savannah is also quite gifted in music she sings and produces her own songs! Instead of trying to raise funds for everything that Savannah truly needs  we’ve decided to focus on the three most important issues that would give Savannah a foundation to grow from. Please consider donating towards a new wheelchair  walker or computer for Savannah. Your generousity will truly change her life. I’ve posted pictures and information about each item and welcome your feedback  ideas and suggestions towards helping us reach our goal.

Mandy Powell&apos;s Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/st4pq-mandys-medical-expenses,9,London,ON,On my December 11  2018 my cousin Mandy collapsed and was rushed to the ER  where she was diagnosed with sepsis. Since December 11  2018 Mandy has had SIX invasive surgeries  went into cardiac arrest during three of the procedures and has had to have her leg amputated due to resulting damage from the sepsis. She is currently still riddled with infection  relying on life support to assist her heart and awaiting further surgeries. Mandy's story began around two years ago when she was unable to continue working for her company due to poor management and an influx in sick days. Not long after Mandy left her company she was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer which contributed to her lethargy and time off from work. Unfortunately  due to the size of the tumor they were unable to operate and recommended chemotherapy in order to reduce the tumor to an operable size. Mandy  battled through cancer and chemotherapy and was finally in a position where the tumor could be operated on  only for the surgeon to perforate her bowel in the process. Due to the surgeons error Mandy was confined to her bed with a colostomy bag; however  the surgeon released her to continue treatment at home. It was at home where Mandy collapsed due to an infection from the colostomy bag which escalated to sepsis and her collapse on December 11. Mandy's condition is still critical and her road to recovery will be long  painful and full of uncertainty. Unfortunately  Mandy does not have any short-term or long-term disability benefits as she is no longer employed. This means that Mandy will have no income while she goes through her lengthy and agonizing  recovery process which could last years. In addition to her traumatic experience  Mandy is a single mother to a little boy named Bailey who suffers from symptoms of ADHD  Autism and Bipolarity. Mandy had to remove her son Bailey from school last year in order to homeschool him as he was a victim of continuous bullying. This GoFundMe is being organized to ease the financial burden on Mandy and her young son. Since December 11  2018 our entire family has been providing Mandy and Bailey with a tremendous amount of love and emotional support. Mandy's mother  who suffers from multiple sclerosis  has been caring for Bailey while his mother has been confined to the ICU. Other member's of our family have continued to offer support by purchasing groceries  clothing  and other essentials for Bailey. However  as Mandy is still critical  our family remains focused entirely on her recovery and comforting her young son Bailey.  As such  my family has not had the opportunity to acknowledge or comprehend the extent of the financial consequences of Mandy's injuries. As you can all appreciate  Mandy has various monthly bills that will now fall to our family to handle  not to mention the costs associated with her recovery  creation of prosthetics  and caring for her young son.  I have organized this GoFundME to assist by helping shoulder some of the financial weight of Mandy's injuries in order to alleviate her financial stress and allow her to solely focus on her recovery and her fight to live. I have never met a woman as strong or admirable as Mandy who continues to fight for her life and for her son. My family and I are profoundly thankful to anyone who can contribute to Mandy and Bailey. No amount is too small.I will keep you updated on her progress.,4080,25000,24,16,25,51,3
Borrowed Parts &amp; Spare Change,https://www.gofundme.com/borrowed-parts-spare-change,0,LOSANGELES,CA,"Hi all. As most of my friends and family know  last year I was given a second chance at life after surviving a liver transplant which was caused by Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. I have and continue to make leaps and bounds in my recovery and have been living this life to the fullest not just for myself  but for the young man who passed and gave me the best gift I've ever received. Back in November of 2016  I went in for a doctor's appointment because I could not seem to shake a cold I had been having. While answering a few questions that turned into a physical  my doctor decided to admit me to our local hospital overnight so that she could run a few more tests. Within twenty-four hours  a team of specialists had told me that without a donor liver  I would not see my thirtieth birthday. My world turned upside down  and within a few short weeks after being diagnosed  my life was forever changed.After being put on immediate medical leave  I was told to move home with my parents due to it not being safe to live on my own any longer. For the next two months  we researched where our best chances would be to receive a new liver across the nation. My family and I spent two months fighting for my life while remembering to enjoy any moments we had left together. Unfortunately  my health was dwindling quicker than expected and time was no longer on my side. By Christmas Day  my body was experiencing liver failure. Three days shy of ringing in the New Year  I had been admitted to Cedars Sinai Medical Center. What transpired over the next thirteen days were the end stages of liver failure and the beginning of renal failure. Now my kidneys were starting to shut down. It was then that I realized it may be time to start telling those close to me how much I loved them and how I had plans of haunting them as soon as I got to where I was going. It was time to say goodbye.On January 11th  2017  my team of brilliant and talented organ transplant doctors and surgeons came into my ICU room and told me that we may have a match. By that evening  I was going into an operating room with a smile on my face  a heart full of hope  and Donna Summer playing per my request as I was being put under. I am happy to report that my new liver  that I have nicknamed \Liv Benson \"" has kept me here on this big ball of blue for over 500 days now. 500 more days of laughter. 500 more days of sunshine. 500 more days of being a typical twenty-something looking for his next adventure. And also  500 more days of receiving countless medical bills  telephone calls  and constant reminders that it costs quite a large amount of money to have a second chance at life. It's taken me a while to swallow my pride and ask for help while trying to tackle all of the bills myself. My family has been a tremendous support system and have helped in more ways than I can count. Ironically enough  my liver team tells me that stress is no good for a transplant patient. I can safely say that my number one cause of stress these days would be the stack of medical bills that continue to pile and remind me of what it has cost to keep me here. I know there are a plethora of other (and albeit more pressing) issues in this world besides one person. But my blessing with this new lease on life has given me the opportunity to continue this journey.  And because of that  I want to be able to share what I have been given (from the smallest experiences to the most significant accomplishments).  I've been blessed enough with this new lease on life  and I don't want to push my luck.  But with the most profound humility  I am putting this energy out into the cosmos so I can continue this journey to the best of my ability  and to ease the burden of money. A Letter To My Donor""",4556,22980,17,20,39,149,6

Help my Dad battle ALS,https://www.gofundme.com/3s0ne6o,7,CHICO,CA,For an update on my Dad’s struggle with ALS  please click on the following post:My Dad’s long battle with ALS continues to progress. The doctors’ current prognosis is one year  possibly two. It’s heartbreaking to see the effects of the disease and what’s happening to him. As with most patients he will lose his ability to walk  speak  swallow and breathe. The amount of care and equipment needed to sustain an ALS patient is mind-boggling. According to the ALS association  the average cost of care for a patient is about $250 000 a year. While insurance covers some  much of it is not. We’re trying hard to provide what he needs and one of our biggest concerns will be his ability to communicate. When his voice is gone the only way he will be able to communicate is through a laptop computer system with eye-gaze technology. However  these systems can be quite costly and insurance will not cover it. Without it he will not be able to tell his loved ones how he feels or that he loves them. He won’t be able to tell his care-providers where he hurts or what he needs. As such  we’re hoping to raise the money to help secure this equipment. While he has other critical needs as well  it’s so important to be able to speak with him during his final days. Please keep in mind that once he passes all his equipment will be donated to the ALS association so that future patients might benefit from their use. So your donations will not only help my father as they will help many more ALS patients in their time of need.For those that missed my previous post allow me to give you a brief history about my Dad. He worked as a firefighter and had a business teaching technical rescue. He taught rescue personnel throughout the United States and out of the country as well. He also worked at a college in Nebraska teaching for an international rescue and relief program. In 2008  he was forced to retire to begin his long battle with ALS. That same year he was presented with a lifetime achievement award for his accomplishments. Furthermore  he had a vision of developing a children’s prevention program about the dangers of moving water  which is a leading cause of accidental death for children under 16 years of age. While fighting his disease he didn’t give up on his vision and completed the “Oscar Otter River Safety and Educational Program”. The program continues to grow and has been introduced in countries all around the world. Thank you in advance for any help  and for your kind thoughts and prayers. And please share this post.,3570,25000,8,14,31,341,13

Throughout her life she has beat all odds and hurdled over every obstacle that stood in her way.

Shawna&apos;s Medical Fundraiser,https://www.gofundme.com/3sh3oeo,0,NORTHLASVEGAS,NV,Hello my name is Shawna Gonzalez. I am the Founder of Project 4 Humanity a very well know non profit that assists every one at any time of the day. I have been the founder for 4 years. During those 4 years we have served out of the back of our car and finally opening our own food pantry that was a major success. We assisted 900 people a week with thier daily essentials. For these past 4 years of running P4H I never took care of myself or saw a doctor unless it was in the ER which we visited a minimum of twice a week. In January of 2018 we decided it was time to start cleaning out our warehouse. During this time I was very Ill often  not knowing what was wrong but feeling like I was in labor. On May 15th it was suggested that I see a cancer doctor for my thyroid. Immediately I start looking for doctors and found Dr. Nasri. The first day i saw him he scheduled emergency surgery for 8/30 to remove a para-thyroid mass. On 8/27 my husband was admitted to the hospital and needed heart surgery. So he got released from the hospital the night before my surgery on 8/30. I was already scared about the surgery but now I had to worry about my husband. I was released from the hospital the next day.  So after all of that I was still getting real sick and having stomach pain so I saw a gastro doc. He did several tests and determined I have a rare disease called GSID. Within a week of that diagnosis I was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia. So my body hurts bad all the time. I cant take pain meds because it will eat my stomach up. My medication for my potential fatal disease is 11k a month and that only 1 of them. I have 3 babies that are trying to be so strong but they hurt when I hurt. Since 8/27/18 we have had to sell things to survive. We are loosing our home with no plan where to go. Christmas wont happen for us this year due to funding. There is only 1 000 people is the world with GSID and there is no cure.I am not used to being the one asking for help but God has guided me to do so. He said people would love to help me like I help others. So please help me by donating so I can stock up on my medicines and have a chance at life a little longer.,1380,5000,14,28,15,78,4

"Give Mandy Spencer Time, Rid Lyme",https://www.gofundme.com/3tvl5pc,7,GOLDHILL,OR,For me  life has been filled with many joys and happy moments  a lot of ups and downs too  so when the trials and hard times come  it is very obvious to me  what really matters the most.My dear wife Mandy and I are coming upon our 23rd year of marriage.  The years we have spent together have been happy and blessed.  A little over 10 years ago  Mandy became sick with what seemed at first to be a common cold.  She came home from teaching a kindergarten class feeling under- the- weather and assumed that she had caught a cold from some of the kids that day.  During the next week and a half  Mandy had a severe sore throat and headaches  and was running a fever.  About 4 days into this burning sore throat  Mandy began to have tremendous pain and stiffness in her head  neck and spine.  The first concern was Meningitis  and she ended up in the E.R.  having to have a spinal tap as well as other tests.  When Meningitis was ruled out  we continued to see multiple specialists of different expertise in the valley as the pain continued to move down her arms and back  accompanied by numbness of various degrees  and eventually settled in her lower back  running down both legs and into her feet.  Mandy has always had back pain  due to some scoliosis and as we later found out  a tethered spinal cord  so she was accustomed to some pain. But the pain that she experienced and continues to experience through this trial was above and beyond her ability to manage.  She would lay shaking in bed  unable to perform basic tasks until doctors prescribed her narcotics  which would help to control the pain  enough that she was able to function.  Taking heavy pain medication was not something she wanted to do but she had not been able to find relief in any other way.  It has been extremely difficult for me  our four children and other family members  to see Mandy in such pain and anguish  so the promise of a resolve would be a great blessing.  Mandy has missed many activities/events  that most her healthy people her age would not have to give up  due to her unknown condition.  Our children have had to learn during the worst times  how to manage for themselves.  Much prayer  study  research and love has taught our family to not give up  persevere and to look at many other solutions and/or alternatives  along with modern medicine.  After numerous trips to the ER  many of the specialist in the Rouge Valley  including Rheumatologists  Neurologists  Nerve Specialists  Infectious disease specialists  etc.  the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota  Naturopathic clinics in Idaho  and multiple other clinics and doctors  both conventional and non-conventional  we were left without answers  frustrated  worried  and financially decimated.  Four years into this plight  we lost our home due to increasing debt  and in 2011 we filed and had to declare Medical Bankruptcy.  For 6 more years Mandy has been passed from one doctor to the next.  Each new doctor promised hope of a cure  or at least a path to feel better  again with no resolve.Over the 10 plus years of searching for help  Mandy has been tested numerous times for many well-known diseases  but in 2017 she had a very conclusive Western Blot test  (as well as a second test)  that revealed she was positive for Chronic Lyme disease.  Finally  something made sense.  Lyme disease is a very complex  invasive disease that mimics many other diseases (over 300) and had caused false-positive results on other tests.  Treatment to possibly rid Mandy of Lyme is very complex and very expensive.  There are several clinics in the US that have had results towards “curing” a person of Lyme  or at least helping heal the immune system so it can more adequately fight the disease  but most of the success stories we have found come from those who have gone to other countries  specifically Germany.Our path ahead to helping Mandy find a better quality of life is paved with huge financial obstacles  particularly because many of the treatments she needs are not covered by our health insurance.  We have been very blessed by the generosity of many people already  who have helped make it possible to pay some of our medical bills along the way.  Unfortunately  due to the cost of medical care and testing alone  has used up the generous donations thus far.  Because of some more recent decline in Mandy’s health  we have been urgently looking into care facilities that are very experienced in treating this disease in a more “all inclusive “ approach  using both conventional  as well as naturopathic  and other seemingly “non-conventional” approaches  that help detox  build the bodies immune system (which is currently fighting against instead of for the body)  as well as fighting the spirochete and multiple co-infections that have bombarded her body.  We feel a distinct urgency as time continues to pass  and more and more parts of Mandy’s body and mind continue to decline.  This disease not only attacks vital organs and joints  but one of its large targets is the brain and central nervous system.  Not only does Mandy experience scary episodes of brain inflammation and pain  but beyond the “brain fog” that is typically known by Lyme sufferers  she is increasingly losing memories  and details where she was once proficient.  My kids and me are asking for time  time with their mother and wife.  This requires money  money I do not have.  I am implored and humbled  to ask for monetary help  I know no other way.  If you feel so at this time  any donation would be appreciated tremendously.Thank you so much!Love  Garrett  Savannah  Chloe  Saige and Levi.,13560,25000,15,54,140,662,12

Help me SMILE bigger than ever! :),https://www.gofundme.com/Smilebiggerthanever,0,DENVER,CO,UPDATE: All my dental work has been completed and the appointment for braces is for March 4th!! I'm SUPER EXCITED and couldn't of done it without all of you. The last two weeks have been painful  physically and emotionally.  I see why my father has told me that insurance companies were a joke!! With that being said  I've already spent over two thousand ($2 000) dollars out of pocket for said dental work.AGAIN!! It wouldn't of happened without all of you! BUT THE REASON WE ARE ALL HERE... BRACES!!The braces are going on March 4th only because I can put 400 bucks down (Which is really what I have left in this account) and I will be responsible to pay $151.00 a month for 20 months...(Higher payments accepted  of course). So  to everyone who has already donated THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! I COULDN'T OF ACCOMPLISHED THIS MUCH WITHOUT ALL OF YOU.I have decided to keep my GOFUNDME going throughout the process updating all of you  of course. BUT also  to allow the continuing financial support throughout the 20 months.  This is going to be a journey and I just have to thank everyone for getting me this far! I SMILE! I smile behind my hands. I smile while looking down so no one catches a glance. I smile so big sometimes my teeth peek out of my lips and I just stop smiling. I want to show how happy I am without hiding my face. Over time  deep down  the insecurities of my appearance festered.  I usually found myself smiling with my mouth close in 99% of the pictures I was in or I usually opted out of pictures altogether.  So  I'm asking for financial help in my next endeavor  getting braces.To give some of you  if not most  a background of myself. I grew up in Queens  New York with a single father of five young girls  as  my mother passed away when I was only 5 years old.  I remember that day as if it were yesterday. Life as I knew it changed in that instant. My father refused to give up on us  and kept trucking on the best he could with what the world threw at him. We didn't have toothbrushes  or a routine.  He didn't reprimand us or make us go to school. But  he gave my surfing. ￼￼Surfing became my passion and I was damn good at it. I made the front page of the Metro Section of The New York Times when I was 16.  My dream was finally there at my fingertips.  But  I didn't fit the general physique of the typical girl  especially in the world of surfing. With my crooked teeth and my scrappy tom-boy presence my dreams slowly faded.  I couldn't be a rider for Roxy  or billabong. Who was I kidding. This was the first time in my life  I knew my teeth could hold me back. ( https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/01/nyregion/girl-uninterrupted.html )I branched out. I knew I needed some direction in my already chaotic life. So  I found adults that kept me on a pretty good path and only wanted what was best for me. I've been through two full Consultations for braces at an early age  all at the hand of others. I was even offered a discount  because awesome people at my High School had involved themselves. But  that dreading line  reserved for your guardian  was left unsigned. I became hopeless...still as a child  braces were there  left on the back burner  with all other the other permission slips. ￼￼This left me  right where I find myself today  shining the spot light on what matters  and that is FINALLY ME! I I quit smoking  started working out  and I even started running. I have goals  that normally I wouldn't even attempt to dream about and I'm going to smash everyone of them. MY TEETH ARE NEXT. ITS TIME! I'm asking for financial assistance in achieving my next goal. I have received another Consultation and this one is not going to be put on the back burner. 1st Impressions Orthodontics located in Westminster  Colorado has given my teeth a 18 month sentence behind some metal and I can't wait. Total amount for metal or clear braces: $5550Total discount given  with in-house insurance @ $99:  $1500Leaving me with a total cost of $4149This would mean the world to me! Looking forward to the day I'm no longer hiding MY smile. Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you to everyone who even reads this! ￼￼,2820,4000,15,71,56,272,4
Mary&#x2019;s Post Fall Care,https://www.gofundme.com/marys-post-fall-care-2019,6,FOUNTAINVALLEY,CA,Mary Williamson has lived with her daughter  Amy  son-in-law  Jim  and 4 grandkids for the past 3 years. On Dec 6th  Mary fell on her way to bed. She broke her right hip and upper right arm. Two days later  she had partial hip replacement but the doctors felt more surgery was too risky and opted to just let gravity heal her arm over time. A big concern of surgery at her age is that anesthesia can exacerbate dementia. It was apparent that the surgery had greatly affected her memory  however they were hopeful that time would help her get better. A few days after surgery  Mary was transferred from Kaiser hospital to a skilled nursing facility to work on physical rehabilitation. While at the facility  her dementia was still bad but she did recognize her favorite drawings that Danny had drawn from home and the stuffed Christmas toy that the kids had given her. Everyone felt that coming home would be the best for her mind and body to heal.Amy trained with the physical therapy team so that she knew how to transfer Mary from her bed to the wheelchair and how to help her exercise. A special van was arranged to move her home in her wheelchair to make the trip easier.On December 22nd  Jim and Amy met the wheelchair transport van at the facility  but as they walked up to the front door of the facility  Amy slipped on wet tile and fell  fracturing her left kneecap. As she was whisked off in an ambulance  Jim was left to get his mother-in-law home not knowing where his wife was even being taken.Since then  Jim  the kids and their wonderful neighbors and friends have been caring round the clock for Amy and her mother.  On Jan 4th  Amy had surgery on her kneecap which was broken in 2 pieces. She will have an immobilized brace for months and go through long term physical therapy to regain full use of her leg. In addition  the school where Amy teaches closed in December  so her injury has affected her ability to look for work and made her ineligible for unemployment.Mary’s care has strained the family financially and emotionally. She doesn’t recognize her family and gets confused and stressed easily. She requires physical and occupational care  nursing and memory care. Mary needs to move to a dementia care facility where they can help keep her safe while getting her stronger and ambulatory again. Please help this family to get their grandmother the care she needs.,540,7500,23,7,6,14,3

Police are still investigating so please pray that justice will be had.He's endured major damage to his airway  mouth  and jaw. He'll need major reconstruction to his mouth once his health has improved. Though his recovery thus far has been nothing short of miraculous  it will be a while before he is able to work again.

Amanda&apos;s Medical Costs,https://www.gofundme.com/amandascominghome,0,NEWNAN,GA,March of this year I had a gastric sleeve done  it healed great and I felt great. May 11th I started vomiting and didnt slow down until August but the damage was already done. I guess vomiting 10+ times a day  everyday isnt ideal. In that time I've been hospitalized 5 times for malnutrition and dehydration. In August it was so bad I ended up in the step down ICU with an NG tube pumping  the bile out of my stomach. Still I was sent home with no answers but to just deal with it. It was during this stay that i started to go numb in my hip  I was already very weak so walking was very hard. I got home the vomiting got better but I couldnt eat it was like my body was rejecting food. The numbness moved down each leg and up to my sternum  talk about scary thats it! Waking up to no use of your legs is a horrible feeling. In this time I fell 3 times just trying to get to the bathroom  the 3rd time I hurt myself pretty bad and had to call an ambulance to come help me. They ended up taking me to the hospital where I was admitted once again. I saw every type of doctor there was and nobody could explain the numbness. I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with the closest thing he could think of that this resembled  Guillain-Barre syndrome. He then went to the computer to put the orders in for the treatment for GB  while he was sitting there he said something told him to look at my lab work from where I had been admitted three weeks prior that is where he discovered that I have both wet and dry Beriberi (or simply a B1 deficiency). He immediately started me on oral and IV vitamin B1. Within a few days I already felt better but I still couldn't walk or move my legs. Piedmont made arrangements for me to be moved to the shepherd center in Atlanta. And if you know anything about this place they create miracles! I have been here 8 weeks and I can already walk a few feet with a walker.Now on to why I did a GoFundMe. If everything goes according to plan I will be coming home on the 27th of this month! There are several things that I need to purchase for my home health care set up  yes my insurance pays for some but not all of the things I need. And if you have ever looked into purchasing medical supplies it's not cheap. Also Ive lost 200 pounds so I only have a few pieces of clothing that fit me. Ive lost 30 pounds just being at the Shepherd Center! Any little bit helps and I appreciate it more than you know. Thank you so much for all the prayers and messages of encouragement they have helped me pull through some of the worse days I've ever been through.,1520,2000,9,76,16,140,5

Debbie was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer three and a half months ago.  Due to there being limited hospitals  doctors  specialist  etc on Maui  there have been huge delays in testing and getting treatment started..  unfortunately   Debbie has had no treatments thus far because of this. Debbie has decided to come to  the mainland for treatment at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Her first appointment is Wednesday May 16th.  Thankfully  Cancer Treatment Centers of America is paying to fly both Debbie and Ceto to the mainland for this appointment.  Debbie will have to stay in the area of Cancer Treatment Centers of America for several months while she goes through her therapy. Sadly  Debbie has no long or short term disability benefits through her employer.  She is looking at having  to stay in a motel during her treatments.  Can you imagine how the cost will add up?  Not only for the motel but food  transportation  co-pays as well as having to still pay her rent and utilities at home . We are estimating the cost to be near $10 000 per month.  As her friends and family  I'm sure you have either been to a party that she has hosted or perhaps been a guest in her home.  I don't have to tell you that she is the \hostess with the most-ess!\""   She and Ceto always make everyone feel welcome and at home .    (And you will never be hungry with Ceto around.)  Let's all pitch in and help Debbie while she is busy kicking cancer's butt! I'm sure the pressure of all of these expenses and no income during this time will only hinder her healing  so let's help!  Even small donations will add up and will certainly decrease their anxiety.

He has degenerative disc disorder which has cut off the circulation to his nerves in his back legs and bladder. The surgery was not as successful as hoped so now were depending completely on prayer  physical therapy and lots of love.  We are one month post operation and although he is not completely recovered  we are making progress. We have teamed with @high_rollers_club_hrc and are awaiting the arrival of his wheel chair. @high_rollers_club_hrs is 100% non profit. I’d like to take whatever’s left and donate it to them.

Thank you for taking a moment to read my post.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to put up a Go Fund Me page. I have always been able to work  albeit self employed for my entire life.  Recently a set of circumstances have slowed me down. I have two  kinds of Cancer. 1.) Primary Myelofibrosis and Lymphoma B. Sadly there is no remission. Levine Cancer Center has been great about managing my symptoms and I take Chemo pills called Jakafi and have a Chemo infusion every other month. I feel luckier then most people. Recently my roommate has moved out with his own set of issues.  I am hoping to stop Chemo  even though it is supposed to provide me with a longer life expectancy so I can try to find a job.  But until I can do that I am left with little monies. This is embarassing to come with my hat in my hand but that is what I am doing. Thank you for reading this. Please pray for me.for reading this. God bless you all.,475,25000,9,2,6,52,8
Juntos por Carolina Delgado Linero,https://www.gofundme.com/juntos-por-carolina-delgado-linero,3,MIAMI,FL,Hola  soy Angélica  resido en los Estados Unidos. Mi prima Carolina Delgado  es educadora en la localidad de Zaraza en Venezuela y está viviendo momentos muy difíciles por temas de salud. Desde octubre de 2017 al presentar un síndrome diarreico severo  con sangrado y dolor  acude a un internista  quien refiere a Gastroenterólogo al descartar amibiasis. Al persistir las molestias e intuyendo que es un cuadro hemorroidal  le realizan una colonoscopia  descubriendo un LOE obstructuvoen recto bajo  por lo cual es referida a la ciudad de Caracas para ser evaluada por otros especialista en oncología y gastroenterología. Después de estudios de laboratorio  biopsia y tomográficos le fue diagnosticado un adenocarcinoma de recto medio ST-III. De inmediato arrancó tratamiento de Radioterapia y Quimioterapia que consistió en Capecitabina a dosis de 825mg/m2 VO y Oxaliplatino a la dosis de 50 mg/m2 EV  precedido de medicaciones de Ondasentron  Dexametasona y Ranitidina  para manejo de toxicidad aguda  así como de Neupogen 300 mcg SC para mantener densidad de dosis. Este en 4 ciclos previos a la realización de cirugía para extraer el tumor. Además  haciendo la salvedad que posterior a la operación debía retomar otros 6 ciclos más de quimioterapia oral e intravenosa.Arranca el 2018 con la meta de buscar los fondos para la operación. Y llegaron gracias al esfuerzo de una larga cadena de familiares  amigos  amigos de nuestros amigos y de la familia  además de personas que ya han pasado por esta situación  organizaciones benéficas sin fines de lucro y organismos del estado. Para marzo le realizan la operación para extraerle el tumor  teniendo que también hacerle  por el lugar donde se localizó el cáncer  una ileostomía (colostomía) temporal. Este procedimiento fue todo un éxito de la mano de un maravilloso grupo de médicos. Sin embargo debió tener esta colostomía mientras duró su tratamiento oncológico (quimioterapia oral e intravenosa) post cirugía. Acudimos a esta vía de obtener los fondos para que Carolina pueda realizarse un segunda cirugía para cerrar la ileostomía  ya después de haber finalizado su tratamiento en agosto y que así vuelva a eliminar los desechos de su cuerpo de manera convencional.

Ninah &amp; Bobs House Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/ninah-an-bobs-house-repairs,2,LAKESIDE,CA,Dear friends and family On September 24  2018 a driver of a very large SUV drove into Ninah and Bob’s home causing extensive damage to more than half of their house.  They are a retired couple living on a fixed income and due to the extent of the damage it will likely be many months of repairs  and renovations.  Because the driver was uninsured most of the cost of the repairs will fall on them.  There may be lawyer fees that will need to be covered as well.Ninah and Bob have always been kind  helpful  and supportive to their friends in need. I am hoping we can all show them our love and gratitude for their support in years past by contributing to the fund that will help rebuild their home.,3920,25000,14,16,14,74,6
Maria&#x2019;s fight against Rett Syndrome,https://www.gofundme.com/marias-fight-against-rett-syndrome,7,MASPETH,NY,Hello and thank you all for taking the time to read.  I am starting this fund for my niece Maria who lives in Romania. Maria is a vibrant little 4 year old who puts a smile on the faces of everyone she meets.  Over the past year  Maria has been hospitalized multiple times  has seen numerous doctors and specialists and has had endless tests in hopes of finding a diagnosis for her unexplainable symptoms.  Finally a neurologist diagnosed Maria with Rett Syndrome. Rett Syndrome is a brain disorder that most often affects healthy little girls from the age of 6-18 months  leaving them with severe disabilities for life.  Symptoms include seizures  loss of speech  motor functions and ability to walk.  This is a devastating disease that no parent should have to watch their child go though.  Endless hours of research about this condition has helped Maria’s parents better understand this condition as well as treatment options. They were referred to a clinic in England that specializes only in children with Rett Syndrome.  While there is no cure  treatments are available to improve overall function and address immediate symptoms. Maria and her family will have to relocate to England in order for Maria to receive the treatment she so desperately needs.  The expense for treatments  medications and overall living will be a immense struggle for the family but it is a sacrifice that they will make without question.   As a parent I can only imagine how helpless they must feel.  Let’s help Maria and her family get a head start on what will be a lifelong battle.Thank you all for your kindness.  And most importantly Maria thanks you.,1415,5000,8,28,21,230,7
Help bring Lizzy home,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpBringLizzyHome,6,SUPPLY,NC,Help me bring Lizzy home.  I came home from work the afternoon of October 31st  and found my 5 year old dachshund paralyzed from the middle of her back down  and in severe pain. I rushed her to the animal emergency hospital. She had to have emergency surgery right then. Her L2 and L3 had ruptured in her back and was crushing her spinal cord. After the surgery  I was told that she may never regain any motor skills to her back end. ( I had taken her to the vet for pain  7 times in the three weeks prior to this  and this was not found)  After a week in the hospital  Lizzy started showing signs of sensation in her back.  Slowly after that she began to move her tail very slightly. I was in tears  of joy. She had to go through physical therapy everyday  and could not come home. I received a call yesterday from her physical therapist and she was in tears. Lizzy could stand up on her back legs and take a couple of steps. I was moved to tears again  The hospital called me that afternoon and said   if Lizzy continues this   she can come home Friday or Saturday. I have to have this money to pay them  or she can not come home. Please help me to reach this. It is going to cost me $5 000.00 With all the prayers and heartache that I have endured   please  please think of Lizzy and help me to bring her home. You can also pay directly to Animal Emergency and Trauma center.  910-791-7387. Lizzy Howard. The vet that done her surgery was Dr. Ned William's.,240,5000,11,5,8,53,5
Help Karen Heal Stage 4 Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/6nhtj-help-karen-heal-stage-4-cancer,1,VISTA,CA,"Vicki Parzyk's message:Hi Friends  For a long time I have wanted to start an out reach called Project Brave Girl (PBG) to help women who are facing real challenges in their life. They fight the odds... they stand strong in the eye of the storm... they are BRAVE GIRLS. As a fellow Christian  I cannot let them walk through the storm alone... But Gods love gives hope  grace  peace  strength  healing and incredible courage with family and friends and the community that faith builds. I hope you would agree that telling their stories will help others too. This is my first story for Project Brave Girl. My sweet friend Karen has stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasize to her lymph nodes  bones  ovaries and liver. After reoccurring breast infections the tumor has broken through her skin causing severe discomfort and pain. The treatment her doctors and her have agreed is best for her is not covered by insurance. She has exhausted all of her financial resources at this time. Her personalized treatment plan will consist of immune building/cancer killing IV treatments three days a week and low-dose chemo therapy the other two days. Treatment lasts three weeks  maybe four. Treatment is needed as soon as possible once funds are raised. This personal treatment plan was developed off of her results from genetic testing  which showed which chemotherapy agents and supplements are the most powerful and effective at killing \her\"" cancer  hence those will be used. This type of chemo utilizes insulin to trick the cancer to gobble up the chemo without affecting healthy cells. There are minimal side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy. This protocol also has a high survival rate for stage 4 cancer patients. It will be the quickest way towards remission and for her to regain her health and become self-sufficient and able to provide for herself again. For a couple of weeks Karen and I have been praying and asking God for a Big Mountain to move out of her way. Funds are needed for her to start this three to four week treatment  she will also need a PICC line for the IV's  after treatment expenses in the form of supplements  follow up genetic testing and any supportive IVs that may be needed. With this being Breast Cancer awareness month we knew this to be for “such a time as this” moment to step out in faith and be bold. It is also my hope that this post will be shared out to help spread the word... for Karen is one of the bravest girls I know. I want her to know she is not alone. So please join me in supporting her in this journey of faith  provision and healing. She is a child of God  and she needs our help. Thank you in advance  ❤️Vicki Parzyk #projectbravegirlKaren Hopper's message: I'm so grateful to have met Vicki. Our meeting was definitely the work of God. I am blessed to be a part of Project Brave Girl  as a recipient now and a supporter in the future. I want to give a special shout out to C3 Church and the amazing people who supported me and held me high in prayer. When I came to their North campus in May  I was broken. I was depressed. I had experienced the hardest year of my life  financially  physically and emotionally. I lost sight of God  but that all changed thanks to C3. Miracles started to happen  friendships were born and I saw God start to work in my life. Prayers were being answered when I thought there was no possible way. But there is always a way through God. Although this is a fundraiser to raise money for my medical cancer treatment  it's really not about the money at all. It is bigger than that. It's about \""people helping people\"". It's about God. It's about faith. It's about compassion and support for one another. Everyone has gone through a hard time at some point in their life and it has been placed on my heart to find a way to make sure no one is ever alone when they need help... especially when it is too hard for them to ask... which I can relate to. I want to turn my \""pain\"" into \""purpose\"" and to use it to help others. Through Project Brave Girl  we can do this. We can change and save one life at a time. I believe God is already healing me. I know he has put the perfect treatment plan in my path. I know I will be a testimony of God and one day I will share my story. Thank you for your support... I send love  hugs and blessing to you. ❤️ Karen Hopper""",3779,20000,11,19,37,280,6

I require this money in order to move to my new location. This will pay for the moving fees  my deposit  and my first months rent. My roomate let me know without warning that he was going to be leaving in January after I got back from Pax Unplugged. I really wanted to stay where I am but finding a new place was easier than trying to get someone to live with me here within three weeks. A few months ago we helped a friend of mine get out of an abusive living situation. She inspired me to raise money for  http://safehousenv.org/ an amazing organization to donate to. She heard about my moving situation and introduced me to a mutal friend of hers who was looking for a room mate. We met up and hit it off and I am thankfully set to move in January 1st. This goes to show you that love keeps giving and a rising tide lifts all boats. I am happy she is in a safer place and has helped me find a place to call my own again as well. If you have any questions my direct messages are always open. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. There are just simply not enough words to say thank you. I have moved over 3 teams in the past 3 years. Those of you that know me well know how stressfull this has been for me.

Lauro is  getting his Kidney!,https://www.gofundme.com/lauros-getting-his-kidney,3,WICHITA,KS,As many of you know my brother Lauro is in much need of a kidney transplant! And finally the day has come! He will be undergoing surgery on 10/30/18!On October 13  2013 my brother Lauro was diagnosed with polycystic disease and complete kidney failure.  It was a heartbreaking reality for our family as Lauro didn’t have insurance.  Our mother was willing and ready to donate her kidney the moment he was diagnosed  unfortunately she  Was not a match!  Thanks to his social worker at Via Christi  we were referred to the National Kidney Foundation where he has been blessed with health insurance that covers his medications and dialysis while on the transplant list.  Through the foundation  we learned about Kidney Donor Chains – this process allows our mother to donate her kidney to someone in need and my brother will receive a kidney from a different donor who is a perfect match!The transplant is scheduled for October 30th2018  a day we have been waiting and praying for 5 long years to come.  After his transplant he will no longer qualify for assistance from the National Kidney Foundation.  We are asking for your blessings to help cover post-operative medical costs and living expenses since Lauro will not be able to work for weeks.  Lauro looks forward to living a healthy strong life and to be there for his kids.  Traducción El 13 de Octubre de 2013  a mi hermano Lauro se le diagnosticó una enfermedad poliquística e insuficiencia renal completa. Fue una realidad desgarradora para nuestra familia ya que Lauro no tenía seguros salud. Nuestra madre estaba dispuesta y lista para donar su riñón en el momento en que fue diagnosticado  ¡desafortunadamente ella no era compatible!  Gracias a su trabajador social en Via Christi  nos remitieron a la Fundación Nacional del Riñón  donde ha sido bendecido con un seguro de salud que cubre sus medicamentos y diálisis mientras estaba en la lista de trasplantes. A través de la fundación  aprendimos sobre las Cadenas de Donantes de Riñones: este proceso le permite a nuestra madre donar su riñón a alguien que lo necesite y mi hermano recibirá un riñón de un donante diferente que es una compatible. El trasplante está programado para el 30 de Octubre de 2018  un día por el que hemos estado esperando y rezando durante los uñtimos 5 años. Después de su trasplante  ya no será elegible para recibir ayuda de la National Kidney Foundation. Estamos pidiendo sus bendiciones para ayudar a cubrir los costos médicos y los gastos de la vida después de la operación  ya que Lauro no podrá trabajar durante semanas. Lauro espera vivir una vida sana y fuerte y estar allí para sus hijos!,3045,4000,7,76,40,484,6
Help Yolanda Fight Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-yolanda-fight-breast-cancer,1,SEVIERVILLE,TN,I am Yolanda  and I have been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Cancer in my right breast. There is a lump present now at about 3.4 centimeters in size and has also spread to several lymph nodes near my right arm pit. I will be undergoing Chemo Therapy for the next 5 months. The purpose of doing the long series of Chemo treatments is to shrink the cancerous lumps in my breast and lymph nodes as much as possible before surgery. The doctors say that doing it this way will minimize the invasiveness of the surgery. After the 5 months of Chemo Therapy  the plan is for me to have surgery to remove the cancerous lump from my breast and also many of the lymph nodes around my right arm pit. This procedure they are planning to do on me is called a lumpectomy. A few weeks after the surgery is completed  I am scheduled to take daily Radiation Treatments for a long while to insure that all of the cancer is eliminated in the area.My team of doctors tell me that this entire process will take approximately 1 year to complete. Although my employers have been very gracious in allowing me to work when I am able  due to my treatments and surgery  there will be times when I will not be able to work. I just started my first Chemo Therapy treatment (on 10-2-2018) and  in the last month  along with various hospital tests and doctor appointments  I have already had to miss some work.My husband of 31 years  Ken Fletcher  and I are looking to God for His healing  wisdom  direction  and provision throughout this challenging time in our lives. We have already seen God do amazing things for us since we first found out about the cancer. We are so thankful for what the Lord has done and is continuing to do.I am publishing this page so that you  who may want to join with us financially  can do so here. The funds that you give will be used to help with bills and expenses that will be coming in throughout the year of my treatment.I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love and support  your prayers  and for your financial help during this time in my life.  With love  Yolanda,725,10000,7,7,15,197,7

Fundraiser for medical expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/help-victoria-find-healing,0,FRESNO,CA,This is my Victoria  most of you know her and undoubtedly love her. But for those who don’t know her  let me tell you.. she’s full of life  so strong  opinionated  she’s a great forgiver  a bit of a nerd (and proud of it)   she’s a jokester  a leader  She has a huge heart for everyone but especially for those who are ever in need. She’s 13  She loves Photography  Comic Books  People (especially the Elderly)  Dogs  Food  Dancing  Music and most importantly  Jehovah God. Right before she became sick  she had set her career path to become a mechanical engineer and enrolled at a dual-enrollment high school that allows her the opportunity to graduate high school with her associates degree.  She was elated! On June 25th 2018 she called me at work to tell me that she had woken up to her arms and legs shaking. That day we went to the hospital.  After tons of blood tests and an MRI of her Brian  she was sent home with no answers. We were told that she wasn’t expressing any signs of stress but that this must be stressed induced because there was no virus present and that maybe she has just suppressed a memory and so I should get her to a psychologist. That Friday I took her to a naturopath clinic for more labs. They said it would take two weeks to get results so we went home and waited for the results while watching her become severely fatigued to the point that she needed help eating  walking and bathing. After 1 week and her continued decline  we ended up at another hospital. After a spinal tap  they said that her white blood cell count was normal so there must not be a virus and chalked it up to stress (never even sent the blood to the labs to be tested). That neurologist said get therapy and come back in 6 months. By this point she had lost her ability to speak  there was no explanation for that either. So  naturopath clinic ended up finding EBV. We took those labs to a Chinese medicine doctor who diagnosed her with Chronic Meningitis. She was treated locally for that and it is no longer present in her body at yet she is still sick and shaking. Since the beginning her pediatrician has been sending “emergency” requests to multiple neurologists for an EEG to no avail.. We have seen several naturopaths who have each given us a different diagnosis and have treated her with herbs and frequencies. Her energy levels and appetite have at times improved however despite that her nervous system has continued to decline. She suffers from constant headaches  sensitivity to sounds  insomnia  rashes  trouble walking and focusing  nausea  etc.. As of two weeks ago we’ve been told by 3 different doctors that they believe she is experiencing seizures and is now believed to have an advanced stage of Lyme Disease that has spread to her brain and is causing damage to her nervous system and needs immediate  aggressive treatment.  We are currently in Reno  NV.  (on donated funds and 3 different credit cards) to see a special clinic known for helping people with Lyme disease and other very severe illnesses. We were referred here by a very credible source and after meeting with the doctor and his staff here as well as some of the patients  I feel this is the best opportunity for her to get properly diagnosed and treated. Hence  my call out for help. This clinic has a great reputation of finding and treating otherwise “undiscoverable” conditions however  they use natural medicine to do so. What that means  is that our health insurance won’t cover any labs or treatments offered here. I know that we all work hard for what we need and we all have responsibilities to attend to so it is hard for me to ask for help but I’ve learned in the past few months that I have to ask for help because we simply cannot get her the tests and treatments that she needs because Unfortunately the tests and treatments here run anywhere from 3k to 5k per week. The treatment plan is designed for anywhere from 4-8 weeks. This includes very aggressive detox  killing of the virus  rebuilding of her immune system  treatments for her brain to begin to heal  amongst many forms of therapies and supplements for all of her individual organs to heal  etc. She really misses her friends  being in school  sharing in the preaching work  flat ironing her hair and singing & dancing like a normal 13 yr old girl should. As a mom it hurts me to not be able to get her back to that so i’ve been humbled to the point of having to ask for help for her sake.  We have received help from so many of our friends in the past few months for which we are extremely grateful and that kindness will never ever be forgotten. In fact  that kindness got us in a position to be here seeking diagnosis. Unfortunately this new path for treatment will be out of our reach without again  asking for help. That being said  If you are  in a position to help  we will be eternally grateful and can only promise to pay it forward when the opportunity arises.,4060,30000,7,14,49,609,7
Help Seth Heal,https://www.gofundme.com/help-seth-heal,7,SEATTLE,WA,Thank you for stopping by our campaign! Donors like you are invaluable in helping our loved ones during their hardest times.The Backstory:On September 1st  while sleeping  Seth suffered a stroke. He woke up confused and unable to move his right side. Immediately  he called an ambulance and spent the next four days in the hospital.The damage that occurred affected the left side of Seth’s brain. While doctors are still searching for what would cause a stroke in this healthy 40 year old man  Seth is spending his time giving his all to a lengthy recovery process.While Seth’s gross motor skills have returned quickly  his fine motor skills have been compromised completely. Relearning to write  eat  draw  and essentially  do anything with one’s hands is an all-consuming task.The Recovery Process:For Seth  this is possibly the most vital mission of his life yet.Seth’s entire life is art. He has spent his entire professional career working with his hands on a range of artistic endeavors. With a BFA from Academy of Art in San Francisco  he has worked all over the country as a graphic designer  illustrator  designer  painter  and much more. Seth never stops creating—he is truly overflowing with talent. His personal projects are even more compelling than his top notch commercial work (please look at the photos we have posted—they are amazing!).Between speech therapy  physical therapy  occupational therapy  and continued testing for the root cause of the stroke  Seth has used all of his PTO and his medical bills are beginning to really add up. Additionally  Seth has a mortgage that must also continue to be paid.We have started this campaign to help Seth heal  and recover the functions he has lost without the interference of life’s extra stressors. We want to help Seth because (in addition to his artistic gifts) he is a true example of a genuine  wonderful person. Compassionate  engaging  and always ready to listen—those who know Seth know they are lucky to have him in their life.Throughout his ordeal  Seth has not lost his ability to laugh (and throw out some great  well-timed jokes). His steadfast optimism is truly inspiring.  How YOU Can Help:Donations made to this campaign will be used to help Seth pay his medical bills and costs associated with the different forms of therapy needed to fully restore his fine motor skills. Every dollar donated is crucial to help Seth heal  so please give any amount that is comfortable for you!To help us get the word out  you can share our link to your Facebook Timeline!

Jim &amp; Xan Donaldson and family,https://www.gofundme.com/jim-amp-xan-donaldson-and-family,0,LITTLETON,CO,Jim and Xan Donaldson are like my second parents.  Their daughter  Brandi  has been my very best friend since I was 15.  On Friday  9/28  they departed for St. George  Utah for the weekend to attend the wedding of their granddaughter.  When they arrived at the hotel  Jim fell while chasing after a luggage cart in the parking lot.  When he fell  he landed on a curb and the luggage cart fell on top of him  causing serious injuries which were and are exacerbated by previous trauma and health issues.  He has been in the hospital in Utah ever since (going on day 10 and day 7 in the ICU) and will be there for the foreseeable future as his injuries have been described by the trauma doctor as consistent with being crushed by a car. We have no idea when Jim will be able to come home as his condition is serious.  He had made some progress in recent days only to take a turn for the worse which has left everything up in the air.  (Updates from Brandi posted below—as you can see  his injuries are serious and progress is slow.  I also just heard from her this morning and Jim is on his way into surgery for a tracheostomy  a feeding tube  and possible plating of his ribs—I will continue to post updates as I get them)I’m asking for immediate help for them and their family on a multitude of levels.   Obviously  Xan has been there by his side since all of this happened which means she’s unable to be at work and is staying in a hotel.  They are going to need a tremendous amount of help not only covering the hotel stay (and eating out every meal)  but also regular expenses for their household here in Littleton.  In addition to Xan being there since this happened  Brandi has been as well and has also been unable to work.  There will be expenses for travel back and forth as she has a family and work here that she has to attend to and she will also have to get back to Utah to support her mom and Jim in his recovery.  Any support you can give is tremendously appreciated.  They have been through so much in recent years and would never ask for a bit of help from anyone.   As you can imagine  this has left them all reeling.  It is difficult to deal with this kind of accident at home  but being in another state just adds to the difficulty and trauma and expense.  Thank you so much for reading and considering!  All my love Sarah EdmondsUPDATES FROM BRANDI:UPDATE ON MY DAD (Sunday 9/30) - For those of you who don't know  my dad (Jim) took a fall on Friday night. He was running after a luggage cart (we're in Utah for my niece's wedding) and when he caught up to it  he lost his balance and fell into a curb. Then the luggage cart fell on top of him. His injuries are far worse than they should be because he has osteoporosis. The pulmonologist says that it looks like he's been crushed by a car. He has 7 broken ribs and a broken clavicle on the right side and 3 broken ribs on the left. He also has a fracture in his sternum and bruising on his lungs. Because of these injuries and his preexisting sarcoidosis  his lungs are compromised. Obviously  it hurts to breathe with broken ribs  so to get him to use his lungs fully they have given him an epidural in his thoracic region and lots of pain meds. It's given him so much relief. Unfortunately  he's still retaining too much co2. They thought the bi-pap machine would help that but it hasn't  so last night they put a breathing tube in. It's already brought his co2 levels down a little. So now we wait through the weekend and see if Kaiser wants to fly him home. Please do your work  prayer warriors  love and light givers  and positive thought senders! I'll update tomorrow. Love to you all.——————UPDATE (Monday 10/1)- My dad is doing well on the breathing tube. His co2 levels are much better. However  we found out that his right lung (the side that took the brunt of the trauma) has partially collapsed. The docs put a tube in that lung this morning to help it out and it seems to be doing the job. They've decided  because the hospital is in the insurance network and because he's not stable enough  to keep him here in Utah in the ICU. They are still not sure about surgery  if his bones are strong enough and if it would just be more trauma to his already traumatized body. It's pretty much a waiting game to see how well his lungs are able to heal and breathe on their own. If they aren't  chances are they'll proceed with the tracheostomy. Thanks for the continued prayers and love. We can feel it!  ——————Update (Wednesday 10/3) - Wow! Thank you all for the prayers  love  light  positive thoughts  and good juju. It is palpable.There isn't too much to report today. Jim is still on the ventilator and still has his chest tube in. The doctors say that it's a very  very slow process. Wait and see. His heart rate was extremely high last night and they weren't able to bring it down with meds. It was still high this morning  so the doctors did a cardioversion (shocked his heart) to restart the heart and correct the high heart rate. It worked for now but there's always a chance it could be needed again. Jim was agitated and confused when he asked for a ride to the airport and we had to remind him that he's here for the long haul. There's this thing called ICU delirium and that is no joke. The staff does their best to keep his days and nights on schedule but it IS the ICU and that's difficult most times. So  it's our job to keep him awake and his mind busy during the day. He's able to sit in a chair (with much assistance) and likes to watch the news. But most of the time even the littlest amount of activity wears him out. We love the few moments where he's lucid enough to give us a thumbs up or wink at us.I'm staying here until this coming Tuesday. I have to get back to my clients for a week or so. I'll fly back as soon as I can. Mom is staying put of course. Please keep her in your prayers as well  especially in the times when we can't be here to support her.——————UPDATE (Saturday 10/6) - The last few days have been eventful! Jim's chest tube came out yesterday! His heart went back into that A-fib rhythm so they had to cardiovert him again. It was successful and he's on meds to help keep that heart rate down  hopefully for good this time. Mom and I walked in this morning to see that they had taken out his breathing tube! Yay!!! He's still finding his voice and his throat is very sore  but it's so good to hear him talk. Now they will test him to see if he can swallow water without coughing. The first attempt wasn't successful. The nurse will try again tonight. They have turned his epidural off and will take it out later today. He's now getting pain management through his IV. I think he's really starting to feel those broken ribs. If today goes well and his breathing stays on this upward trend  he gets moved out of ICU tomorrow! We're still not sure when he'll be able to come home but his trauma doc says maybe within the week. Mom and I will more than likely drive him back. A few more milestones have to be reached before that though. Once we get home  the road to rehabilitation will be a long one. My dad is so strong though  I have no doubt that he'll be just fine! TODAY IS A GOOD DAY!!!!! Thanks again for surrounding our family in love! We couldn't keep going without it. ——————UPDATE (Sunday 10/7) - My mom and I got a call from the doctor this morning. Jim had a rough night and his lungs were really full of mucus when the doc checked on him. They put the breathing tube back in immediately so they could suction him and clean out his lungs. They did a biopsy and culture on all of the crap they took out. No results from that yet. The trauma doctors came in to discuss (once again) plating his ribs and still aren't sure that's the way to go. It does look like they will be doing a tracheostomy tomorrow if his numbers are better  and possibly a feeding tube in his belly to get rid of the one in his nose. Right now  the most important thing is that he doesn't develop pneumonia. He's been sedated and resting all day. Two steps forward  one step back. Today was his step back  and that's okay.

A time of need for Patricia Strelecki,https://www.gofundme.com/memorial-for-james-strelecki,8,JENISON,MI,Pat's husband  Jim  of 47 years passed away in October.  Pat has been trying to adjust to life without her partner.  Trying to work with the VA to get what is deserved  since Jim was in the Navy  has not been easy.  Jim had a truck that he leased but when he passed that responsibility was put onto Pat.  She is no position to maintain that lease payment. She turned the truck into auction but that didn't bring enough money to pay off the lease.   We are seeking $6000 to help cover the difference of the buyout of the lease and to help Pat out of another situation that she cannot deal with.  Pat has made many adjustment in her budget to make living more simple but this has put a burden that she cannot handle on her own.  We ask for whatever help you may be able to offer.  We are hoping to have this situation handle by the end of March.  Thank you i n advance for your help.,1105,6000,17,18,16,61,2
Becky&apos;s Cancer Treatment Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/5g4xyh-becky039s-medical-bills,1,CASTLEROCK,CO,Meet Becky Morrison. She is a mother of two and grandmother of three. Alongside her recently-departed husband John  Becky worked tirelessly throughout her whole life until her retirement in 2015. She is currently battling cancer  both physically and financially. After many years of supporting her husband in his battle with progressively severe health issues  John’s battle ended in January 2018 and a new battle began for Becky  almost simultaneously. Shortly after John’s passing  Becky was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer stage 4. Add the additional losses of Becky’s brother and father all within the same year  Becky has endured a difficult time to say the least. She currently helps take care of her own mother while centering her life around hospital visits  rarely having the time  money or physical energy to visit her children and grandchildren. As the hospital  doctor  and chemo treatment bills have come in  it is very clear that this is no cost that any one person should ever have to bear alone. While what we have set out for a goal is no small ask  it is only a small portion of her needs. Thank you for considering supporting Becky in this fight. Any help that you are able to provide will be much appreciated. Sharing Becky’s story is also a tremendous help.,3867,50000,17,8,33,122,6
GoFundLee: Boobs are Weird,https://www.gofundme.com/gofundlee-boobs-are-weird,6,CHICAGO,IL,Hey! I'm Lee  a super gay trans nerd & I need your help. I have finally  after years of waiting  scheduled top surgery in December. I socially transitioned about five years ago- which means I have been binding for as long. This has lead to possibly permanent issues with my back and shoulders. Couple that with the fact that boobs are weird & I don't want mine anymore (never really did) and it was time to stop putting off this surgery. Also  I'm a bartender  which means I don't have the kind of insurance that will cover ANY of the costs. To make matters worse  I just found out the bar I've been working at for the last year and a half is closing... which sucks. So  literally anything you can do to help would be amazing.,2185,7000,14,31,43,220,7
Basic needs during treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/basic-needs-during-treatment,5,COLUMBUS,OH,Hello Thank you for taking the time to read this in our sons time of need.As some of you may now  Michaels daily life for the past 3 years has been difficult since he has had to overcome various challenges as the result of a serious car accident that he was injured in. This occurred while he was on duty serving in the Air Force and as a result a line of duty report was filed and approved with the Air Force. Unfortunately all medical claims for this accident have been denied. Due to the mounting medical bills he has accrued as a result in addition to daily expenses  we have started this fundraiser so that he will be able to pay his basic needs such as rent  car payment  utilities and food during these rounds of treatment that his doctor has referred him to go though so that he is able to continue to serve in the Air Force and return to school. While undergoing these treatments he will not be able to work and will not have any Military benefits to support him. His first round will be daily for 1 and half months in a hyperbaric chamber in Columbus to help heal his head and then he will be traveling to the Veterans Affairs Polytrauma Center In Richmond Virginia where they will be able to more accurately diagnose and treat his head injury. The Polytrauma center see’s patients on a case by case basis so he will need to plan to be there for as long as they say he needs to be.  Having exhausted his emergency fund  we are only able to assist him to a point  as much as we would like to pay for everything that is just not possible. He is applying for financial assistance through the Air Force and various charities but that has only covered a small amount of the basic essential funds. Thank you again for taking the time to read and considering donating. Any amount may it be 1 dollar or 1000 dollars makes a difference. Tim and Susie Klenk,325,3500,12,9,6,39,7
Braden Radziwon Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/braden-radziwon-medical-bills,9,LIBERTYHILL,TX,As many of you know Braden Radziwon was in a 4-Wheeler accident this past weekend.  He is currently recovering at Dell Children’s Hospital in Austin.  This gofundme account has been created to help raise money for the impending medical bills. Ryan and Melanie were really uncomfortable with the idea of this but recognize the need for help!  Radizwon’s have a $3000 deductible and are responsible for 30% of the remaining expenses.  We called the health insurance company yesterday and she estimated minimum out of pocket between 15K and 20K for this year  then the deductible resets in January.  They could use a little help from their friends and family!  They are asking above anything that you pray for Braden and his recovery.  This is what Melanie posted on FB about the accident:Braden was in a four wheeler accident involving a barbed wire fence. He has lacerations/deep wounds on his neck  chest  abdomen  arms  hands  and upper legs. The surgeon said he’s one of the toughest kids he’s met  and lucky to be alive. 40 staples and 30 stitches. I can’t show pictures of his wounds because it’s just too gruesome with kids possibly seeing it. He had surgery tonight  repairing a severed nerve and removing debris  puss  and grass. He’ll be at Dell Children’s for a minimum of two more days  monitoring infection. May need to go in again for his leg  which we should know within the next few days. Infectious disease and wound care will visit him tomorrow. He’s been given top-notch care  and we’re so thankful to have him here. Braden  you’re our world. Please pray for our brave boy’s recovery.❤️ And thank you to our amazing community who have brought meals  watched our kids  sent gifts  stayed at the hospital with us during surgery  visited Braden  sent texts and emails from friends  family and teachers. We are humbled and grateful.This is a tangible way to help the Radziwon's.  Go Fund Me no longer takes their 5% fee so aside from the credit card transaction fees and .30 cents per donation  most of the money donated will go to the Radziwon's.,11465,15000,22,76,82,207,7
SUPPORT JOSEPH NAVALTA,https://www.gofundme.com/support-joseph-navalta,7,LODI,NJ,About 25 years ago when I heard Kuya Joseph Navalta speak  and encouraged us young Unificationists to believe in God's heart that He forgave our mistakes  and a new clean life was ahead of us.  I also saw him educate hundreds of police officers and fellow educators/academia  into better citizens. A few days ago  however we received a news that he fell into diabetic coma but has since regained consciousness. As a complication of his diabetes  he had lost vision on his left eye  and doctors will try to save the remaining vision on the right eye but his operation was placed on hold when it was deemed dialysis was eminent to stabilize and save his life. The first treatment was done Oct 3rd and subsequent treatments 3x a wk for life is necessary. He is currently at Manila Doctor's Hospital. It is time for us to give back to this prolific educator. I heard even though with very minimal vision he had  he continues to give lectures with the help of his wife browsing the materials for him. Many of us  now from all over the world have benefited  been inspired and led a better thru his guidance and genuine education. Let's give back to this very humble  life-long true educator. All proceeds will go to his family as he goes thru his eye operation and dialysis treatments. We're also aware that our home country  does not carry a good health insurance system that covers these costly treatments. Thank you for your prayers  wishes and any financial contributions!,1100,1000,4,110,20,436,6
Help Brad Gamble Come Home,https://www.gofundme.com/help-brad-gamble-come-home,6,LAKEHOPATCONG,NJ,My friend Brad is continuing his fight against cancer.  His saga began in 2008 with the removal of a grapefruit sized brain tumor.  4 years later  the tumor had returned and was removed again.  Those two surgeries left Brad permanently disabled and unable to work.  Fast forward to Sept. 2018  another 20 hours of surgery to remove numerous tumors from his lower brain stem and spine  he has been left severely handicapped and in a wheelchair.  Brad is currently doing his best to recover some function in a rehabilitation facility but it will be a long road filled with great pain  effort and continuing cancer treatment.  His home requires extensive renovation to provide handicap access and after a decade of paying down the outrageous medical bills from the first two surgeries and treatments  his family simply does not have the necessary funds to complete the work.  Not to mention the ongoing costs of visiting nurse and home care services once he does come home.  Over the years  Brad  his wife Debbie and their exceptional daughters  Sam and Jess  have been there for me (and a lot of other people) whenever needed.  I am starting this GoFundMe page to try and give something back.  Following rehab  Brad will be temporarily staying with his very generous mother-in-law   Anne Meisner while we get his house ready.  Anne will also be acting as the beneficiary of this campaign for the purpose of collecting and dispersing the funds.  Please help us bring Brad home where he can be with his family.,8780,15000,18,59,88,300,7
Help ALMA care for our elders,https://www.gofundme.com/btu5u-help-plantpals-help-elders,7,LOSANGELES,CA,"WATCH THE VIDEO Aging  in our society is a source of grief and anxiety and an incredibly isolating experience. Many older adults lead disconnected lives even in group residential settings. We are a social species  it's hard wired into our brains and when unmet has negative physical  psychological  and neurological effects. Research has shown the extreme consequences loneliness has in our older years:  cognitive decline  depression  and even death.Enter ALMA :  an arts and healing initiative started by Dance/ Movement Therapist   Julia Grace Vishnepolsky   with a mission to spread the healing power of the arts  reconnect generations  and end isolation in longterm care. ALMA  stands for 'Addressing Loneliness through Movement and Art'   and is committed to improving the quality of life in nursing homes  to bring dignity to our elders latest years and demonstrating the reciprocal benefits of intergenerational connection. \I want to create a new paradigm in our society for what it means to age \"" Says founder  Julia Grace Vishnepolsky   \""I believe by preserving intergenerational connection and staying creatively engaged  whether through music  movement  or visual art   we maintain our vitality throughout the lifespan.\"" It has been shown that communities with the highest quality of life and longevity  also have a culture of honoring and connecting to their elders and common outlooks that lead to amazing quantity and quality of life. ALMA offers self-expression and connection to older adults through dance/movement and expressive arts  programming.  ALMA's group sessions each designed around a theme related to life and begin with movement and music activities where participants are encouraged to express how they feel. Then playful discussion is used to generate ideas for incorporation into art making. Often nature is incorporated into the sessions as nursing home residents have little to no access to the outdoors. ALMA frequently invites local musicians  movement practitioners and artists to guide segments of the programming.(Above)Special musical guest  Murray Hidary  giving a MindTravel piano concert during an ALMA visit to residents of Good Shepherd Health Care Center in Santa Monica  CA.Volunteers (Los Angeles locals and at risk youth) participate fully in the activities  although their role during art making is to assist older adults in the process and engage them in dialogue.For the last 10 months  ALMA has been running a pilot program  called PlantPals  that connects at-risk youth in addiction rehabilitation with elders isolated in long-term care (dementia and Alzheimers facilities) in a weekly 2 hour guided experience. Through this engaging and therapeutic program positive change emerges. Our pilot has touched approximately 150  elders in three communities  60 at-risk youth  100 volunteers  and 20 care staff. Our pre and post surveys demonstrate significant benefits on adolescents in addiction recovery. In addition to a decrease in anxiety and depression  adolescents report to have a decrease in cravings while at the program  improvement in self esteem and self image  noticing qualities of patience  leadership  and empathy in themselves.  FUNDINGWe operate in partnership with UCLArts & Healing initiative    as a 501c3 non profit organization. The nursing homes we serve do not yet have budgets to cover our program. The way ALMA has been able to serve up until now is through Julia's self funding  in kind donations from local businesses  and volunteerism. In order to ensure the continuation of the program  and thanks to the support of Murray Hidary  of MindTravel   Julia initiated a partnering project called  \""The Wave\""    a weekly silent disco experience held on Venice beach  with the intention of using dance as catalyst for social change.  While this weekly outdoor ecstatic dance event inspires individuals to get outdoors and dance in community as self care  it also is used as a platform to educate the hundreds of participants on the aging crisis and the positive impact of music  dance  and volunteerism on our elders. Part of the proceeds from The Wave go towards supporting ALMA. The same MindTravel headphones are used to engage the most marginalize in nursing homes  bringing music to bed bound residents that cannot join the group format. How ALMA came to be-(the short story):After the sudden loss of her father in 2010   Julia became a caretaker and health care proxy for both of her paternal grandparents.She eventually had to place both in nursing homes  and witnessed first hand  the low quality of care in the facility. Particularly  the lack of engaging activities  connection with outside community and nature. Given her background as an expressive arts therapist with a specialization in dance/movement therapy   she requested a position at her  grandfathers nursing home as a  dance/movement therapist  and began guiding weekly group sessions for the residents. This experience allowed her to notice an improvement in the social and emotional wellbeing of the residents  as well as in herself. Julia saw a need in creating a scalable program that could not only reach more elders but also involve outside community.   While in a leadership program  that required completing a community service project  Julia decided to take the task on  and establish a program that would bring volunteers to visit elders in local nursing homes and engage in through movement  music and the arts.  She reached out to local community to come as volunteers  and invited an expressive therapist colleague  Gina Simonelli  to join her as lead clinical therapist and help with curriculum development and facilitation.ALMA was born February 2018 and since has touched the lives of hundreds of elders and volunteers  bringing noticeable improvement to the emotional wellbeing of all involved.  ALMA Lead Expressive Arts therapist Gina Simonelli (left) & ALMA Founder  Julia Grace Vishnepolsky(right) at ALMA's launch day  February 4th  2018. In summary  ALMA has five overarching goals:1) To enhance the quality of life and reduce isolation of elders through direct music  movement and arts based programming.2)To create a culture change in attitudes towards the aging population through promoting intergenerational connection and volunteerism. 3)To demonstrate the benefits of the arts  intergenerational connection  and community service for at risk youth in addiction treatment.4)To Improve morale and decrease burnout of caretakers/staff through in-service workshops focused on self care. We believe that the staff are as much a part of the community as the residents and thus the wellbeing of every staff member is vital to the older adults ability to thrive.5) To conduct evidence based research supporting the above.  In order to keep this program and mission alive  ....WE NEED YOUR HELP!ALMA has been approached by UCLA who wants to conduct research on the benefits of our program combating ageism and helping adolescents in addiction recovery. However  they are requesting we expand the reach of our program to have a big enough sample to make the research statistically significant and publishable. Our hope is to use the results of this study to apply for and obtain larger grants  to expand our program nationwide. At this point we are self funded and will not be able to continue the program without funding. With your financial contribution we will be able to:I. Add additional days per week of programming and expand into more nursing homes.  II. Access more isolated elders and providing opportunity for more youth to join the program. III. Reach our goal of getting a big enough sample size for UCLA to conduct research study.IV.  Begin developing a scalable curriculum and training program to expand ALMA to nursing homes and addiction facilities nationwide.  This training program will not only ensure more elders and at risk youth are reached  but will also create job opportunities for individuals trained.How great is it know the elders in your life can receive such amazing community outreach and care? Or to know that by the time you are in your golden years  society now revels in the later years and regards you as a continuously participating member  rather than discard your value? Thank you in advanced for supporting ALMA and our mission  making this world more compassionate and connected. And remember...we are/will be them. We invite you to make a tax deductible donation in honor of an aging loved one in your life.  Whether alive or passed  family or an elder you admire or that has made an impact on you.Please write their name and additionally a quote or lesson from them that impacted you.All donations exceeding $111 will have their loved ones name written on our wall of wisdom  . and remember....

For the Love of Ericka: Beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/for-the-love-of-ericka-beat-cancer,1,SALISBURY,MD,When the beautiful Ericka (Tingle) Wright was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer  an entire community was devastated. Coupled with the news that the cancer spread to the lymph nodes in her arms  concerns and prayers increased for the activist who cares so much for her community. We all know Ericka as a motivator and advocate for those who sometimes can’t speak for or care for themselves. She has regularly participated in Breast Cancer Awareness initiatives  even unselfishly donating wigs and providing free makeovers to women suffering from the disease. Cancer is now attacking Ericka’s body. She suffered through Red Devil Chemotherapy treatments at Tunnel Cancer Center  where she endured extreme fatigue  hair loss  numb limbs  hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) burning  and other devastating reactions. Her treatments affected other bodily areas and weakened her physically  yet it hasn’t broken her spirit. This  along with a previously diagnosed lung condition has left Ericka unable to do the work that she loves  therefore  losing income from her full-time job.Having prayed for a clean bill of health after the grueling chemo treatment  Ericka is trying to find a homeopathic solution  so that she does not have to endure surgery and a brutal radiation regimen that will have irreversible life-alternating results. She has elected to take matters into her own hands  defy odds  and delete all traces of the cancer — forever.As the illness disrupts Ericka’s life  household expenses  medical expenses  and decreased income cause unnecessary stress  which adversely affects her health. One can only imagine the anxiety this brings to a cancer patient. Our goal is to alleviate the stress caused by her loss of income  so that she can focus on remission.Ericka has worked in the mental health field for over a decade and served as an advocate for various groups and individuals. From raising funds for a family devastated by a house fire to selflessly delivering coats to the less fortunate in freezing temperatures  she has dedicated her heart and given whatever the Lord called upon her to give to her community  her church  her clients  and her family. She is the most loving mother  daughter  sister  and friend  even through her immense struggles. Ericka exudes compassion  love  and strength. Even during the weekly social media update that she tries to provide supporters  she is led to motivate and inspire others. There is no one more deserving of your generosity. Please help us on our journey to heal Ericka so that she can continue to serve and inspires others. This is truly her purpose.Ericka loves you and asks that you share her gofundme link so that someone else who might want to help can have an opportunity.

Team Jake,https://www.gofundme.com/f43t8p-team-jake,6,SYRACUSE,NY,At the start of June  everything was normal. Jake was working everyday doing a job he loves  hanging out with his friends and family  and was really happy with the way his life was going. On Thursday June 8th  2018 everything changed. That was the day he suddenly began losing feeling in his legs. As the hours went by  his symptoms continued to worsen.  An MRI was done in the early morning of June 9  where a massive tumor was discovered wrapped around his spinal cord  rib cage  and lung  as well as several lesions in the same area. He was immediately prepped for surgery  as the doctors feared he would be paralyzed for the rest of his life if that tumor stayed in any longer. At 22 years old  a healthy young man began to experience his worst nightmare.The neuro surgeon was able to remove a 6-inch section of the tumor  relieving the pressure on his spinal cord.  From this point on  he was considered a paraplegic. After spending 6 days in the neuro-ICU  Jake was able to regain some feeling and movement in his legs  which was fantastic news.  However  his fight was just about to begin. The results from the biopsy of the tumor revealed that Jake had diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Prognosis was guarded due to the size of his tumor  and treatment would begin as soon as possible  as this form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was very aggressive.  Jake is undergoing a very strong and aggressive type of chemotherapy called R-CHOP. Due to the strength of this treatment  only 6 rounds are able to be given. After this  radiation is likely to be done as well. Jake will need to recover from his treatments and undergo extensive physical therapy in order to recover the use of his legs to enable him to return to work and carry on with his life.  Mounting medical bills  and his inability to work  have put an enormous financial strain on him.  Please join me in supporting my friend during this difficult time.,2330,15000,12,16,38,231,7
Anna Herrig Cancer Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/herrig-family-medical-fundraiser,1,PHOENIX,AZ,"Any of you who know my brother  know that it took some convincing to allow me to create this Go Fund me page. Dennis is usually the one helping others  but this time his daughter and their family are the ones who could use our support. When she was 13 my niece Anna was diagnosed with what we thought was Thyroid Cancer in May of 2016. We soon realized that Anna's cancer was much more complex. After her second surgery the Doctors found that it had metastasize to her lymph nodes and lungs. We also found out that she has a very rare double genetic mutation  MKRN1 - Braff Fusion  that makes her cancer much more aggressive and fast growing than most. Her cancer is very rare and very difficult to treat. She has endured 5 surgeries  multiple isolated radiation treatments  regular ultrasounds and pt scans and because of the rarity of her cancer they have had to meet with specialists at MD Anderson in Houston and currently traveling back and forth to City of Hope hospital in Los Angeles  since this team seems to know the most about her condition. She recently finished yet another 5 day isolated radiation treatment  where she must stay in her room alone and have no contact from anyone. We are waiting to see if perhaps this round has had any effect on the cancer and has slowed its growth. As of yet nothing has been successful in touching the cancer seen in her lungs and she can't endure any more surgeries to her neck at this point. She is having pain and numbness in her neck and we are uncertain of what the Doctors will suggest for her next step. Anna is a fighter and one of the strongest people I know. As a mom of a cancer survivor and her Aunt I ache for her. She is the type of person who needs to know the \plan\"" of action. She asks more questions and knows more about her condition than most. Unfortunately  her cancer is so rare that we have yet to find a Doctor who has a strong plan.  If all of this wasn't difficult enough  this July my brother Dennis had a Heart Attack and was hospitalized for some time. He had just started a new business and the stress of caring for Anna and his family  trying to take care of his own health and get a business off of the ground is simply too much for anyone to bear. Nancy continues to teach at Kiva Elementary and give a sense of normalcy and stability to Anna and her brother Jake and sister Ashley.  She is simply wonderful. I look back at my daughter's fight with cancer and know first hand how incredibly difficult it is. I can not imagine adding into that struggle a husband having a heart attack and Medical debt that would overwhelm anyone.Although they do have medical insurance through Nancy's job  it is minimal at best and some treatments are not covered at all. The medical bills are simply overwhelming. It has been over 2 years of medical bills  travel costs  hotel stays and time away from work and frankly there is no end in sight at this point. They need our help. If we could simply take some of the financial weight off of their shoulders so they could catch there breath it would mean so much to them. If you can hep financially  thank you. If you can not I so sincerely understand. I would ask that  if nothing else you share this with others. I know that together we could make a huge difference to the Herrig Family. Please Share.....""",26735,30000,18,89,196,711,6
"Need $4,000 in 2 Months for Top Surgery",https://www.gofundme.com/3dmk68-top-surgery,6,DURHAM,NC,"Friends Some of you may know me as that person with the tiny backpack  a cat dad (hey shug!)  a friend in community  a gym buddy  coworker  a total nerd who could talk for days about how terrible social media is for us and how important books are  an ex jock/basketball bb  a hippie nature boy you run into at turtle hole  or that person who always brings it back to what's happening right now astrologically.Some of you may not know me at all.Regardless  I'm reaching out to folks to ask for support in making this gender-affirming surgery possible for me.I've been wanting to have top surgery for years now  and I think before about a year and a half ago  I had just resigned to believing that it was too expensive  \unrealistic\""  and that it would never happen for me. Then  a dear friend was like: just make a consultation appointment and see how it goes!! I made an appointment with a surgeon  went to that appointment  and for the first time the surgery actually felt real  and possible.I have been saving for over a year now  and have a date set. I hope to have top surgery in March 2019 in North Carolina (where I call home). The total cost of my surgery is $8 900  which is uhm....STEEP. Originally  I tried to apply for independent loans  medical credit loans  and a raise in the limit on my credit card  thinking these would be the best and easiest options. I was thinking I could do it all on my own  and wouldn't have to ask anyone for help. After being denied for loans and a credit limit increase  I just started saving  and hoping I'd be able to save enough in  one year on my own.$8 900 is a lot of money though  and at this point I really do need some help. I have saved and sent $4 800 off to the practice that I am having the surgery with. Which puts me a little over halfway to what I need. The goal of the fundraiser is $4 000. It is my hope that if I continue working as much as I can in these next few months  and am able to raise $4 000 here  I should be in a place to not only have surgery on the date that I've set for myself  but also to be able to support myself in the 6+ weeks that I'll be taking off of work to recover. I have to have my final payment in full sent off to the practice by March 8th  2019  which gives me about two months. I'm having a lot of feelings about it  and have really been struggling to ask for help. But  I literally don't think I can do this without y'all. I love y'all. I love y'all so much. Thank you from the bottom of my gaaaay genderweird scorpio heart. Anything you can give is amazing and appreciated. If you can't give financially  but feel like you want to support me in other ways  please let me know! I am pretty nervous for the surgery and recovery and will probably need things like meals and rides and also just people saying sweet/affirming/supportive things to me and checking in!!""",2065,4000,19,52,58,191,4
Sharon&apos;s Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/sharon039s-recovery,0,MIRANDA,CA,"In 1981  when I was 20 years-old  my brother introduced me to Sharon. She lived in Salmon Creek  a small mountain region in Northern California.  Standing in her cozy living room  our eyes met across her dining room table  and she smiled. Thirty seconds later my brother left the room and she said \don't tell me  you're coming out of the closet!\"" How could she possibly know this secret  that nobody knew  and that I thought I'd done a great job of hiding?  I learned that she was called Cherie by close friends  and that she lived with her best friend and then partner  Shelley who was returning the following day. I spent six weeks with Cherie and Shelley and returned to visit them over and over again. My life was never the same. We were soulmates. My friendship with Cherie has been one of the great joys of my life for almost forty years. As you all know  Cherie is unique. She has hosted many of us in her home  taking care of our needs  cooking for us  entertaining us  making us meals and making us laugh. She has tortured us  driving us to distraction. But mostly she has listened to us  championed us  and loved us.   Over the past many years some of us (or loved ones we have brought to her) have had the privilege of experiencing her powerful and generous healing capacities. As some of you know  Sharon has recently been diagnosed with Renal Cancer. We are hopeful that it has been discovered early enough for a very good prognosis. She is awaiting surgery  after which we will know more about what next steps are. She has not yet received a date for surgery  and to expedite the process may have to have it in the Bay Area  which means she will live away from home for several weeks. It is a major operation  and recovery away from home will be hard for her  and will require extra help and caregiving. Enter the amazing Rose Andersen  Sharon's step-daughter  who after brilliantly graduating from the writing program at CalArts  got married this past August. On hearing Sharon's news  Rose  without hesitation  committed to staying with her and helping her through the process  living apart from her new husband Josh (who is in LA). For those that don’t know  where Sharon lives is remote which makes it difficult for Rose to work while caring for Sharon.  While Sharon is going through all the tests  the surgery and the recovery process  we can help support her emotionally and financially. It will be several months until Sharon or Rose can really begin generating income  and they need money to live on as well as to cover medical expenses that insurance will not cover.  It's a big goal. If you are able  please be generous.Please share this information with others whom we may not have reached.  On behalf of Sharon and Rose  I deeply thank you for your generosity.  With love and gratitude    Paul Browde""",9975,20000,26,50,47,85,7
Help Humberto get a transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/move-mountains-for-humberto,0,SANANTONIO,TX,Dear Family and Friends:  I am writing to let you know that a family man needs us to help him on his journey to healing and have an opportunity to live. Every day that passes by he has less chances to survive. Humberto Jimenez is a Husband and a Father of 3 children  he earns his living as a landscaper.  He received a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome  which is a type of blood cancer. I met Humberto 3 years ago when we needed help with our lawn.  He has always been  positive and a hard working individual.   This has not changed even after he was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago.   He is still a responsible father trying to provide for his family and working hard for his clients.   The only thing that is keeping him alive is a monthly chemotherapy session  and every other week blood transfusion that he has been  enduring for 2 years now.  The treatment is no longer working and the disease is still advancing  his only chance to survive is a bone marrow transplant  according to his Doctor.  They attempted to get help here  but their insurance only covers the chemotherapy treatment  and not the transplant which is very expensive and beyond their means.Solution: After so many months searching hospitals in Mexico and finding the donor that will have a 100% match    finally everything is ready  the hospital and the donor (his sister) who is 100% compatible!   This is an urgent situation since the chemotherapy sessions are no longer working.  Please find it in you to Pray  share and help.  If you could do all three or at least one of them  it will be greatly appreciated!  Even $5 helps to achieve the goal.   Prayers are powerful and share gives awareness to other people that can help.   Please be part of the people that help Humberto to have another opportunity at life.Note from his wife  Grace  Jimenez:In March 2016 our life took a 180% turn. Humberto was a healthy man  I would say very healthy  but we had to face a diagnosis that we never really imagined was possible.  As a wife I will do the most I can so that Humberto has the opportunity to continue to be here with us.Humberto always goes to his chemotherapy sessions  takes his medicines  but above all he continues to smile. Since he was diagnosed he has kept a positive attitude.  He enjoys playing with the kids. We never thought that something like this would ever happen to us. If by God's will  my husband has to go to his presence  we are sure that we both did everything possible to save his life  it won't be because we did not fight.It is a blessing to have him in my life  because he has peace and strength  he is a loving husband and father.  I have never heard him ask “why me?” He never questioned God’s love.   We will keep fighting the good fight and we know that there are many people who will support us sharing this page or donating.   Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!,1377,10000,10,14,14,120,7
Dibbs Gives,https://www.gofundme.com/dibbs-gives,7,CLEVELAND,OH,Hi all - thanks for taking a moment to read my story!I was diagnosed with Leukemia at age six  and is something that had a huge impact on my childhood. I celebrated entering remission after three long years  but will forever be grateful for the journey that has led me to where I am today! (A special thanks to my family and all those that supported me.)I will always remember the kindness of others - to help bring a smile to my face and joy to my life. I have been searching for the perfect way to give back! As many of you know  I also love to create and have since childhood. Many times it served as an outlet to pass the many hours in the hospital. I am taking donations to organize  assemble  and deliver arts/crafts packages and handmade greeting cards for children in the hospital over the holidays. I have a special spot in my heart for both Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital  and the Cleveland Clinic. I spent so much time at both places  that it was difficult for me to choose just one for donations. So  my goal is to donate as much as possible to both hospitals! I had no idea of the numbers when I began  and have since found out that in total  they expect to have 250 beds of their 300 filled in a couple short months. One package and handmade card would cost about $5.00  and my goal is to be able to provide one package for each child. Any bit helps! Please consider donating to help spread the holiday spirit! Thank you!,1500,1250,15,120,13,60,6

Cancer Victim,https://www.gofundme.com/9x6mxb-cancer-victim,1,CONVOY,OH,Someone very near and dear to my heart was recently diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer. A lot of the treatment has to be paid upfront and it's not cheap. I'm helping her with what I can but I don't have enough to help her as much as I would like. When I asked her about her health insurance she said she still had to pay 4000 before her insurance would cover it. She has to have chemo  radiation  and eventually surgery. I'm asking for 4000 to help us with the first round of medical bills because the end of the year is right around the corner and her deductible starts over. We will figure that out when we get there but for now I'm asking for help. Not all of her family has been made aware of the diagnosis so she will remain anonymous. Any size donation will help and if you can't donate please share so her story. Thank you!,885,4000,9,22,19,188,7

Clay has been in and out of the hospital for the past five months battling a serious antibiotic resistant bacterial infection. He was has been fighting this infection since late April of this year. It has been a tremendously difficult several months with countless trips to the hospital and repeated failed treatment plans  each very difficult to tolerate. Clay was finally able to see an infectious disease doctor in August  and he began an intensive intravenous antibiotic regimen. Due to the severity of the disease  the state of Oregon informed Clay that he was not legally allowed to work with the general public. Because of the legal restrictions placed on his ability to work  Clay has been unemployed for several months and has not had any income beyond a very small and short-term disability payment. We are asking for donations of any size  big or small  to help cover the cost of rent  utilities  food for him (and his sweet dog Aela)  medical bills  and the many other things that life has thrown his way.

Help Save Wobbie&#x2019;s Wiver,https://www.gofundme.com/liver-loot-for-rob,9,HAGERSTOWN,MD,As a lot of you know  and for those who don’t  my wonderful  loving  hardworking  husband Rob  has been battling severe abdominal pain for about 5 years now. In addition to being an awesome husband  I must add that he is an amazing father to the boys(furbabies included)! I have no idea what we would do without him in our lives  as he has completed our little family!Over the years  we have gone to see numerous doctors  including specialists at John’s Hopkins  in hopes of finding a cure for his pain. Unfortunately  he has not been able to get any definitive answers or solutions to his pain. When at Hopkins in Sept 2016  tests of all kinds were administered  only to tell him that there was a small mass on his liver  that was not cancerous and wasn’t anything to worry about. Within the past couple of months  he has experienced increasing abdominal pain  loss of weight  loss of appetite and fatigue. And more recently(9/29-9/30)  the symptoms became very extreme  keeping him from being able to work and provide for his family. This past Monday(10/1/18)  I took off work to take him to the Waynesboro Hospital ER  where they ran some tests and found that he had two large masses on his liver and a blood clot in the portal vein  that is supposed to feed blood to his liver.  The results found  landed him in a hospital bed for the night  so that they could monitor him more closely and start him on blood thinning medicine to help the blood clot and to prevent any further clots from forming. Late afternoon  Tuesday(10/2/18)  the hospital staff felt that because Rob’s vital signs remained stable for the duration of his stay  that he was able to be released with a prescription to continuing his blood thinning. After asking many questions  we agreed and I was able to bring him back home. Wednesday(10/3/18)  we were able to get him an appointment to see him primary care doctor in Gaithersburg. After sharing the results found at the hospital with them  they immediately felt a since of urgency in getting him an appointment to see a GI doctor. A few hours later  we met with him and he also felt that the results found were of high concern and suggested that we go to Hopkins ER as soon as possible  as they are equipped with the technology to better assess and help Rob. Thursday(10/4/18)  we spent the day at the John’s Hopkins ER. While there  vitals were taken and monitored and an in depth ultrasound was performed. The results of the test are being forwarded to both  his primary care provider and the oncologist in Hershey  who we will consult with next Wednesday. Tomorrow  Rob and I will be traveling to Hershey  PA  to have an MRI done. As you can see  with everything going on  Rob nor myself have worked at all this week and we already have upcoming appointments scheduled for next week. Due to the severity of Rob’s current health condition  and the need to travel to be seen and cared for  by qualified doctors  we forsee many more days off work and many more distant travels  creating extra fuel and food costs  not to mention the struggle to pay our regular monthly bills and upcoming plethra of doctor bills. As a loving and supportive wife  I will be by his side  as we conquer all of this. I currently have several paid leave days remaining  however  there are few and forsee them depleting quickly.  Rob  on the other hand  has used all of his paid days  due to pains and complications related to his current condition. All donations  whether monetarily or through prayer and/or positive thoughts  are greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for everything! ❤️,9565,20000,2,48,145,8000,7
Single Mother With Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/mother-battling-leukemia-aml,0,GIBSONVILLE,NC,On October 2  2018  April Michael admitted herself to Cone Emergency in Greensboro because she was sick for the past 2 weeks. The doctors took blood tests and found her white blood cell count was extremely high. After further testing  she was given the news she has Leukemia. She was then brought to Wake Forest Baptist Health to start treatment. She has started chemotherapy on October 4th.She is being diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). There are different types of AML  it is unclear to us which one she has at this point. The stage it's at and how quickly they were able to catch it  is also unclear at this point. Generally  it's a quick growing form of leukemia (acute)  which starts from cells that are supposed to grow into different types of blood cells. Most often  AML starts in early forms of white blood cells. According to healthline.com  most people with AML receive chemotherapy treatments. These are medicines that kill rapidly dividing cells  such as cancer cells. In patients younger than 60  roughly 70 to 80 percent will go into remission after “induction” (first round) of chemo. The five-year overall survival rate for AML is 26 percent. This means that of the thousands of people living with AML  an estimated 26 percent are still living five years after their diagnosis. For lower risk AML groups  the five-year-survival-rate is 65 percent. April is a strong woman  with very few risk factors. We are praying she has a speedy recovery and the cancer will go into remission.April has 3 children ages 18  15  and 10. Her youngest  Coleman  is in elementary school. Natalie  15  is a high school student at North East High School and Kierrah  18  graduated high school this past year and just started working at Walmart. She is the sole provider for them. She has been working as a delivery drive for Jason's Deli in Greensboro for many years. Her boyfriend  Daniel  has been with her in the hospital since she was admitted. He lives with April and her children. Her children are in the care of Aprils mother  Paige. The family typically lives paycheck to paycheck. They're currently renting a house  where the five of them stay together.We want to start raising funds to help them pay for things like food  utilities  rent  and whatever the kids may need. Since April and Daniel don't have larger incomes  they will have a hard time maintaining their bills with neither of them working. April is a wonderful mother and she shouldn't have to worry about losing her children's home and them having enough food to eat  while she's going through these tragic health problems. The last thing a family should worry about is money when they're experiencing such a hard health risk and her family doesn't want her to worry about those things. The starting amount is just an estimate to how much they could use to pay their bills for at least a couple months (while she goes through treatments and recovery)  as well as  provide food for the kids  and gas for helping them travel back and forth to the hospital. I  personally  will have no access to the money. Their bank account will be linked to all funds. We started the page on their behalf to try to show support and take away some of the burden. They are good  hardworking people  who don't deserve this in the slightest. No one ever expects to get this news from their loved one.The page will be updated as we find out more.,525,4000,2,13,5,222,7

Help TracyAnn Keep Her Dignity,https://www.gofundme.com/Help-Tracy-keep-her-dignity,9,SAINTALBANS,VT,I have been lucky enough to get to know TracyAnn for a little while now. She is a selfless  compassionate  caring and hardworking mother of two children who has been separated for more than a couple years from her husband and is mom and dad 99% of the time. She has an extremely high work ethic and works as a paraprofessional at the elementary/middle school where her kids go to school. She has been there for almost 20 years now. She also has a photography business and teaches skating lessons outside of her main job. She is busier than most people could ever stand and is constantly running her children to soccer games and gymnastics along with all the chores that come with taking care of a house and two children. Despite her hectic days she keeps a positive attitude and is up most of the night cleaning  doing laundry and preparing for the next day. She is an exemplary human being  someone most people couldn’t strive to be. Even under all the stress and pain she keeps on keeping on.  Due to her circumstances and childhood injuries she needs well over $4000 in dental work done as soon as humanly possible. The insurance she has will only cover a very small portion of what she needs done. Time is of the essence as one of her front teeth is decaying underneath one of three teeth that have been fixed numerous times with many issues. If she cannot get them fixed soon the infection may/will cause serious health issues. Being so close to her brain is the major concern due to infection. Please help Tracy so she can keep being the amazing mother she is and help relieve her pain and stress. EVERY DOLLAR will help,255,4500,13,6,9,51,6

raise money for a service dog and medical bills.,https://www.gofundme.com/nhv9vm-service-dog,0,BIGLAKE,MN,Hi my name is Kaley.  I'm 25 years old and I have a long life struggles ahead of me with health disabilities and trying to get another service dog to help me out with daily activities and help with my medical disabilities.    In September 2012 I got bucked off a horse and I broke my pelvis on the right side and on the left side. My right side healed but my left side did not heal so I had to have surgery to have pins put in my left hip to my pelvis to hold it together. I use to love going for long walks in the woods or going for a long bike ride. I no longer can do these things because of my pins. I get bersidis in my hip which is a pocket that fills up with  fluid that goes in between my hip and my pelvis and tries to pull my pins out of my pelvis.   In August 2013 I was having trouble breathing. I could get out of bed and walk to the bathroom and I would be out of breath. Going up stairs I would have to stop in the middle of the stairs to sit down and try to catch my breath. I went to the doctor and after they did some tests EKG  and having a heart monitor on for 5 days the doctors diagnosed me with tachycardia. My heart rate ranges from 105-180. With having tachycardia my heart is always elevating which makes me feel really tired.    In may 2015 I married the love of my life. He would do anything for me. He has been by my side through all of this since the day I met him on 2011.     In June 2015 I started to get brusies all over I went to the doctor and my platelets were at 20 000 which is really low. So I started to go to the Minnesota oncology in coon rapids I would go twice a week and the doctors would take 15 viles of blood everytime to try and figure out what was going on. First the doctors scared us by telling me that I might have luekimea. After a couple of months thinking I might have luekimea my doctor had told me that they didnt want to diagnose me with luekimea because you have to have all the symptoms and I was just missing 2 of the symptoms which were red or white blood cells being elevated. Mine are not they are in healthy range. My hair started falling out really bad i would wake up with new brusies everywhere  I could take a warm shower and come out with new brusies that would have hematomas in them. So after going to the oncology for 2 years they finally diagnosed me with (ITP) idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpa. Which in an autoimmune disease. ITP is not cureable so I will have it for the rest of my life. My immune system is attacking my platelets which is your clotting material in your blood. I started getting little red blood spots all over some that don't go away and some that go away in a couple weeks. I do not like to wear shorts or t- shirts now because from where I have had internal bleeding and brusies they have now started to change the color of my skin. My body is not healing the same as it use to. If I get a little cut they turn into scars and take weeks and weeks to heal. When my platelets are below 35 000 or if I have internal bleeding I have to go on steroids. They give me predison which is one of the stronger steroids being on it for long periods of time it starts to shut your organs down. I have been on this steroid multiple times each time being one month at a time. Starting at a high dose to stop the bleeding or to get my platelets up. The first couple weeks of being on the steroids my platelets go up into 150 000-250 000 which is normal about the 3 week my platelets start to drop and the day after I stop them my platelets go back to the 50 000s.    In November 2017 I started to get migraines everyday in the last year I have had maybe 5 days without a migraine. I wake up with one and I go to bed with one. Most of the time my migraines make me dizzy  light headed  and make my vision go black. I was sent to a neurologist to see if they could help me. After sitting with the neurologist he told me that there is nothing he could do for me and that he is not going to make another appt with me because he can not help me because I can't take any medications with my ITP. So here I am trying to live my life to the fullest and enjoying it with my husband  my service dog  family  and freinds. With my medical disabilities its hard to work not knowing how I'm going to feel in the morning or what the next day is going to bring me.  My service dog buddy is getting old and will need to retire in a couple of years. Buddy has made my everyday life a little better. From helping me get up when my bersidis is bad and im stiff  to picking things up that I have dropped  to alerting me when my heart beat starts to elevate  to alerting me when my platelets are dangerous low  and when I have internal bleeding to let me know when I need to go to the emergency room  he gets me water and my medication. With my migraines I will lay down and he will wrap his body around my head to put a little pressure on my head. He always knows when there is something not right.  With my medical disabilities it make it hard to be able to work not knowing how I'm going to feel that day or what the day is going to bring. But I try my best to do what I can and make it to work. Somedays I may not be able to make it in other days I can make it only a couple hours  and others I can make it the full 8 hours. My husband has been amazing throughout everything that we have gone through and he is so supportive. From going to every doctor visit  er visit  caring me when I can't walk anymore  to laying and trying to make me feel good when I have really bad migraines. I don't know why this has to be like this I just wish I could be healthy.

Get these veteran&#x2019;s home  liveable!,https://www.gofundme.com/bring-the-fiefs-home-back-to-life,0,SALEM,OR,Brad  Jessica  and their kids have been through more in the past 5 years than most people do in their entire life  yet they still end the day with smiles on their faces and love in their hearts. Not only have these people given their time to serve their country; but in a time of pain  they put their own selves aside and welcomed a child into their home. For that  I ask you to read this story. If you can spare ANY donation or time of your day to share this story and help this amazing family back on their feet  it would be greatly appreciated. Brad and Jessica met in December of 2011 while in the Army attending a single soldiers retreat put on by their Chaplain. During dinner with friends  Jessica was struggling with cracking her crab legs but refused Brad’s help until he told her “Swallow your damn pride and let me help you!”. They have been inseparable ever since  getting married by their Chaplain on March 16th  2012. In 2013 they decided that they both would deploy once again. After getting back from their deployment they started looking into having a child and were told they could not conceive naturally. They were urged to look into conceiving via IVF. So  $10 000 later and a few months down the road; Jessica found out she was pregnant on Thanksgiving of 2013. She was considered a high risk pregnancy and ended up hospitalized at 20 weeks for nearly three months. Then  at almost 32 weeks  Jessica gave birth to their first son  Tanner on June 11th  2014. 21 hours later on June 12th  2014  Tanner gained his wings and went to heaven. During their healing  Brad and Jessica decided to move to Texas at the end of 2014. Jessica was honorably discharged by the Army in the beginning of 2015  and Brad at the beginning of 2016.  They ended up in the Houston area  where Brad had landed a job. Shortly after getting settled  they received a call from Child Protective Services because they had heard the Fiefs would be interested in adopting.  Without any doubt  they said yes  and Taylor began living with them in December 2016. Now... Surprise! Jessica found out she was pregnant on Mother’s Day 2017. Throughout that summer they were watching the Atlantic very closely  knowing it was a very active hurricane season and they were close to the water. Jessica heard about Harvey not long after it was named and she knew this was the one that would affect them (Mind you this is still over a week in a half before landfall). They prepared as much as possible  packing as much into their RV as they could. The day it made landfall (August 25th  2017) they got everything they could and left their home and the rest of their belongings behind  not knowing what they would come back to. They evacuated to the Texas/Oklahoma border at Lake Texoma. This was the closest place to home they could find that didn't show rain in the forecast. They stayed there for about a week  watching their home be flooded from their ring doorbell camera until their power was out... After the storm finally moved on and the water receded at their home  they went back... the only thing was  this “home” was hardly the home they had left behind. The house was a complete disaster with their possessions and debris littered everywhere. The smell was so horrific they will never forget it. But  they couldn’t just stand there  so Brad and PREGNANT Jessica  along with a few volunteers  gutted their entire house and hauled all their possessions to the curb as trash. After things started getting back to “normal” (while living in their RV in the driveway) they didn’t give up on Taylor and officially adopted their daughter on November 20th  2017! Shortly after this was finalized  Jessica gave birth to their son Elijah on January 15th  2018. Unfortunately  the story doesn’t end here. Ever since Hurricane Harvey  they have been battling with their insurance companies  trying get enough money for the repairs  only to be met with small sums of money that do not amount to the damages. They have tried meeting with lawyers to look at options  only to be turned away. That’s not all... it was then discovered that the RV that Brad  Jessica  and their two children have been living in  had mold in it which was causing their kids to constantly get sick. Knowing they would not be back in their home anytime soon  they had to go out and get a different RV  clean all of their belongings throughly and move into the RV without mold.Here we are in current day  out of money  a lot of work to do and trying to raise a family  living in the driveway of the home you hoped to raise them in.

Desperate Veteran needs surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpBenGetHelp,7,TYLER,TX,OUR STORY:Yes  this is our little crew many years ago as we were about to embark upon the biggest adventure of our lives. God called us to International Missions and that took us to Africa.  Both Ben & Julie had their early years there and all of us can say that we have been changed for the better. We are still in Missions though without our grown children.  Living abroad enhanced our life in the most amazing ways  and both of our children have a God given ability to relate almost immediately to all cultures.  We consider it a gift received on the journey.BEN'S STORY:Our son has suffered for many years since serving  His country in the military . The status of his injuries has him at 70% disabled.  His injuries began causing  considerable pain after he returned from Iraq.   Never one to slow down  he began working 2 weeks after returning   and continued to try to make progress and be fruitful for years; however  as time passed he became less and less able to sit or stand for any length of time without suffering severely in his lower and upper back.  The back injuries he received have been documented by MRI's but to date  the medical care that he should be receiving has eluded him.  The severely injured discs keep him in severe pain  and until now he has not been able to continue with his studies or work.  Our son will use these funds to acquire a back specialist who will then set a course of action to help bring relief and healing.YOUR GIFT TO BEN WILL HELP HIM REGAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE AND ABILITY TO WORK AGAIN OR PURSUE A DEGREE IN COLLEGE.TEETH ISSUES:  Ben began experiencing severe pain in his teeth and gums several years ago . The pain at times has almost been unbearable. This issue has become one that many other soldiers have experienced since serving in Iraq.   To make matters worse  his teeth began to crumble  and for a young man who always took great care of his body this was startling and very discouraging.  Nothing has given him relief from the internal pain he suffers in his gums.  Ben received  help from a foundation that specifically helps warriors with their dental issues.  He was able to see  a specialist who tried to save his teeth. Up to this point  the work done has only helped stop the crumbling of the teeth for some period of time.  No more funds are available to move forward and get the help the  he needs.  A detailed  analysis of what is going on and what can be done to help  save his teeth is what is needful at this point.  With these funds  our hope is to acquire a specialist who can investigate what needs to be done to bring relief and healing.  Implants may be needed  and this type of surgery is very costly.￼Ben receiving care from a great local dentist who has tried to help with his case.  The dentist told Ben that in all of his years of practice he had never seen anything like this.  THANKING GOD FOR A DENTIST WHO HAS TRIED TO HELP!From Iraq with love on Mother's Day.,4070,50000,15,8,23,111,4

Alex Palmer Medical Support Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/alex-palmer-medical-support-fund,0,GRANDPRAIRIE,TX,I cannot say that my story is unique to anyone  but I can for myself.  My husband and I met and fell in love 20 years ago this year  and I have seen him do some extraordinary things.  Not to say that he is a saint  because we all have flaws.  But Alex’s selflessness has made me look at him with more love and admiration  and he has made me look at myself differently when it comes to sacrifice.  I have seen Alex give a homeless man the coat off his back  pay for groceries for a random stranger in line that was a few dollars short  pay for gas for a family that was stranded  and give money to a people that I knew in my heart was lying. Alex would always say to me; “Regardless what they actually do with what I give them  it isn’t our place to judge them.  They asked for help  and I am obligated to help any way I can.  And we cannot let the wrongs other people do to us affect the rights we do for others.”Alex has been a faithful union brother of CWA Local 6215 and CWA Local 6171 for more than 15 years combined. Alex has served as union steward for the FSC1 in Irving  TX for Local 6171 for several years.  He is a diligent worker in church where he is the photographer and videographer  giving much of himself to ensure the happiness and comfort of others.  But all of this came to a halt this past May.My husband  Alex  went into the hospital  Texas Health Presbyterian Flower Mound  on May 2  2018  for a planned 2-day surgery.  He needed to have repaired  a cervical fusion that was originally performed in April 2016. After the 2nd surgery  he looked at me and told me that he could not feel or move his left arm or leg  and that his whole left side was numb.  Partial mobility was restored after a few days  but his left leg would not support his weight  hyper-sensitivity down his left arm  and he had poor function of internal organs. Part of his daily routine was to have physical therapy worked with him to get me into the shower.  They made a few attempts to get him to and into the shower  but the pain in his neck  back  arms and legs was so excruciating  he would black out by the time he reached the shower stall.  Dr. John McElroy  spine surgeon  advised that the nursing team had not been giving Alex the prescribed pain medication so that I could tolerate the pain  so he made it a requirement to give the pain meds regardless of pain level.  After taking the pain medication  later that day he was able to take 18 steps and was finally able to take that shower.On May 9th  2018  Alex was transferred to Medical City Arlington (Texas) Rehab to receive physical and occupational therapy. He was getting stronger and gaining better mobility  but on the 20th of May  2018  at approximately 11:15 PM  Alex suffered severe neck and back spasms.  Along with electric shocks from nerves firing  he was completely paralyzed from the neck down.  This was a pain like no other.  Alex said  “It feels like a large snake wrapping and squeezing my body.”  He became very light headed  short of breath and then he blacked out.  I thought that I had lost my husband. That night  Alex was care flighted back to Texas Health Presby. Flower Mound for further testing  but his they were not equipped to run all test  so he was then care flighted to Texas Health Presby. Dallas.  There  Dr. Jerry Marlin  neurosurgeon  found that his spinal cord damaged  he had nerve damage  and a blood clot that was squeezing on my spinal cord causing his paralysis.  Dr. Marlin was able to find the source of the blood clot  a cut artery  and fix it  but he was not out of the woods yet.  Dr. Marlin advised that the nerves and spinal cord would take up to a year and a half to heal  and that this would be a long and painful journey  and that the bone graph that was placed to promote the fusion had broken up and had to be removed.My husband and I spent several more weeks there in Presby. Dallas  and was finally released to go home on June 11th.Since then  he has had some good days and some bad  but Alex never lost his faith or determination to walk on his own and use his hands. I have seen my husband lift hundreds of pounds  and it pains me to see him struggle with 5.  He still sees the positive in his situation  and he still makes me laugh in the face of adversity  but I believe that he does this to keep me from worrying too much about him. I watch him struggle to get up out of bed and sit up to eat.  I see his pain when he tries to sleep  and the exhaustion in his face because of the muscle spasms that makes him shake and keeps him awake at night. Alex is currently getting home health care from Aviator Home Health who sends a physical therapist out 2 to 3 days per week.  When I watch him work out  it seems as if he is getting so much better  but then I see him struggling to walk or stand up straight.  Although home health is very convenient for us  he may be transitioning over to outpatient therapy within the next month or so for a more aggressive therapy session.And even though he may not tell me or intentionally show it  I know that he has more worry now that his job has cut his pay by 50%.  He just keep smiling and telling me that everything is going to be alright.  He has been the sole bread winner since I was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2013  and now our savings is running out.  This year  his medical insurance changed to where we now have deductibles to meet plus a 10% co-insurance.  His hospital stay  testing  therapy  labs  and consults has amounted to $730 602.67 based on what we received from the insurance company.  Thankfully we do not have to pay all of that  but we still have approximately $6000 left to pay in deductibles plus $77 000 in CareFlight fees that BCBS has denied the claim for.  We did file an appeal  but no telling which way the insurance company will go.Alex will get better and back on his feet  but he has about another year or so of recovery.  So  I am asking for help from whomever that can so that we can pay on medical bills  continued physical and occupational therapy  as well as ensure that we do not suffer any major financial burdens by not being able to afford to live in our home.   We have about another month or 2 before our savings is exhausted  along with hardship withdrawals out of our 401K.  No amount is too small  and any amount would be greatly appreciated.  In advanced…. Thank You.Lena Palmer,1925,30000,17,6,36,143,7

Support Sammy Survive Brain Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/support-sammy-survive-brain-cancer,0,RussellVale,NSW,"My journey with brain cancer has recently thrown us another challenge which resulted in a second brain surgery. Whilst surgery went as well as it could have  I recovered well and I am extremely lucky to come out of it with no major impairments which is what we were concerned about. I have however lost peripheral vision in my left eye which was hard to get used to and work through in the early weeks but I have adjusted and don’t notice it as much. We received the pathology results and unfortunately it has changed for the worst and we are now dealing with a grade 4 Glioblastoma. The average survival time is 12-18 months - only 25% of glioblastoma patients survive more than one year  and only 5% of patients survive more than five years. As you could imagine its been an emotional and tough few months and while  statistics are against me  it hasn’t changed my determination to find a way to be the exception.Throughout this journey so much help has been offered and has been the only way we have been able to get through these past 3.5 years and  we are so incredibly grateful. Knowing I am here asking for help is hard but the truth is we can’t do this alone and need your help again. I want to get rid of \Terrence\"" the Tumour for good so we can get on with life  perhaps start a family of our own and make plans for the future for us as a couple but for hopefully our children too. My surgeon wants me to start chemo & radiation right away and then get into local trials. With brain cancer chemo and radiation isn’t a permanent solution it’s a short term solution. What I am after is a long term treatment  something that is going to give me more than the year I am promised  something that is going to give me hope and quality of life  not something that is just buying a bit of time but resulting in the tumour growing back anyway. We have been looking into treatments in Mexico and Germany offering immunotherapy that is having incredible results  which boost your own immune system to fight the cancer itself  hopefully buy me more time and one day this tumour will be stable and my body show no evidence of active cancer so we can move on with life as well as possible.The downside to this is the huge cost that it involves and this is just a rough estimate without travel costs or currency conversions that will most likely exceed predictions  as even after the initial intense regime to get the tumour stable  patients generally continue to go back for years to come.  German doctors have told me they have patients with brain cancer and my specific tumour still living 8 years after this treatment  this is so promising and I am so excited by this possibility. We are in direct contact with people with brain cancer who are now stable after this type of treatment and doing incredibly well with multiple stable scans. The main treatment being the Dendrictic cell vaccine  where they take some of my blood and culture a vaccine specific to me which boosts my own Immune system to eliminate/stabilise the remaining tumour. This vaccine is administered 4 times initially spread out 4-6 weeks apart   so the travel to and from the clinic  the loss of complete income  the bills we have to still pay at home whilst doing this is what we are up against and unfortunately we can’t do it on our own. I will continue to be completely transparent and share everything I implement along the way  as well as with such a grim prognosis which I am not settling for we will be doing all we can to tick things of our bucket list and continue to live our life to the fullest while I can.Seeing and experiencing new things as we can afford to do so  as I visualise myself living a long and healed life but I can’t ignore the statistics of this beast and need to act now so we can fulfil our life dreams and grow old together. Thankyou from the bottom of our hearts for all your love and support as my journey continues 3.5 years on and I still believe I can and will beat this! As always  I got this Love Sammy & AJ xx""",46751,80000,25,58,504,1000,7
Hope 4 Harper,https://www.gofundme.com/yjbnx6-hope-4-harper,7,Caversham,WA,Hope 4 Harper14 months ago  Michael and I welcomed our beautiful girl into this world under very traumatic circumstances. Unfortuneatly on the night of the 3rd of August 2017 I experienced a placenta abruption. A medical rarity that is life threatening to the mother and baby. During an emergency cesarean  Harper died 3 times due to complete detachment of the placenta  which caused a loss of blood and oxygen to her vitals.Due to Harper’s birth  Harper has received a formal diagnoses of Severe Spastic Dystonic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy  Microcephaly and Epilepsy. Which means Harper’s ability to do everyday tasks such as speak  walk and crawl are all non existent in our precious girls life. Watching Harper everyday wake up with her massive smile and conquer each day with such strength is truly a blessing. It is incredible to watch despite the pain of her twitching  arching body that is controlling her tone and undermining her possibility to develop and reach milestones in unimaginable ways. Imagine picking up a fork and once you grip the handle your whole body tenses up so tight that it completely locks up every single muscle  your toes are pointed so far that they resemble the perfect ballerina point and the grip of your clenched fists could rip the skin off your palms. It is gut wrenching to watch Harper endure this every single day without her brain letting her control the ability to stop this from occurring. Our Hope 4 Harper is to provide her the ability to move comfortably  to enhance every possibility to achieve some or all milestones. This hope could come true from the available medical treatments.  Stem Cell Transplant - Has the ability to restore the damaged brain. In patients with brain injuries or neurological disorders  the stem cells are able to bridge gaps and form newer neurons that repair the damage to the brain  some result in miraculous improvements with just one treatment. This can improve the cognitive skills and function of Harper’s body.Spinal Dorsal Rhizotomy - A neurosurgeon cuts the damaged nerves carrying sensory information from spastic limbs where they enter from the spinal cord. Eliminating the tightness and stiffening throughout her body. A parent said this surgery was like gifting their child with new legs! There is amazing research and treatments developing for Cerebral Palsy  however  it comes at an expense and travel since they are not yet available in Australia. Our hope is to raise enough money for these treatments to occur so Harper’s furture isn’t defined by a wheelchair. Thank you for reading our story  if it touched you in the slightest way please Please PLEASE share! We would be forever geateful for any publicity or donations  big or small  in the hope of reaching our future goals for our Courageous Harper. If you are unable to donate  please share!

Draper Family Support Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/67obr0w,5,NORMAN,OK,On September 28  Piper Draper was on a bus with a group of her fifth grade classmates headed to a weeklong educational camp in San Antonio Texas. They were to study marine life and have an opportunity to have a trip on an ocean going research vessel. Piper  who lives in Oklahoma  had only seen the ocean once and barely remembered it. She had pleaded to be allowed to go on the school trip as a “break from her normal life”. Piper’s father Scott had recently suffered a major brain injury in an accident at work that had a devastating effect on the family  both emotionally and financially. Piper was struggling. So her mom let her go. In Lampasas  Texas the bus hit a curve and began to hydroplane. The driver lost control and the bus rolled over three times before coming to a stop against a fence. Glass and blood were everywhere. Children were crying and trying to contact their parents who were six hours away in Oklahoma. Piper was taken to a military hospital at Ft. Hood where she was diagnosed with a broken shoulder  injured knee ligaments  and whiplash. She was fortunate to be able to be discharged the next day  but will need significant follow up medical care. She does not remember the accident. But she is afraid of being in the car and very worried about her friends and teachers.This GoFundMe is to help defray the costs to the Drapers for medical care and counseling  as well as lost income. Scott has been unable to work since his accident  and because of the workers compensation laws on Oklahoma  he is making significantly less than he was. Leslie  who is self employed  has had to take significant time away from her work as well  as Scott’s migraines often leave him unable to drive and he is required to go to many doctor and therapy appointments. Piper too is going to have a slew of appointments relating to the wreck. And finally  Leslie has MS and a slew of other auto immune diseases which require treatment and appointments. She is having to miss some of her own appointments to prioritize her family’s appointments  and suffers daily from exhaustion and pain. This is a family in crisis. They are loathe to ask for help. In fact  they very much prefer to help others. But they have been hit by one heck of a storm. It’s a struggle to keep the lights on and food in the refrigerator. Please consider helping them financially or emotionally  even if it’s just a kind word. Thank you for your time.,4615,25000,8,18,68,702,7
Martha Bleah Emergency Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/martha-bleah-emergency-fund,7,Mississauga,ON,The last day Martha Bleah saw her husband Paul alive was when he was separated from her and hurled into a military truck. It was 1990 and Liberia was one year into a brutal civil war. It would be several more years and an estimated 250 000 deaths before the fighting ended. Journalists such as Paul lives were at risk due to the nature of their work; for Paul more specifically  his tribal roots made him a high target – that is why Martha and Paul had decided to flee their home. With their three children they walked on foot for days when a white military vehicle stopped them. Paul was taken to an unknown location in Liberia where he and others were brutally murdered by a killing squad of the Liberian armed forces.Now a widow  Martha gathered her three children – Paulina  Lohkoah  and Dorwoan - and continued her desperate journey to flee the fighting. Despite her overwhelming loss  she shielded the children and fled to the neighboring Ivory Coast – 395 kms (245 miles) away. There at the Danané refugee camp  Martha nurtured and comforted her kids and created a new life for them. In the camp Martha became a force for good  supporting and encouraging other widows. She provided arriving refugees food  clothing and shelter. She became known as “Aunty Martha” to hundreds who experienced her generosity and directed others to her for help. She had a philosophy of working with her hands and not asking for handouts because of her deep trust in God.Martha and her family lived eight years in the Danané refugee camp. And then – on November 13  1998 – things changed for the better. Martha and her children moved out of the refugee camp and across the world to Moose Jaw  in the Province of Saskatchewan in Canada. There they started a new life in an area very different – and MUCH colder! - from the warm tropical coast of West Africa. She began working and slowly became independent. A year later Martha and the family moved to Toronto where she bought a home and worked two low-wage jobs as a Personal Support Worker (PSW)  caring for the elderly to make ends meet. Through all the moves  Martha has been followed by the many people whose lives she touched along the way -eager to hear of her new life in Canada.Then in the summer of 2018  Martha received shocking news from her doctors. Her years of working as a PSW had severely injured her back. She would have to stop working due to an inoperable condition she developed in her spine  leading to intermittent paralysis and severe pain in her back and legs. Those of us who have benefited from Martha’s compassion and care are now motivated to return the kindness she so generously bestowed upon us. We are deeply moved to come alongside her and support her during her time of need. We are reaching out to all the family  friends and well-wishers that this amazing woman has touched over the years and those reading this inspiring story to join us in raising enough funds to help Martha pay her medical bills and expenses for one year  as she focuses on her recovery. With no work  she needs help urgently! Martha remains one of those strong women whose eyes have seen death and the ills of war in Africa but whose resolve  resilience and orientation towards kindness and forgiveness is indelible in the hearts of many she’s impacted. Despite all that Martha has endured  she is optimistic about her condition. She still hopes to impact her community and her native Liberia where she wants to someday return to encourage and share her infectious love with other women and girls that have walked in her shoes. You! We can help her realize this vision today.,2840,40000,31,7,36,49,7
Rich Kwiatkowski&#x2019;s Health Care Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/rich-kwiatkowskis-health-care-fund,0,CHEBOYGAN,MI,3 years ago Doctors told Rich he may never return to painting again  let alone walk for at least a year after a freak accident damaged his leg.  He in returned showed the doctors after 7 months that he could walk and returned to painting.  Nothing stopped Rich once he returned to work.  There were good days and bad days. Days where his leg looked as though it was ready to explode  but when he had a job there was no stopping him. 3 years later after the fight of never giving up no matter how bad his leg would get  he just wasn’t feeling well. After finally going to the doctors he was told he has cancer.   Testicular cancer which is in his lymph nodes next to his kidney and in his lungs. Today  Thursday 10/4/18  Rich will be heading into surgery so they can remove the testicle and will put a stent in to open his kidney hoping for better function.  He starts chemo on the 22nd for a week and then has 3 weeks off.  They are thinking he may have to have 4 rounds at this time.  He will be laid up for at least 6 months.   Rich will not be able to show the Doctors this time. He will need all our prayers and support. He is a strong man and he’s got this.  If you know anything about Rich he hates asking for help.  He would much rather have everything pile up and then bust his but when he heals. The expense of traveling back and forth and the bills piling up and Christmas right around the corner  and being out of work for the minimum of 6 months is only going to create more stress  something that doesn’t get along well with cancer. Thank you for everything you are doing and for all the prayers. We greatly appreciate it. I will make sure to update tomorrow on his progress as I hear.,1910,7000,10,27,29,219,7

Brother and sister beating cancer together,https://www.gofundme.com/brother-and-sister-battling-cancer,1,RIVERBANK,CA,Hi. I am 17 years old and I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in October 2017  right after my mom was diagnosed with cancer. We were just getting back to a normal routine when my 12 year old brother was diagnosed with 2 cancerous brain tumors called Astrocytoma in August of 2018. He was having headaches  so our doctor did an MRI. A few weeks later  a brain biopsy confirmed the terrible news. We are so devastated with this news. Childhood cancer is supposed to be rare and yet my brother and I are now both warriors. We went for our check ups last week and the doctors felt a lump in my neck. They took me in to surgery to remove the node. Unfortunately my cancer has returned. My mom is a single mom who has been limited to working very part time due to all of our appointments and hospital stays. With both of us diagnosed  my mom makes even more trips. He sees a neuro ophthalmologist and a neuro oncologist. He has frequent MRI's and other tests  on top of my visits. There are so many expenses that we have. Gas to get to our appointments  tolls  groceries  everyday expenses. We are in great need of help to raise enough money to help with the costs of traveling  food and bills. Unfortunately bills don't stop when you have a cancer diagnosis. There are so many extra expenses that many people don't realize come with a cancer diagnosis. Our family has been through so much. We never thought this would happen to us  especially twice. No mom should have to watch 2 of her children fight this horrible monster. Please consider donating to us. No amount is too small. We appreciate each and every one of you for helping  sharing this post and praying. We know God listens.,5311,7500,4,71,92,2000,7

Kick S4 Colorectal Cancer in theBum,https://www.gofundme.com/vbb5c-stage-4-colorectal-cancer,0,Ipswich,QLD,"UPDATE #1:    Since writing this Greg has now been advised that his chemotherapy is not working  the cancers in his lungs from his Colorectal Cancer has grown significantly and that chemotherapy will stop.  Yes  and the cancer will take it's own course now.My dearest Greg was diagnosed with Metastic (stage 4) Colorectal cancer almost 4 1/2 years ago and if we knew back then what we know today he would have been diagnosed sooner.At the time we didn’t know what the symptoms were and he was sick on and off for 12 months yet travelling throughout Australia doing labour exhaustive shutdowns and coming home tired.  I would let him sleep  not knowing what was lying within.  Being male he didn’t complain  he didn’t talk too much about what he was feeling  just that he was having some issues and he had visited doctors and nothing was wrong.   He visited GP’s in different states on his shifts off and was given blood tests and they kept saying “NO  don’t have cancer it’s colitis  you need to change your diet” and “NO sign of cancer it’s chrones disease”.  I pleaded with him to go and see our local hospital and have every test he could.  He finally got a referral for a colonoscopy which took some 6 weeks to obtain as we didn’t have private health cover  we were okay with that as he wasn’t sick we were happy to wait.  The day finally arrived for the colonoscopy we were confident they would not find anything.  That was not to be the case.  I remember being told to go and do something as he would be a few hours  so as any woman does  I went shopping  (window shopping of course).I had been in the shopping centre for only 30 mins and I get a call asking me to return to the hospital as soon as possible  it was at that moment I knew something was up.  I arrived back at the hospital and ushered into a private room where Greg  was sitting with his specialist on the other side of the desk.  His head in his hands  he looked at me with a look of fear and I had never seen this look on his face in the then 28 years together  my heart sunk but my head somehow knew what the outcome was going to be  however never to the extent I got \It's Colorectal Cancer\"".He had a tumour 10cm x 7cm at the very base of his rectal area and had to be removed immediately along with his bowel and other areas.  The specialist said that had general practitioners done what is referred to as a “finger test” then the tumour he had would have been found immediately and before it had even got to the size it was.  Of course all the questions run through your head how  why  blood tests never revealed anything and so on as any normal human beings.  Greg was shattered which is what hurt me the most to see him like that and know I could not take that type of agony away from him  as much as I would like to have.His journey was going to be greater than we ever imagined.  We were booked in immediately to all the necessary centres for treatments doing duel chemo and radium and the maximums  many reading this will either have been through or have seen their loved one’s go through these and it is exhausting for them and what it does to their bodies.   It was during this time that scans revealed that there were suspect markings on his liver and lesions on his lungs and that is was Stage 4.  We had to have that clarified as to what that was  and then the word “terminal” was dropped and again the world was rocked being told he only had around 12 months to live with \""Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer\"".  Everything that could be done for him was going to be done through the health system.  Trying to support him emotionally and mentally was my biggest challenge now especially having never been around anyone who had cancer at that time.  To make it worse the company I was working for at the early stages of all of this made me redundant and all the redundancy money for those months was all used up  before I was able to find some work all whilst Greg was in and out of hospital having tests  treatments and his biggest and most major operation was to remove his liver which was extremely stressful as this is a big operation for anyone let alone having two operations prior and he was already weak from them. We re-organised our lives  we spent numerous hours talking about what he wanted and how he wanted to handle things.  We changed our lifestyle although we ate and lived healthy it still wasn’t enough we had to go further.  He insisted that he would continue to work until he could no longer or he felt it was time to stop.  We moved closer to the hospital treating Greg to make sure he did not need to travel hundreds of kilometres for his 3 weekly treatment cycles permanently  and as our son was attending a school closer to the hospital we made the decision to move the family from our home and be together for Greg. Greg never stopped helping others and running around for them even whilst he was undergoing his chemo treatments and major operations  he still travelled distances to repair things and dropped whatever he could to help others.  He has always been like that  he’s one of those guys who would “give the shirt off his back”  he’s kind and generous of his time  knowledge and hard to believe this happens to a man like my Greg.  His generous and giving nature has had us both at logger heads sometimes as I wanted him to think and look after himself firstly.  Call it selfish on my part however I needed to be selfish for him at this point  but down deep I know it seems to be why he has survived the many timelines he has been given. When he gets any opportunity to talk to other men about what he has and what he's been through he tells them  but most of all he persuades them to go and get checked and not be so \""bloody proud\""  he educates them  and through these conversations a few of his mates have had colonoscopies and had things removed which gone unattended would have become a much different scenario.  He has never complained about what he is going through at any time.Greg has had terrible and irreparable nerve damage to his feet and hands and muscle surrounding his heart has been weakened from various chemo reactions which were abnormal  at one stage being admitted to coronary care for a little over one week with heart attack symptoms from one of the drugs.  His dignity has been stolen from him regarding other areas of his body as well.He has been undergoing chemo ever since he was diagnosed (around 70+ hits now)  we have been blessed with him being with us for 4 1/2 years however it is now putting us under some financial stress.  We have used up his small amount of superannuation  we have used up our equity in the home and not able to renovate our home back 100km away  as he is not well enough to finish it.  He’s continuing at the present time with chemo  but Greg feels it’s time to give up his chemo as he wants to go home and not be in palliative care in a hospital when the time comes.  I applied for carer allowance and it was rejected twice as they consider he is not incapacitated enough to need it.  So we gave up.  I tried to plead my case  but you read it right his terminal cancer is not considered for any carer allowance.We survive on one full-time wage and the bit that Greg can bring in because of his stubborn streak to continue keeping himself occupied.  However  Greg is now finding it harder to breath and get around like he used to it’s now time we need to make the move back home  but don’t have the money to finish renovations and he doesn’t have the energy either  I wanted to go on House Rules but he would never withstand it with his condition.  With money donated I would secretly have the house finished for him and surprise him so we can move back  take him on holidays away to a few places he has often mentioned in those “before I go” conversations  pre-pay for a small funeral for him and let him finally relax and enjoy what time he does have left with dignity and peace.Thank you for your precious time I do hope you can help me reach my goal for Greg.Catherine""",12050,67000,15,18,46,219,7

Mark&apos;s fight to beat Lymphoma,https://www.gofundme.com/d4xc8w-lymphoma,0,GRANDTERRACE,CA,On October 3rd  we unfortunately received bad news. The PET scan and bone marrow biopsy results came back that the cancer is still there (but is responding to treatment) and Mark will have to start chemotherapy again  this time with a new chemo regime and a referral for a bone marrow transplant. Mark will be off of work for over a year this go around. We are scared but hopeful.  We became new parents 2 weeks ago to a beautiful baby boy. I am off work recovering and working to finish my Respiratory Therapy program and receive my license hopefully in the next month.  We've had to use our entire savings  and have had family members  help us. I thought we'd be ok and that Mark would be fine. But we are truly needing help now  and it is really humbling to have to set up a go fund me page  but we need help to make it through the next year of chemo and treatment. Anything would help us! Donations would be used towards our medical bills  rent  utilities  groceries  and baby needs. Please read our story below...Earlier this year my husband Mark was diagnosed with stage 4 Lymphoma. What we thought were flu like symptoms turned out to be cancer. It completely flipped our world upside down. We had just found out we were expecting our first baby when we got the news. So we had to put our excitement on hold and gear up for the fight of our lifes. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed that mark had two forms of lymphoma. And 70% of his bone marrow had been affected. The doctor advised we start chemo ASAP. So the following Monday (April 3  2018) Mark was started on a chemo regime called R-CHOP.  It was an aggressive form of chemotherapy that he would get every 3 weeks for a total of 6 chemo sessions and then be re-evaluated to see if it worked. Each cycle he received this chemo via an IV and into his brain and spinal column via a lumbar puncture which took a toll with each subsequent treatment.  We were scared  sad  angry  and frustrated. But with nothing to do but fight  pray  and trust our medical team  that’s what we did. We said our prayers and gave it to GOD! Some days were easier than others. And some days it felt like the world was caving in on us. We spent many days and nights at the hospital for chemo treatments  lumbar puncture appointments  lab tests  surgery  and baby appointments  it felt like we lived there. On July 26th  Mark received what we thought was his last chemotherapy session. We were excited to finally start getting our life back on track. After being off of work for 6 months for this intense treatment  Mark finally went back to work and boy was he happy!!  And on September 16  2018 we welcomed our beautiful baby boy into the world.  :),8626,25000,14,35,87,436,6
"Colon Surgery, therapy and expenses",https://www.gofundme.com/2kkxgd-colon-surgery,6,CHARLESTON,SC,Dear Friends and Family Chris has been sick since mid September  in which she learned that she had a hole in her colon.  This hole is called an obstetric fistula  which means that her bowel movements don't end up in the right place  they go to her genitals instead.  This has caused my mother an extreme amount of pain and suffering  and has also racked up numerous hospital visits.  She is scheduled for surgery December 11th  in which they will remove 6 inches of her colon.  The reason she has not had surgery yet is because the particular part of her colon they plan to remove was infected  and they must wait to make sure all risk is minimized. In early October  I noticed that my mother started to have trouble communicating with me.  She had trouble thinking of certain words  and lost the ability to use her right arm.  This led us back to the doctor  in which we were recommended to see a neurologists.   The neurologists was able to pinpoint the problem with an MRI  in which we learned that she had a stroke in her frontal lobe. This explains why she is having trouble communicating and using her right arm.  To remedy this  she is receiving physical  occupational  and speech therapy until she no longer needs it and returns to normal.Both of these issues has left my mother incapable of working.  She's been out of work since the middle of September  and won't return till around the end of December.   We've just filed for short term disability  but that will not be nearly enough to cover her normal expenses.   She also has to worry about covering her bills from the ER  from all therapy she will be receiving  and the looming colon surgery in December.I implore anyone reading this  to please consider donating any amount of money to my mother.  It could only be $5 to $10 but it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance Logan Anderson,200,2000,6,10,6,83,7

Car Accident Ruined Family&#x2019;s Life,https://www.gofundme.com/helpthedeckerfamily,0,PORTROYAL,SC,Hurricane Florence set in motion a mandatory evacuation in South Carolina  and evacuation we didn’t take lightly and left is soon as we heard about it in the best interest of our child  evacuated immediately spending all the money we had to make sure that she would be safe. We took our four-year-old as far north as we could go 12 hours after we left the governor of South Carolina canceled evacuation order... at this point we could never afford to go home and risk putting the safety of our four-year-old in jeopardy nor could we risk the chance of going home and the hurricane changing course again prompting another mandatory evacuation as we spent all of our money to evacuate the first time. My name is Alex Decker  husband to Cassie Decker  Father to Alyna Decker  I’m a USMC Veteran  and I do my best to be a good person. If I’m being honest it has not been an easy past three years getting out of the military  doing everything I could to take care my family struggling at first to find employment  then struggling to make ends meet. I found out firsthand that this idea that veterans are loved by society is not true when I got out it took me six months to find any employer that would be willing to hire me  in six months of searching I sold everything I owned to keep food on the table and a roof over my daughters head.And to anyone who knows me you know that I would do anything I can to help my others  and you also know that I NEVER ASK for help.... this very hard for me to do.Once the hurricane had passed we drove back down  we made it back from New York safely and we thought everything was back to normal. The next day my daughter went back to school my wife went back to work  and I went back to work. We’ve been down to one vehicle for well over a month because my jeep broke down it’s been sitting at the shop where my wife works well they try to figure out what’s wrong with it thank God we had another vehicle to get us through that time and help us evacuate to protect our 4 year old. Then Tuesday came around  took my daughter to school  then my wife took me to work  I worked 10 hour days every day  so my wife needed the car every day to make sure that my daughter could be picked up from school after she got out of work at 5:30pm  then to come and pick me up at 7:00pm every day wile we Dealt with only having one vehicle .That morning  after dropping off my daughter to school and driving the 30 minutes to my work we were sitting at a red light at a four way intersection we were the first ones in line and my work was directly across the street  the light turns green everyone around us has come to a stop we start moving forward barely at 5 miles an hour we just get our nose into the intersection when our life went spinning out of control.The witnesses who saw the crash said “the light turned red and I had more than 100 yards to come to a stop came to a stop and I see this person flying up past us in my mirror we thought she was going to run the red light and she did and that’s when she hit you“ Young person to meet us had more than enough time to stop but wasn’t paying attention  her exact statement to the police was that she was sorry she didn’t See us she was just doing her normal morning routine  she told that police officer and several others that she was too busy dancing in her car listening to music  she hit us at 70 miles an hour in a 55 mile an hour zone after blowing through a red light the black box from her car recorded that she never even once touched her brakes.... she t-boned us and sent us into a spin  we spun 2 full times before the vehicle came to a stop  every single airbag deployed and the front end of our car was all but ripped off. My wife and I were taken to the hospital from the accident we received initial medical care my wife who is driving took the brunt of the blast and had the majority of the injuries between us. But our bad luck didn’t just end there  no.... Now having no transportation we had a coworker of mine pick us up in the hospital and bring us to my work well we tried to figure out a plan to move forward. Borrowed a car from one of my coworkers to drive over to the lawyers try to figure out a game plan. At this point not only are we injured scared and having our lives completely flipped upside down  we just don’t know what to do.After spending time at the lawyers and bringing the car back to my coworker I had to find somebody to pick my daughter up from school because we had no vehicle I called everyone I knew after every favor I could  manage to get my daughter picked up and my wife manage to find us a ride home one of her coworkers drove more than an hour to come pick us up and bring us home while our neighbor who was the mother of our daughters friend fortunately was able to pick up my daughter from school. NOW HERE IS WHERE IT STARTS GETTING TOUGH Now without any transportation with the limited source of money we had to take care of my family  I had to find a way to get my wife back to the hospital for more times before she was better something that’s really hard to do when you don’t live close to the hospital and you also don’t have transportation  have to find a way to take care of my daughter get her to and from school  Have to get groceries and take care of my family  have to take care of my injuries and everyone else’s. My wife was out of work for a week she tried going back to work but got taken to the hospital again  once she was able and healed enough to go back to work she did fortunately she had people she could carpool with me on the other hand 30 miles from my work… I was let go from my job and now have no income.

Ann Seymour: Finding Home Again,https://www.gofundme.com/AnnSeymourWilmingtonNC,2,WILMINGTON,NC,So many people have done so much to help. Many more have asked how they can help. So here I am  against every lifelong instinct I have: Asking for the help people want to give. My precious home is  probably lost to me. The impact of massive trees on that little 1941 hot bunk house was more than it could take. It tried so hard. I have been able to save precious family items  and a few pieces of wooden or rod iron furniture. But everything else is lost. Almost all of my clothing  including my shoes and boots; any “winter wear” including coats and jackets.All of my bedding  including both mattresses/box springs  most bedroom furniture  my desk  all upholstered chairs  sofa  many lamps  curtains  blinds  pillows  cushions  rugs  and appliances  (vacuum  Dirt Devil  mixer  toaster oven) and virtually all other kitchen items. I lost all my tools  too. My TV and computer. Maus’s bed  toys  clippers  and so forth. I lost my portfolio and years of samples of my work - irreplaceable  but I wanted to give you the complete picture of my heartbreak.The adjustor told me to plan on needing housing for 9 or 10 months. He might as well have said “for 20 years.”  On top of all the other costs I’m facing  paying rent for either 9 months or 20 years feels like the same level of impossible. Insurance may help with some of this. I'm awaiting more info on that  but for now  this is where I am.Heroic efforts by the smartest  hardest-working friends old and new prevented my losing everything  but it's a ton of stuff to replace. I have no idea what  if anything  my insurance will cover  as I’m not sure if tree removal and demolition are deducted from the dwelling limit  and that would cut substantially into an already tight rebuild fund (if they give me the max allowed by the policy). I am eternally grateful  but scared. Living without a safety net  no home  untethered.  After having to start over just 12 years ago  I know the challenges ahead. My little 1 000 square foot cottage was my joy  refuge and focus. As a single woman  it is a struggle to maintain a home. You live by your wits  but it's so worth it. And that's where I will put my energy and any and all resources: finding my sense of home once again.Thank you  dear ones  for any help you can provide. I can’t tell you how much it means. It’s unquantifiable  but also everything.,7415,7500,22,99,91,231,7

Kendra Lane - Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/kendra-lane-medical-expenses,1,LAKELAND,FL,"PLEASE HELP - ANY AMOUNT WILL HELP!  This is my precious sister in law  that desperately needs help.  She is absolutely amazing...a loving and kind single mother  daughter and friend.    She is brave and courageous  and has fought a long hard battle.  She endures with strength  grace and dignity.  She has taught us all so  much during these past few years just by her example of not giving up.  Her sweet spirit is full of life and her smile is contagious.  She is my hero...  Please please  help her.  This is her story:The Big \C\""-my journeyAnyone who knows me  knows how I don't like to ask for anything. Several people know my situation but many do not. I don't advertise or speak much about it  unless asked  because I always thought I can deal with it myself but the time has come that I realized that I cannot do this on my own that I need love and support from many  My journey began March 2015 when I was diagnosed with a rare  very aggressive  cancer called Mucosal Melanoma. My tumor was removed and I opted not to do any treatment at that time. Sure enough about 21 months January 2017 later it metastasize to my liver. Being this is such a rare cancer and not many options for me  I decided to move forward with radiation and Immunotherapy. Radiation did kill the liver tumor but it metastasized yet again to my lymph nodes within a few months  while I was still doing Immunotherapy. I was so frustrated because I was feeling pretty good about it but obviously it wasn't working. My doctor told me about a clinical trial where they removed one of my tumors  they extract the good cells and multiply them by billions and re-inject them back into my system so all the good cells can fight the bad cell. This trial has saved many people and they are living cancer free  so I decided to do it. Well  I had several complication doing it. I was allergic to my own cells  I went into anaphylactic shock. I really thought my life was over at that moment. Needless to say  that treatment didn't work and I was now bald  and yet again it metastasized to more lymph nodes. As of last week  I have 4 more new tumors all in my liver. I have one that is so big that you can see it coming out of my stomach and that is one that is on my lymph node. At this point  I am limited on options because there is not much history or knowledge in the Western World of medicine regarding my kind of cancer. I have seen several doctors and one out of state  and they all are pushing this cocktail of two Immunotherapies that causes major side effects. I have already been in and out of the hospital 15 times  almost died from one treatment  and none of them have worked or even slowed down the progression of this horrible disease  so I have opted not to do any treatment. This is a huge and scary decision for anyone but I feel at peace with it and my doctors think I have lost my mind. I have decide that I will continue to approach my disease with holistic alternatives. Insurance does not cover any of this..it is all out of pocket and it is pretty expensive to do but I feel this is where I am being guided. It costs me about $400 minimum a week...not including eating right  paying bills  car  rent  a 16 year daughters needs with no income since I haven't been able to work in 3 years due to the disease.  There is a holistic Doctor in Clearwater that has helped cure a friend of cancer.  If he can help me  the cost would be a minimum of $30 000.  Presently  I am doing a machine called the Bemer. I would like to get one for my house because I need to do it 2 times a day but not able to right now because the machine costs $6500. I am doing high doses of Vitamin C with glutathione  Essiac tea  Medical Marijuana and a few supplements because that is all I was able to afford. However  I am now running out of money to continue and to add more holistic stuff that has shown beneficial to cancer patients. I am leaving this in Gods hands and trusting that he will heal me and will help to guide me to where and what I need to do to heal. I will not give up and I will prove the doctors wrong and for anyone who is reading this  who may be in this situation....Do Not give up  follow your heart  You Got this and God will not give up on you and so neither should you!!!!""",5150,35000,16,15,43,192,7
Cancer assistance,https://www.gofundme.com/sr2mu-cancer-assistance,1,MADISON,AL,I was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer in November 2017 and have been having chemotherapy treatments every 2 weeks. My wife and I are both retired  so we rely on our Social Security and what we have from my 401k from work  but still we are limited income. My insurance has an out of pocket cap on payments of $5000/year and I met that in April. I also have several prescriptions that are costly as well and still having to pay that. For example  I have one that is priced at about $1000 for about a 1 month supply and that doesn't fall under the cap. I have been doing much better and am currently on a maintenance plan  but the doctor indicates that this will continue indefinitely. That means that I will need to pay the $5000 again next year along with the prescriptions and possibly for years afterwards.In addition to this  we were named as legal guardians to our 14 year old grandson until his parents can get clean and are able to take him back  but that may take a year or more. This is an additional expense that we had not planned on for our retirement years.My wife is also having major asthma issues and has been approved for a shot that should help. Unfortunately  this shot costs $1500 per month and we were told that it would be forever.I really appreciate any support that we can get from the Go Fund Me service.Thank you Steve,5790,10000,19,58,25,86,7
"Tough Cookie, victory over death!",https://www.gofundme.com/tough-cookie-victory-over-death,6,ConcordWest,NSW,It happened on 30th Sep 2018  the Long weekends. Cookie was being so happy and was walking along the road with my friend in Macquarie Park in Windsor but suddenly an unleashed pit bull dog ran to him and bited him so hard and do not let him go. Luckily  lots of people came to help and two strangers Mark & Philip helped to save Cookie from the other dog’s mouth and sent him to the hospital. However  Cookie suffered a lot and losing lots of blood when arriving in hospital and now the whole lung 80-85% are bruise and injured，and the most thing is now only can use the machine to help him for breathing. Left jaw is waiting for surgery and the left front leg body muscle is waiting for surgery once he would be stable to do it himself. Now  he is staying in Animal Referral hospital and the daily cost treatment for him is more than $4000/day. And current bill is up to $12000 already  I believe he can make it and Doctor said if he can make it  he will come back to a normal life. But it is really hard for this huge amount to spend daily. Please bless him and if you could donate some money  I would be really appreciated for every single dollar you try to help and save him. Cookie loves you all!!,2990,30000,20,10,49,145,7
Marias Medical needs,https://www.gofundme.com/marias-medical-needs,6,WARRENTON,MO,My daughter Maria was born with several health related issues. All in all she is a strong  happy baby but she has been thrown some unfair curveballs. She has a grade 3 Vesicoureteral reflux that will require extensive imaging and possible surgery to fix in a few short months as she is finally big enough to undergo it. However the matter that is most pressing right now is a strange growth she has on her right ear that has grown in size since birth  and is needing to be removed via surgery in a few short weeks. My husband has medical insurance for her  but it just kicked in a month ago and we are liable for the deductible for her surgery as well as specialty co-pays for all of her hospital visits before then. We are asking for any help you can give  to help our family stay above water for the health of our beautiful daughter  and her older brother. Thank you.,1101,10212,49,11,18,3,7

Nada and Gayane&#x2019;s Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/nada-and-gayanes-recovery,8,SOUTHRIVER,NJ,Hello Everyone this page is created for our best friend Nada and our friend Gayane. Earlier this morning we were informed that there was a terrible accident in St. Kitts where they attend Medical School (MUA)  they were both in their 5th semester expecting to take final exams in December. There was a gas-line explosion while both of them were inside their apartment. Other students pulled them out and drove them to the nearest hospital on the island. Nada was air-lifted to a hospital in the states shortly there after  however  Gayane remained on the island while her family was searching for a hospital that would accept and treat her. The accident caused very painful 2nd & 3rd degree burns spreading across 80-90% of their bodies. They are currently in critical condition  however we as her close friends and family feel as though a page to raise money for a speedy recovery would be helpful. We’re not asking for much from anyone but every and any ￼penny counts  and we thank you all. Her family and closest friends are all by Nada and her friend Gayane's side praying for her recovery. Please let us keep our girls in our prayers in our hearts  they are FIGHTERS and they'll come back stronger than ever. This is a very sad and hard time for all of us  and we appreciate all the love  support  donations  and kind words of encouragement and positivity. Thank you. 100% of donations will be directly given to Ahmed Khalil  Nada's brother.,10802,10000,26,108,206,373,7

Jackson Beck&apos;s Fight,https://www.gofundme.com/jackson-beck039s-fight,9,PITTSBURGH,PA,Jackson’s StoryDuring the last week of September Jackson came home with a persistent cough Monday the 24th. Mom took him to the pediatrician and was sent to Children's South for a chest X-ray as he had been wheezing Tuesday morning. We started nebulizer treatments at home and daycare the next few days. By Thursday  September 27 daycare called and said he was running a low grade fever of 100.8 and to come pick him up. Over the next 3 hours Jackson had been vomiting but then was able to scarf down a bowl of mac n cheese later in the evening. Friday  September 28 Jackson got sick once more and would fall with his first couple steps. We thought he just wanted to be carried and soon realized something was wrong. We made him another appointment to see his pediatrician that day and they sent us to Children's Hospital assuming it was Transient Synovitis (hip inflammation brought on by an upper respiratory infection) affecting his left leg. On Saturday  September 29 he began losing the use of his right leg. Most devastatingly  by Sunday  September 30 he could only sit up with assistance. After many conversations with the pediatrician and going to the ER once during this time  he went back to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and was admitted via the ER the morning of Sunday  September 30  leaning towards Guillian-Barre Syndrome because of the ascending nature of peripheral weakness.To date there have been several tests  including a lumbar puncture and MRI. Once we had the MRI completed Sunday we learned there were 2 other cases showing the same symptoms with similar imaging that had been admitted the night before. What are the chances of that? These doctors are now thinking this was caused by a virus that initiates as a common cold with possible flu-like symptoms. The particular strain they tested for was D-68 came back negative twice. However they still believe the virus is in the same enterovirus family that affects the central nervous system and presents with polio-like symptoms and calling it AFM or Acute Flaccid Myelitis. The odds of being infected with something like this are quite slim. Because there have been so few cases over the last several years the CDC is involved. Jackson's blood samples  cultures  etc. were sent out Monday  October 1st to the CDC to hone in on what caused this. Jackson has been given IVIG antibodies and Prozac to hopefully stop the progression of this virus  and ultimately treating Jackson with supportive care  breathing and feeding tubes along with lots of meds to help keep him comfy. Jackson's team of doctors and nursing staff have been wonderful. We know Jackson is in the best hands.We appreciate the outpour of support and prayers from our family and friends through this difficult time. Everyone has truly been amazing from helping us care for Charlotte and our pets at home to providing us meals  gifts cards  visiting  and mowing our lawn! We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We are truly blessed.Bobby and Nicole,43702,60000,28,73,622,1000,7
Mom Needs Help,https://www.gofundme.com/7qwd2a-mom-needs-help,0,SANTAANA,CA,Hi all I am sorry I need to do this but  I am looking for any help I can get. We are desperate!As many of you may know my mom has had lots of financial difficulties. She has been doing her best at living off approx. $8-900 a month from SS. Her kids  including Andy  have been doing everything we can to keep her afloat.She has now been hit with a huge issue:She has lived many years with just 8 lower teeth and a denture on the upper. She is now going to be losing those 8 teeth. She has no ridge to hold a denture on the lower. She has massive bone loss and her only option is implants and an over denture on the lower.As you all know  dentistry is VERY expensive. We are right now working on getting many estimates to see where we can get the best price. The first estimate I got was from my dentist and even with discounts it still came to over $12 000. Terry is now working on the option of possibly taking her down to Mexico to see what the cost would be there. She is obviously not able to afford much. Her kids are planning on doing everything we can but still very difficult to come up with that much money. We as a family decided to reach out and see if there is anyone out there that can help us fund this for her. Anything would help!!! Please feel free to share this with anyone else that I might have missed.Thank you! Love The Reid and Schwinge Kids,1500,4000,24,38,18,40,7

Honoring Rose Duncan,https://www.gofundme.com/honoring-rose-duncan,1,LANCASTER,WI,In honor of what would be Rose's 56th birthday  and after the love and support we received last year through this campaign  we would like to again raise money to create care packages for patients going through cancer treatments at the Upland Hills Specialty clinic/SSM Dean Specialty clinic.Rose spent many days here and was always greeted with a smile and kindness. Going through cancer treatments is never easy; it is a painful and exhausting process that impacts a person’s physical and mental health. We are asking that on Rose’s Birthday  you take the time to donate a gift of money to honor her memory.  The money will be used to create care packages that would include things such as: lotion  blankets  activity books  pillows  and anything that we have found to make the process even a little more bearable.  Cancer sucks and no one should ever feel like they are fighting alone. There are so many families  charities  and causes to donate to right now. Adults and children are fighting for their lives and trying to survive during these tough times. We ask that if you are unable to donate to do something kind for someone instead.  Rose would have done anything for her family  friends  or even a stranger.  If you would like to donate supplies for the care packages in lieu of money please contact me at: a.n.duncan2012@gmail.com Thank you so much for your gift in honor of the wife  mother  and friend who inspired us to always fight our hardest and stay positive through it all.,690,600,11,115,20,141,7
Please Help Jackon Beck,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-jackon-beck,7,PITTSBURGH,PA,Jackson Beck is only 2 years old and an unexpected virus with polio-like symptoms has cost him the use of his legs and arms  which the doctors are calling AFM or Acute Flaccid Myelitis. He's been in the hospital since Sunday  September 30 and there's no telling when he'll be released. Jackson's parents  Nicole and Bobby  are being as supportive and positive as they can to keep Jackson in good spirits. Before this happened Jackson was a happy  active  bouncing boy who loves running around  swimming  climbing  playing at the park  and doting over his baby sister  Charlotte. Jackson laying in a hospital bed not knowing when he'll be able to do those things again is heartbreaking  and is something parents should never have to go through. With round the clock care in the PICU and extensive medical testing  the cost is going to be immense. If like me  you want nothing more than to help but feel helpless  please consider contributing to manage Jackson's medical expenses. In addition giving Nicole  Bobby and Charlotte the peace of mind they are not alone. Nicole and I have been friends since high school and Jackson is like a nephew to me. She would never ask this herself so I am asking for her. Thank you for reading their story.,3790,5000,30,76,37,50,7
2nd brain surgery for Kyle,https://www.gofundme.com/2nd-brain-surgery-for-kyle,0,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,First  I want to say thank you for taking the time to read this story. My name is Ashley Wojcik and I am starting this campaign for the two strongest people I know  my sister Amanda Mendoza and my nephew Kyle.     Kyle is very athletic young man who loves being outside  hanging out with his friends and he is the most compassionate 17-year-old I know. He is a junior at Whiteland High School  a running back on the football team and an awesome pitcher in baseball. He loves to fish  if he could he would fish from morning till dusk. He says it is a stress reliever.      My sister is a full-time single mother of three beautiful children ages 17  8 and 6. She is loyal and the best mother and sister anyone could ask for. In addition  Amanda is working to accomplish her dream of becoming a RN. She has a little over a year to go in her nursing program but anticipates having to put this on hold to be with Kyle. She knows Kyle will need her more than anything before  during and after the surgery.     Amanda and Kyle’s nightmare began about four years ago on Labor Day weekend. Kyle and a friend were having fun driving an ATV; they had an accident and flipped it. My sister rushed Kyle to the emergency department where they did a CT scan to rule out a concussion. When scan came back  Kyle was diagnosed with a 3 cm heavily calcified brain tumor (choroid plexus papilloma) in his left temporal lobe that extended into the left temporal stem. Within three weeks Kyle had surgery at Riley’s Children Hospital. The surgery went well  and Kyle was able to return home within a week.      For the next 5-6 months Kyle had to deal with side effects from the surgery: amnesia  the worst headaches imaginable and he was very sensitive to light and sound. Amanda had to take unpaid leave from work to take care of Kyle for these 5-6 months; as a result  she ended up behind on many bills.      They continued visiting the hospital for follow-up MRIs and doctor appointments; the doctors assured them things looked fine. The side effects started to go away with just the occasional headache. He started to play football again; his life seemed to be going back to normal.     However  during the last couple of months  Amanda has noticed Kyle's amnesia has returned and his headaches have started occurring daily. These headaches are much worse than a typical headache. The only way for Kyle to manage the pain is to seclude himself in a dark room with the door shut and a blanket over his head. Nothing helps him besides time and rest.      Concerned  Amanda took Kyle to see his neurosurgeon and their worst nightmare began again. They were informed that the tumor is still there and growing.     Over the last month  Kyle has returned to the hospital multiple times for tests. He had an EEG  which indicated he has an extremely high risk of having seizures. Doctors told him there is a high chance that he is already having petit mal seizures without realizing it.      Kyle still has three different MRI’s scheduled: functional fMRI  MRA  and MRV. These tests help the neurosurgeon map out the functional areas of his brain as well as visualize blood vessels and veins before the surgery. Additionally  they want him to undergo a neuropsychological test before and after the surgery. This will help the doctors determine the impact the surgery will have on Kyle  after the surgery.      Currently  many worries weigh heavily on Amanda and Kyle. We don’t know how the surgery will impact Kyle's motor skills. There is a high chance he will need extensive rehabilitation to relearn how to walk  talk or perform basic everyday functions. There is concern Kyle could have further memory loss or end up with a totally different personality. Kyle is extremely disappointed that his current high risk of seizures keeps him from being able to get a driver’s license.     The experience of having to go through brain surgery is something no family should have to go through once  let alone twice. During this traumatic time Amanda needs to focus on the well-being of Kyle; he needs his mom more than anything right now. They mean everything to each other.      Kyle can't help but worry about his mom having to drop everything to care for him. He’s been asking Amanda about how they will be able to make it since she will have to stop working again while he’s recovering after the surgery as well as before the surgery because of all the tests. My sister told him to stop worrying about all the adult money stuff because she has everything taking care of.      I know these words are not true  but she doesn’t want Kyle to stress more than he already is. So  let’s make these words come true. With your help maybe  we can take a quarter of my sister’s stress away with helping her with any medical bills  monthly bills  living expenses and any other financial burden that may come up. She is facing months of unpaid time off from work for approximately 6 months or longer.     I am asking for any amount of support you can give  whether it's financially  good vibes  prayers  or sharing this story with everyone you know. Any support will be greatly appreciated.                                                                                                              Thank you so much!,1640,10000,5,16,13,221,7
Help Christina Dykenga&apos;s family,https://www.gofundme.com/tcyqj8,9,SUSSEX,NJ,My sister  Christina  needs our help. Due to her uncontrolled Epilepsy she has been unable to work for over 6 months. She cannot drive and can no longer perform any of her job’s responsibilities at this time. House bills and medical bills are piling up and there is no relief on the horizon. Christina has dedicated her life to helping others  both human and animal. She has worked as a social worker for over 20 years  advocating first for mental health patients and then patients with developmental disabilities  cognitive impairments  and behavioral health disorders. She has also volunteered at her local animal shelter before her medical issues prevented her from doing so.  Christina has had her share of struggles. She has a heart condition which caused her heart rate to rise to 160 beats per minute even at rest. She began seeing a wonderful cardiologist who diagnosed her condition  attempted to treat her with 8 ablations  and ultimately implanted a pacemaker at the age of only 36.  Last year she developed heart failure  without a definitive cause.Christina also suffers from Epilepsy. She began having seizures at 17 years old. She went many years seizure-free before becoming unstable again in 2009. Since 2016  it has been a struggle for her specialists to control her seizures with medication. She’s gone through numerous medications  dosages  even the implantation of a Vagal Nerve Stimulator to help control her seizures.  All of these treatments have worked only in the short term  so during times when her epilepsy is uncontrolled Christina has been forced to take disability when she was unable to drive or work. This loss of income  along with medical bills from hospitalizations  treatments  and diagnostics  has made paying the family’s household bills difficult. We are asking for your help. Christina has always helped others in any way she could  and now she needs help.,4560,7500,24,61,57,113,7

Help save my Home,https://www.gofundme.com/e5dh7-help-save-my-home,6,ODESSA,TX,I've had MS for almost 20 years and just recently my daughter (caretaker) had open heart bypass surgery. We've lived here for those twenty years and need major repairs to maintain our home just to meet my insurance underwriter's demands to continue coverage and still meet my mortgagor's needs for their lending requirements. Just to obtain an appraisal will require  new roofing. We have no other funds available and I'm dependent on disability income just to pay everyday expenses. A carport roof and side entrance way will have to be torn down and replaced so the roofing will be on a slant to meet the underwriter's demands. They will not cover any flat roofing (a feature in some 50's southerwestern housing) and they have also excluded my gabled roofing because of the minimal flat roofing on my property. If my funding exceeds those needs  the additional monies are to be used for handicapped accessibility features (larger doorways  ramps  bathroom aids  etc.) I hope to have the roofing done by April 2019 (six months from now) and continue to reside here for the remainder of my life.,6585,10000,10,66,32,242,7

Helping Hand for Josh Villebrun,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-hand-for-josh-villebrun,7,TOWER,MN,Here is a little about Josh.He has struggled with mysterious health conditions his whole life. At a young age he shocked his doctors when they had to diagnose him with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  However this didn't stop him from pursuing his dream of becoming a cop. He was one of the youngest Officers in the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be promoted to Lieutenant.  He has always dedicated his life to helping others  not only in Law Enforcement  but also as an EMT on both the Bois Forte and Tower Area Ambulance Services. He served the Bois Forte reservation for several years before being reluctantly forced into an early retirement  at 32.He is selfless  courageous and a fighter through and through. His recent medical diagnosis started back in July of 2017 when he started having dizzy spells and blackouts often causing distress and trouble walking. A few months later  in September  his local doctors could no longer help him  so he was referred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN.  He was told at this time that he needed to go on medical leave.From October to December 2017  he spent six weeks meeting with several doctors and specialists  having tests run to find a reason for his failing health and help treat his symptoms. He was ultimately diagnosed with severe autonomic neuropathy and severe peripheral neuropathy in his feet  legs  and hands. January 2018 he made the incredibly heartbreaking decision to take medical retirement from his position as a Lieutenant with the BIA. Then this past spring  his health took a turn for the worse.  He suffered a deep vein thrombosis  pulmonary embolism  and staff infection.  Essentially his sickness made his his blood very toxic which attacked his organs.  He was placed in the ICU at Saint Mary’s  at Essentia in Duluth  unable to breath on his own.  His family was told his chances of surviving were slim. Then a miracle happend  and he came through at the end of May. His recovery was miraculous  but the celebration was short lived. In July he found a blister on his foot. Due to his body never fully recovering  his healing process is significantly low  so the blister became worse and eventully very infected. He had several consultants with various specialists  but a staff infection set into his bone.  He was told that amputation would be the only life saving option.September of 2018  he received an amputation  below the left knee.  All of these have induced financial and emotional stress on him and his family. He has essentially given up everything to fight for his life.  He finally agreed to put his pride on hold and allow his friends and family to try and help him recover financially. We have no doubt that he will come through this hardship as he has with any other  with a smile on his face telling some kind of silly jokes  or laughing at himself. However  he needs some help and encouragment. He is such an amazing person and has gone through so much in his short life.  Any support you give will be greatly appreciated  and he and his family will be forever grateful. Thank you.,1640,10000,8,16,35,387,7

CTi Knee Brace for Carl Finkbeiner,https://www.gofundme.com/cti-knee-brace-for-carl-finkbeiner,8,FAYETTEVILLE,AR,"In August of 2017  Carl suffered an ACL and MCL blowout.  Without insurance he was unable to receive an MRI.  His physical therapist was 98% sure it was both that had been torn.  The surgery would have been 12 000 to 30 000 dollars.  Being a single father of three children  this was not something Carl could afford.  This knee brace would be life changing for Carl in many ways.  He was an avid BMX rider and is a very active father.  To make matters worse  he recently had a lawn mower accident that completely removed his big toe.  The medical bills for this will surely prevent him from being able to purchase the knee brace.  He had posted on Facebook \All I want for Christmas\"" with this Amazon link:  https://www.amazon.com/Ossur-Knee-Brace-Protection-Anti-Migration/dp/B07FYSJYGJ/ref=sr_1_18_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1534805309&sr=8-18&keywords=cti%2Bknee%2Bbrace&th=1 . This just breaks my heart.  Carl is one of the kindest  most generous men I have ever met.  The idea that because of our broken health care system  he won't be able to ride his bike again or play with his kids the way he's used to is just devastating.  If you can donate even a couple dollars  please know that it will 100% be used to help this man and his beautiful family.  If you can't afford to donate  please share this page. Thank you! ^His recent toe injury.  OUCH!""",290,1000,11,29,7,52,7

What a shock to her and the family to hear this news so suddenly and unexpected. A diagnosis no one is prepared to hear. Its fast growing and too aggressive to remove surgically at this time so she will proceed with chemo first then that will be later.  Despite this news Amy carries a positive spirit and a willful attitude to do whatever it takes.  Amy is a single mother of two very bright and beautiful children. Life is tough as it is without cancer invading it and creeping in and taking hold. The children can't really process this news. How can they  their too young to really understand. She displays a positive attitude anyway and smiles thru the worry that she's burying inside. She has to  she's Mommy after all. Wonder Women of many talents. She is a tough little gal and is determined to beat this disease!  She struggles as it is to provide for her children on a single income. Her medical bills are already coming in as she's had several test to confirm this diagnosis  and this is just the beginning.  The beginning of a long journey ahead of her. She runs from appointment to appointment which she has had to take off work for. She will need to take some time from work during her chemo to adjust and recover. She's a very hard worker but will be knocked down for a little while unable to work making it hard to survive and keep the bills paid for her little family. These funds would help with her medical bills that are rolling in and with her family bills while she receives her treatments.  She has a long road ahead but I have no doubt she will conquer it all.  No amount is too small. Any amount is greatly appreciated. We thank you very much for your support and your continued prayers. We know without you as a community helping her and praying for her  the treatments and cost would become overwhelming. I have no doubt Amy will be healed in no time and be back to living life to the fullest with her children. Again  from our family to yours we appreciate you. We are stronger together than we are alone.,2230,5000,7,45,38,497,7

Carrie has been on the wait-list for 5 months now  and the surgeons believe that her call will come at any time.Carrie has rocked every other surgery she's ever had  even leaving the hospital after her 3rd open heart in 5 days  instead of the 10-14 the doctors had told her to expect! She never gives up  and she's continually pushing herself to keep moving  keep working  keep in shape  eat healthy  reduce her stress  and do everything she can to defy expectations.While she has been waiting  Carrie has a weekly hour-long drive to the hospital for various testing and check-ins. These take all day  with mileage to/from  parking fees in downtown Philadelphia  and meals for Carrie and her caregiver.Additionally  Carrie has continued doing all that she can to preserve the function that she does have. To do this she routinely sees a massage therapist  a chiropractor  and a naturopath  and uses a variety of vitamins and supplements to give her body a little oopmh  none of which are covered by her insurance.Meanwhile  Carrie's body continues to decline. On the outside she looks normal  but on the inside her body is struggling. She has consistent swelling in her feet/ankles/legs  which make movement painful  and takes more energy for her body to operate. Since she has been listed her stamina and overall energy levels have gone from being able to do some yard work  to barely being able to keep up with housework. By the end of most days her ability to prepare meals or do basic chores is exhausted. Things that would helpful to her right now would be a house cleaning service  prepared meal delivery  extra funds to pay for the costs not covered by insurance (such as the gas  parking  supplements  and massage).Our goal is to raise $12 000 to provide support for her costs not covered by insurance  to hire in a cleaning service  for a prepared meal service  and more!We would be very grateful if you could support her by making a donation to her GoFundMe page and then sharing it with your social network.  Please know that even a small amount helps get us closer to our goal  and more able to help Carrie in being the most prepared  and healthiest she can be going into her transplant.If you'd like to sponsor a specific part of her care here are some suggested amounts:Weekly massages at $80/sessionBi-weekly chiropractor treatment at $75/visitWeekly therapy/counseling: $120/sessionMonthly supplement costs: $280Bi-weekly house cleaning: we believe this will be in the range of $125-150 per visitWeekly meal delivery: we believe this will be $80-100A recliner for rest periods and post-surgery: $1500Monthly payment on her articulating base bed (which she uses to get her feet up to reduce swelling  and will use post-surgery to sleep more upright while her chest and abdomen heal): $250Carrie at 1-1/2 years  in the hospital battling an infection.Age 4  after open heart surgery #2Being wheeled back to the OR with mom & dad for open heart surgery #3  Mayo Clinic  August 2001Heading home from Mayo in 6 days! 12 August 2001Pre-op to get her pacemaker replaced in 2009 with mom  dad  and \Carrie's\"" anesthesiologist  MarkFulfilling a Bucket List item to see Jimmy Buffett at Red RocksWaiting for *another* procedure  November 2017.""",2370,12000,16,20,23,98,7

Fight for Jazz&apos;myne,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-for-jazz039myne,0,ORLANDO,FL,October 4  2018To Whom This May Concern My name is Shekia Lynch  the wife of James Lynch Sr. We are the proud parents of seven beautiful children  who we are raising in Orlando  Florida. I am writing this correspondence on behalf of our five-year-old daughter Jazz'myne Lynch. As I pen this open letter  my heart is broken  and my spirit is shaken. In the Spring of 2018  Doctors at Nemours Children’s Hospital  discovered a small mass on the left side of our daughter’s brain. The initial assessments by Doctors  led us to believe she had esotropia after visible changes in the location of the pupil in her eye. After additional test such as MRI's and a CT Scan  it was confirmed that our baby had a brain tumor. As we received further consultation with her doctor  he informed us that Jazz'myne had a brainstem tumor  which was also Cancerous. Upon hearing the diagnosis from the doctors at Nemours Children’s Hospital  our family was devastated  our faith fragile  as our lives would change forever. I remember vividly sharing the news with our children about her diagnosis and they couldn't stop crying or asking questions  which I nor my husband James couldn’t answer definitively. Our unwavering faith in God is being tested in a way  that we have never experienced before as a family. We all rally around Jazz'myne to provide her the love and support she needs day to day. But that doesn't change the pain  tears and discomfort our child experiences with each weekly chemotherapy treatment or her inquisitive nature  that leads to questions about the port placed under her skin. If you knew our princess  you would know that she has a bigger than life bubbly personality and persona. Jazz'myne is an old soul  ahead of her time  that always has a smile on her face  as she finds a way to put a smile on yours. These days the smiles seem few and far in between  as we adjust to new norms but it's hard and sometimes unbearable. I was employed through a temp agency but due to our daughter’s health  it's been challenging financially because of having to accommodate her health needs. We are vulnerable and reaching out to you today  in hopes that you would be gracious and compassionate in supporting Jazz’myne and her go fund me campaign. Please help us by joining the fight  as we fight for Jazz'myne. 20% will go towards keeping a smile on her face and 80% will go towards her unforeseen medical bills. Sincerely  The Lynch Family,3511,10000,14,35,61,307,7

Medical expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/knb8a-medical-expenses,0,COLORADOSPRINGS,CO,Update on luke- On December 17th the doctors decided to remove his NG Tube and give him a 3 week trial run without it. The 3 weeks have not gone as hoped.   They wanted to see him gaining weight unfortunately that has not been the case. On January 7th I had to call in to the doctors to give them his weights over the 3 weeks. They have decided that the NG Tube will be placed back in and nightly feeds will resume. We will also need to discuss G-Tube placement which goes directly into the stomach. That would require him to have surgery to have it placed. At this point we don't see him growing out of this. It could be a lifelong condition which is completely heartbreaking. So many of you know by now our son luke has been in the hospital. He is classified failure to thrive and malnourished he is 44lbs. His stomach does not work how it should. He has been brave through all of this. He has had multiple test  Ivs  and NG tubes. He will come home with the tube in place and may also still need to get a Gtube put in. We are raising funds to try and recoup from all the expenses so far and more to come. I make multiple trips a day back and forth to the hospital  days off work have had to happen. Its been a long road so far and even longer road ahead of us. Many of you know I don't like asking for help so this is really hard. I appreciate each and everyone of you that has already reached out to me about Luke.. Thank you all. Jenna,415,5000,2,8,7,271,7

Get 3 legged Inti to his new home,https://www.gofundme.com/get-3-legged-inti-to-his-new-home,7,7244PN,PE,Meet Inti  the bravest and sweetest dog in Peru!Machu Picchu - 30 September 2018After a three-day trek to Machu Picchu (which was already quite an adventure because of the strikes and protests in the villages on the way) we walk along a train track and I see a seriously injured dog that has been struck by the train along the river. The dog is missing half a leg  he is bleeding violently and his bones are sticking out of his paw. Without hesitation  I take the dog into my arms  and along with my two travel companions Sam and Joshua start walking to the next village  which is still an hour away. On the way  we fortunately encounter a girl with a first aid kit so we can connect the leg a bit. After walking for a while  we waved down a tourist bus who was kind enough to let the dog and I take a ride into the village. Fortunately  I soon see Jelmer and Janneke from our trekking group  who saw the little dog with all four legs happily chasing butterflies just half an hour before. Together we carry the dog through the whole village by looking for a veterinarian  but it turn out that the little village doesn’t have one. We have decided to called  him ‘Inti’ in the meanwhile  which translates from the Quecha (Inka) language to mean 'Sun’ because he really is a ray of sunshine. Everyone he encounters has been touched by his friendly face and loving spirit. We were determined to find help for this dog and ventured through three clinics all rejecting us before we found a kind hearted human doctor who helps us to contain the wound temporarily. The doctor went a step further and arranged a veterinarian in Cusco  a bigger town six hours away. The veterinarian agreed to do an emergency operations immediately and I decided that I will take a train back to Cusco from the village that evening to save what remained of the dog’s paw and any other possible injuries he could have sustained. After overcoming a tremendous amount of obstacles to be able to travel with Inti  we finally managed to get on the train to Ollantaytambo and onto a taxi to Cusco in the middle of the night  where the vet is waiting. The wonderful veterinarian  Walter  who calls himself a 'dogtor' operated immediately and amputates his paw  the operation took three hours from 0:30 am to 3:30 am. Afterwards  Inti slept and the next day  Janneke and I can pick him up at the dogtor. Inti is recovering and making progress as we speak. It will take time to adjust to his new body but I can see that he is trying his hardest. Now a new question arises; What are we going to do with Inti?At the moment we are staying with Inti in an AirBnB in Cusco  but being a street dog with a disability would be far too difficult for him at this time of healing so we want to give him a home in the Netherlands to provide him with the love and care that he deserves as he recovers from this terrible incident. Inti is genuinely the sweetest dog we’ve ever met. However transporting a dog from Peru to the Netherlands isn’t cheap  that’s why we ask you for your help on World Animal Day!,1061,1000,32,106,28,31,7
Wheelchair Van For My son Hunter,https://www.gofundme.com/wheelchair-van-for-my-severely-son,7,Orléans,ON,This is my son Hunter  he has Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy. It's a neuromuscular disease which is progressive. I recently got custody of Hunter and his brother and we are slowly trying to make things accessible for him. One of the things that we weren't expecting was to have to buy an accessible vehicle. The one Hunter was gifted through various charities wasn't surrendered at the time of custody being attained. His mother chose to keep it to sell for profit. The kicker is that we can't use any of the same charities to get another vehicle for him leaving us with no choice but to buy it on our own. We are looking to be buy a used vehicle for him that can run anywhere around 30-35k. We aren't people who ask for help but we have a lot of expenses right now with making the house accessible for him that it's not in our budget.

Dios los Bendiga   y Que Diosito les devuelva en gracia cada granito colaboradoThree days ago  we received the unfortunate news that our mother  who has been battling with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Disease  could no longer continue to receive medical treatment as it has become life threatening at this point. But thankfully  we have also been relying on alternative/oriental medicine as well  which has been what has provided her with strength to keep fighting for her life. But in order for us to continue with the alternative treatment  a total of $20 000 is needed. This is our last and only hope God has granted us to help our mother back to health. So we ask of you  to please help in any way you see fit in order for us to provide our mother with the life she deserves. We have faith that God has the final answer for our mother’s life. No one else can decide when her last day on earth will be  but that doesn’t mean we will give up trying in any way we possibly could.

Supporting Sadie Jane,https://www.gofundme.com/supporting-sadie-jane,9,READING,PA,On Friday  September 28th Sadie Jane DeArmas surprised everyone and made her entrance into this world. Tony had been forced to race home from a project with a company he had just begun working with. Katie was admitted to the hospital with severe preeclampsia and rapidly spiking blood pressure. Katie was given the first of two steroid shots over 24 hours  hoping to speed up Sadie's lung development to give her the best chance of survival should she need to be delivered early. Katie was placed on a magnesium sulfate IV and restricted to bed rest for 36 hours. This regimen seemed to work and Katie was moved out of ICU. The joy and relief we felt was quickly squashed as Katie's blood pressure spiked again  and dangerously high at 198/109. An immediate emergency C-section was required to save the lives of both Katie and Sadie.  Thank God and an incredible team of doctors  Sadie was delivered safely and Katie's life was spared. Katie began another 24 hours of IV magnesium and Sadie  born 7 weeks early  was placed on machines to help her breathe  an IV and a feeding tube and sent immediately to the NICU. Sadie will remain in the hospital in the NICU until she can mature  gain weight and learn to breathe and eat without assistance. We are grateful for our blessings and that both Katie and Sadie are alive and working towards recovery  but we are overwhelmed with mounting medical bills and expenses. Katie will need to remain out of work and Tony will remain home as long as possible to help Katie recover and be able to attend to Sadie in the NICU. Katie is unable to drive and needs to be transported to visit Sadie constantly to learn to care for her unique needs and pump and deliver breast milk essential for Sadie's survival. At the same time  we are working to maintain as much normalcy as possible for our 4 older boys. They are so excited about their new little sister  but their lives  school  sports and needs are ongoing and unchanging. We have no income currently and have depleted all savings. We are asking for help because we are in great need and are unable to manage on our own. We are so grateful for all of the support and love we have been shown by our family and friends. God has blessed our family and we ask that you lift us all up in prayer at this difficult time in our lives. We cannot do this alone or through our own strength.,2820,7000,11,40,34,240,7
Tom Stuebs beat Cancer now open heart battle!,https://www.gofundme.com/tom-stuebs-cancermedical-donations,1,WEYAUWEGA,WI,Hello all  my name is Daniel! My goal here  which I feel is an important one at this time  is to raise money for my father  Tom Stuebs.  He recently completed his last chemotherapy session to treat an aggressive cancer called B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.  We hope and pray that the treatments have killed all the cancer cells. This type of cancer is very aggressive and luckily they caught it before it spread to his brain and spine.  Sadly  the cancer was only part of his health complications.  Now that he has completed the chemotherapy treatments his doctors can now focus  once again  on his heart complications.  My father has had Coronary Angioplasty and Stenting done in the past.  It has kept him feeling fairly good and helped for awhile.  It is actually part of the reason the doctors were able to catch his cancer early on.  As of March 5th  Tom has underwent carotid artery and triple bypass surgery and has returned home for recovery. My Dad has been very upbeat and positive through all of this and it’s been nothing but inspiring and remarkable seeing him persevere through this.  My dad hasn’t been able to work since he started treatments in May.  My mother along with family have been trying their best to help make ends meet.  As most of you know it’s very difficult to live off one income this day and age  then to add on these medical expenses have been brutal and very stressful to the whole family.  My dad is a very hardworking  honest  self-sustaining and prideful man.  He hates to have to ask anyone for help with his expenses and the bills that keep piling up every day.  I have talked to him about options to try and raise money like having a benefit and a Gofundme page seemed like a good route to try. We would greatly appreciate any help or donotions to get my family through this unexpected setback. Thank you  from the Stuebs family!,605,10000,9,6,10,96,1

Help Shannon beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/rbp39z-help-shannon-beat-cancer,1,WINNEBAGO,IL,2018 has been a year of changes and adventure for the Johanning family. In January  Shawn took a new job in North Carolina which left Shannon home in Illinois with the kids to wrap things up with the house and their life. Then 7 months later on July 4th they were all reunited together in North Carolina ready to start their dream and new life and adventure there.But  in August  just one month after their move  Shannon found a mass in her breast. Having no family history  nor any risk factors  their world was forever changed on Aug 22 when she was diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer. Since diagnosis day  things for treatment are unraveling quickly  and she's already under gone a double mastectomy to remove the cancer. The cancer was aggressive enough to mandate chemo.  At this point  we know she is going to undergo chemo in the next month and possibly need radiation as well.  After all that she will still have surgeries to finish reconstruction. Unfortunately the duration of the extensive treatments she will need will extend for several months to come.This diagnosis has not only emotionally devastated the family  but it has completely changed the path they envisioned for their new adventure in a new home and a new state. At the time of diagnosis  Shannon had not gone back to work  and at this point is unsure when she will be well enough to return. They are very new in their community with most all of their support hundreds of miles away. Shawn's new job is providing the insurance that has high out of pocket expenses. Although it is covering part of the high medical costs  the full treatment plan is still unknown but the medical bills and out of pocket expenses are becoming overwhelming.We would like to help Shannon and her family by providing financial support to off set some of these expenses for her treatments now and in the future. This is in no way the adventure they had planned  but we can help her family during this time by providing support so they can focus on her health and healing. Thank you.,890,5000,13,18,13,69,7
A better life for Tania,https://www.gofundme.com/a-better-life-for-tania,4,PROVIDENCE,RI,Tania is a true family woman  single mother of one  she's the definition of a great mother – a pillar of strength  support  and discipline. You can see just how awesome of a mom she is when you meet her son. Beyond her family  Tania is also a great friend and is willing to go the extra mile to help any way she can.But now  this woman who so freely shares her heart with so many needs you to open yours to help her family as she fights to survive. Tania has been re-diagnosed with stage 5 Kidney Failure  and is currently in the process of starting Dialysis. Tania was previously diagnosed with kidney failure in 1997 at the age of 22  due to glomerulonephritis with a kidney transplant in 2001. She survived and was able see her son grow up. Her normal kidneys have been atrophied  while the previous kidney transplant is now failing at the age of 43.Tania has had some issues with the previous kidney transplant but at this point  she was told she was going to need another transplant. Tania has not yet found a donor. She is currently on the National Waiting List  but that usually takes up to six years. Since this process has started  Tania has incurred many bills. We are reaching out to people to help Tania in the process. Any help will be much appreciated by her and her family.There are large medical bills that insurance won’t cover at all  not to mention regular recurring bills and living costs. With Tania being the main source of family income  there will no doubt be a large financial void. The stress on this family is unimaginable  especially with the constant check ups and hospital visits. The stress that kidney failure brings is enough for anyone  adding in the frustration of medication and prescription costs  which that are being paid out of pocket. The monthly cost are well into the $15 000+ range. The transplant itself will only be covered at 60%.HOW YOU CAN HELPYou can help ease that stress by providing the Morales/Cuadrado family with a financial gift. By opening your heart in this way  you are helping a deserving mother  aunt  and friend  as she fights to get her new kidney. You can also help by sharing this with your friends  family  and your social media networks.

Autumn &amp; Kris Kinney Fundraiser,https://www.gofundme.com/autumn-amp-kris-kinney-fundraiser,5,GREENRIVER,WY,￼Meet the Kinney family. A beautiful family of 7 whose lives these last three years have been such a roller coaster for them.  This past weekend there was an accident.  It started off with a busy Friday  and excitement of getting Kris Kinney’s daughter for the weekend visit. Sunday was also his birthday  and they had plans of baking cakes and doing family activities for the weekend. Things took a turn when Autumn was about 40 miles from Rock Springs.  She went around a slight bend in the road and for a split second saw the biggest bull elk she had ever laid eyes on. The elk was taking up the whole lane as he walked slowly across i80.  Then there was the hit  and trying to steer the car blind as the elk blocked her windshield. Her head lights were out  leaving her even more blind.  When they finally came to a stop   they were 100 yards off the highway in a ravine. It was a miracle they didn't roll the van. All 5 kids being properly restrained were okay. A bump and scratch here or there. Autumn was pretty bruised up with a broken right arm  with a bone shattered into 8 different pieces.  The van was totaled. To make things worse  Kris recently took a huge pay cut at work  so things are even tighter now than they ever were.  With having 5 kids  they need new transportation. So I’m in hopes to try and cut down the cost a little bit  help raise funds for Autumns surgery  and just keep them afloat while they try to get out of these rough waters.Thank you for taking the time to read their  story  if you can’t donate  please at least take a moment to share.,595,10000,11,6,11,82,7
Medical Assistance.,https://www.gofundme.com/stg5ab-medical-assistance,9,SILVERCITY,NM,On Tuesday September 25  2018 I took my husband to the hospital under the understanding that it was something we have dealt with before. Although we were told that it was what we thought it was  Kidney stones and multiple ones at that. My husband has an 8.3x4 cm mass on/near his spine between the right kidney and spine. This hospital bill alone is costing me 7 thousand dollars  of which I can no afford. For years we have been struggling to make ends meet  every so often asking our government for assistance (I.E Welfare  Medical assistance) to which we always get denied. We have to come up with the money to not only pay what we are behind on but come up with the money to pay for the treatments and tests that are now needed. We need to have a biopsy done on the mass  and treatment following that. Treatment may include removing the mass and depending on the outcome of the biopsy who knows  chemotherapy? radiation? I don't even know. He has been my everything for 18 years  my love  my hero  my provider  my friend. I know I may not get a dollar  but if you find it in your heart  and are able  prayers are always welcome  and if you can help financially my heart and thanks go out to you.,870,20000,12,4,9,59,7

Immigration lawyer,https://www.gofundme.com/67sjha-immigration-lawyer,0,ONTARIO,CA,on wednesday 10/03/2018 we received a call from my dad saying he was being arrested. it was 4 in the morning and I can hear my mother’s voice  and I realized something bad had happened. He was detained and we were going crazy praying and hoping everything would be alright. We kept calling in regard to him and then they said he was going to be released that same day. I immediately took off to go wait for him to be out  when ICE decided to detain him once he got out. He was taken to a detention center. my dad is an immigrant  but he’s lived more than half his life here. This is his home  his family is here and we need him. He’s a very sweet charming and funny guy and always took care of us. He never gave up on us. He worked hard everyday  he would wake up at 3am everyday to go work and work up to 12 hours everyday.  This man is my superhero as he is to my 10 year old little brother who needs him during these years of growing and him becoming a young man. My dads Income is what got us ahead  without him we’re going to have to be stronger than we already are to survive. We are in desperate need of an immigration lawyer to help us fight this but we lack the financial part. We’re not the kind of people to ask for money but we would appreciate any kind of help and support through this hardship my family and I are going through. Anything helps.

We currently live in Amaluza  a tiny pueblo on the Peruvian border  and are part of a 12 publisher isolated Spanish group.  It has been a privilege to serve alongside young  strong Ecuadorian pioneers that serve Jehovah with vigor.Unfortunately  my 20-year battle with Ulcerative Colitis has taken its toll on me for the last two years.  The doctors in the closest city  Loja  have been unsuccessful in treating me.  I could no longer leave the house  slept all day and night  and was fighting a loosing battle.A couple of weeks ago  Steve made me a bed in the back of our 1978 Toyota Land Cruiser and hauled me off to Cuenca  where the good doctors are.  It took us two days to get there  but we made it.  The doctor gave me a colonoscopy  and too his horror discovered my ENTIRE colon was inflamed and bleeding.  Off to the hospital I was sent.I am now recuperating \en casa\"" with local Witness friends.  We expect to be in Cuenca for at least a month before another colonoscopy is prescribed to determine my improvement.  So far  my progress has been very slow  but steady.  I take Prednisone  which swells me up  making it difficult and painful to walk.  The expensive thing is the Ulcerative Colitis medicine  Mesalazine  $16 a day.We purchased  health insurance a year ago  but they have gotten into financial trouble.  Just as we needed to use it  they no longer have doctors they pay.  They claim they will reimburse us  at the out-of-network rate  but that just isn't happening.  Other Witness friends are out thousands of dollars waiting on reimbursement from this company.Our income is based upon a simple Social Security check and what money I can make online (I assist people who sell on Amazon  Walmart  eBay  etc.).  Normally  this is sufficient for us to survive here month to month.  We live simply  like the Ecuadorians.  Unfortunately  my work has dropped off  and do to my illness  I found it difficult to drum up new clients.  This emergent event has taken every penny we have and future SS funds as well.  I have to have money to keep taking the medicine.  The colonoscopy will cost another $400.  We have borrowed money so I could be released from the hospital.  We are in need and humbly are asking for help.  This is a difficult and embarrassing situation for us to be in.  It has also been spiritually discouraging  because I am unable to participate fully in the ministry that I so love.We have also determined that we just live too far from civilization  given our age and health.  We have put all our belongings into storage and are seeking housing near the city of Manta on the coast.  We are looking there because the altitude of the Andes mountains has proved to be too much.  Steve is 61 years young  but climbing rocky paths has become dangerous.  The coast is a bit more level and a place that he can breathe easier.  This move is also unexpected and expensive  but necessary to keep us healthy and safe.  We are looking forward to our new  20 publisher congregation (if we can find housing in Santa Marianita) and getting back to preaching.  I have a long way to go for my health to improve  but we think we are making the right decision and that Jehovah will continue to bless our efforts here in Ecuador.  If any of your are able to help us purchase medicine and pay for my treatment we would be so appreciative.  Five or ten dollars can go a long way in helping me get healthy and strong.  Jehovah loves a cheerful giver.  2 Cor 9:7.""",2100,2500,21,84,24,64,7

Anthony Hudson&apos;s Medical &amp; Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/probablynin,0,BLACKROCK,AR,"I'm Anthony. I have two children and my wife and I have been married for 12 years. Three years ago I became very sick and couldn't work  so I started my medical journey. After many  many appointments and false leads  we have tracked down the culprit. Earlier this year I was officially diagnosed with Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis  (ASM). ASM  is a rare blood condition that can involve and impair the function of any and all of the organs in the body. It has taken over my skin and bones  causing almost constant pain  and has now moved into my liver  spleen  large and small intestines  and my lungs. Along this journey we have struggled to make ends meet with my wife as the only person working. The medical bills are piling up and we are getting farther and farther behind on our utilities and household expenses. It's surreal  one hundred years ago people were allowed to die with dignity. They didn't compile hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills just to live until someone else had to wipe their butt for them. They didn't shrivel up and need scooters and wheelchairs. They died. We let them die. I understand that death is unpleasant for those who are suffering the loss  but what about those who are losing the suffering? We celebrate that so many people are living so much longer  but at what cost? When I do finally pass away  I'll leave behind far more than the lives I've touched  and memories made. I'll leave thousands and thousands of dollars in debt to my wife and kids. We are spending money we don't have  to treat a disease that has no cure  in the hopes that I can be a shell of my former self when I finally go. Our state laws say that even if we were to divorce today  when I die  my wife would be responsible for all of the debt we have incurred because we were married at the time of my diagnosis and treatment. (We are exploring our options to combat this  but as of now they're limited.)Let that sink in. My condition is terminal.  I've made my peace with that. The trouble I have now is weighing the good memories I can make with the debt and bad memories I'm leaving behind. Who am I to take those years away from my kids (ages 10 and 4)? But who am I to decide to leave them with that much more debt? What kind of childhood are they going to have when my wife has to file for bankruptcy at 33-34 years old. She won't ever get to buy them a house  she'll struggle to get them a decent car  and she sure won't be able to put them through college. That's just the financial side of it. What about the memories of their dad literally falling apart before their eyes. Two years ago I was teaching my how to play football out in the yard. If I was to throw a ball today  I may very well break a bone in my arm or hand. I know and understand that  but he doesn't. All he knows is that we don't play like that anymore. We used to love to wrestle and fight. We went to the playground and I chased him around. We were able to make all of these memories that we cannot replicate now. His sister never got any of that. She never will. I won't be able to be a goof trying to replicate her first cartwheel when she joins the cheerleading squad. I won't be able to teach her a jump shot or defensive stance when she wants to play basketball. I can't teach her to hit a softball. I don't know how much \I can't\"" I can handle. I couldn't take them out to play in the snow this week. Not that I didn't want to  I physically could not. Where do you draw the line?Do you wait until they're pushing you around in a wheelchair because your legs won't hold you up anymore? Or changing your diapers because you can no longer make it to the bathroom? Are those the memories they really want to have? We have decided to take the time I have left and try to make as many memories as we can. I can't imagine my children one day wondering why I didn't try harder to fight this  so I can't give up  as hard as it is. The disease is awful  but the financial stress sure doesn't help. Worrying about the next shut-off notice or hospital bill going to collections just adds to my misery. Any funds that we are able to raise here or from the information below will go to helping us keep our bills current and paying down hospital bills while helping with travel to and from appointments and my costly medications (my insurance won't pay for some of them because my condition is so rare). Some have voiced concerns about donating via this page so I set up a link for my PayPal.Donations can also be made to the \""Anthony Hudson and Family\"" benefit account at First National Bank in Pocahontas  Imboden  and Hoxie  AR.""",1275,5000,6,26,23,319,7

Cadence&apos;s Battle With Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/cadence039s-battle-with-cancer,9,STODDARD,NH,Cadence has always been a beautiful and vibrant young girl. This summer  her life changed  very dramatically-she became feverish  started to have back and leg pain and become very pale. On August 28th she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia. We are lucky that she has made it through the initial induction of chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth  but she will need 2 more years of inpatient and outpatient chemotherapy treatments.I have had no other option  but to take the next few months off of work to take care of her  which means we have no family income.   I am reaching out now for some help with our daily expenses (mortgage and utilities)  so that we can carry on until January. I plan to return to my position of English Instructor at Franklin Pierce for the Spring Term.Today is a great day for us.  After 5 weeks in the hospital  we are finally returning home for the first time.  Cadence remains in good spirits  and we are hopeful that she will be able to return to school a couple days a week.Thank you in advance for any help you can provide us in this extraordinary time of need.  Brenna  Cadence  and Liam,6943,10000,13,69,103,554,7

He has now started outpatient chemotherapy which involves weekly trips to the cancer center. He also has neuropathy  diabetes  & crushed bones in his feet and ankles that he continuously receives care for.As Houston began his first week of chemotherapy  Joyce had an ankle fusion surgery.  She had to spend 2 weeks completely off her feet and is now only slightly mobile using a walker and a boot covering her foot and leg. She's only able to put 15 lbs of pressure on her foot for only important tasks. She's looking at a 6 month to a year recovery period on her ankle.They both receive in-home nurse & therapy a couple of times a week  but they also have to travel to and from their doctor's offices and pharmacy several times a week for all of the follow-up care. They depend on help from family to drive them to those appointments and help them with home care  such as house repairs  house cleaning  cooking  walking dogs  etc.  Medical expenses  premiums  and prescription drug costs are taking a big chunk out of their fixed income.  Sometimes  causing them to choose between a utility bill or a prescription. I'd like to raise money to help them during this difficult time so they can focus on their health and healing instead of money & bills. Any amount raised will go towards their living expenses - such as utilities  car payments  gas  food  and medications.   This will take a load of worry off both of them and give them a chance to heal in peace. Please help during this medical hardship  if you can. Any amount is not too small and is needed IMMEDIATELY.   If you'd rather give directly or towards something specific  please contact me (sharonr.bryant@gmail.com). Thanks  and God Bless.Sharon  Kim  & Chris,575,5000,15,12,12,56,7

A transplant for Emi,https://www.gofundme.com/a-transplant-for-emi,3,KATY,TX,English:My little sister Emerleny (also known as Emi or Nani)  is 19 years old and is a patient with terminal renal insufficiency. This means that she has no kidney function due to advance Berger’s Disease (IgA nephropathy) for which she was diagnosed at the age of 5. This is the same reason why last year she had to undergo substitutive renal therapy also known as dialysis while she waits for a transplant.However  Nani has not been able to be included in the waiting list because she has refractory/resistant hypertension  a condition for which she has been in intensive care countless times  has put her life in danger and makes her ineligible for such a complicated surgery.This is the reason why it is urgent that she leaves Nicaragua to be evaluated by specialists that can better assess her condition and prepare her for a kidney transplant procedure. This USD $10 000 funding campaign would cover the first stage of the path to kidney transplant with a specialist evaluation abroad  with an approximate cost of USD $8 500 and the purchase of her treatment for the next 3 months  which include medicines and services that are not covered by social security in Nicaragua and amount to USD $1 500 quarterly. We hope you can find it in your heart to help us give Emi the improved quality of life that she deserves and needs. On behalf of Emi and our family we thank you.Español:Un trasplante para EmiMi hermana menor Emerleny (también conocida como Emi o Nani)  tiene 19 años y es una paciente con insuficiencia renal terminal. Esto significa que no tiene función renal debido al avance de la Enfermedad de Berger (nefropatía por IgA)  con la que fue diagnosticada y convive desde los 5 años. Esta misma condición es por la que el año pasado empezó a recibir Terapia Sustitutiva Renal (Hemodiálisis) a esperas de un trasplante.Sin embargo  Nani no ha podido ingresar a la lista de espera porque presenta hipertensión arterial refractaria; una complicación por la que ha sido internada en cuidados intensivos incontables veces  que ha puesto su vida en riesgo y que no le permite estar apta para una operación de tal complejidad.Es por esto que necesita salir de Nicaragua lo más pronto posible  para ser valorada por especialistas que puedan ayudarle a superar esta condición y prepararla para el trasplante.Esta campaña de recaudación por UDS $10 000 cubriría la primera etapa del camino hacia el trasplante de riñón  con una valoración médica especializada en el extranjero  con un costo aproximado de USD $8 500 más la compra parcial de su tratamiento para los próximos 3 meses  que incluye medicamentos y servicios que no se encuentran dentro de la cobertura del seguro social en Nicaragua y que ascienden los USD $1 500 trimestrales.  Apelamos al corazón de nuestras amigas y amigos para ayudarnos a que Emi tenga la calidad de vida que merece y necesita.En nombre de ella y de nuestra familia  muchas gracias.,3245,10000,3,32,35,1000,7

Bye Bye Boobies,https://www.gofundme.com/Nb-bye-bye-boobies,6,CLEVELAND,OH,Hello. My name is Lou. I have had a tumultuous relationship with my breasts since they reached C cup size.  They're much bigger than that now. I have always been oversexualized by peers and partners because of body parts that I never felt very attached to myself.I also deal with gender confusion. To be more clear  I'm non-binary. I considered top surgery for a long time  but finally decided on a breast reduction. My discomfort is not around having breasts  but about their size and the gender attributed to me because of that.I also deal with back pain and go to a chiropractor every 6 weeks. When I first started going it was ever 2. My back pain will likely get tremendously better after this surgery. I teach creative writing to kids and I run an indie publishing company called Purpled Palm Press  which publishes writing by lgbtq+ identified people. I try very hard to put good into my work  do the right thing  and to make other people’s lives better. I'm doing this surgery as an act of kindness to myself. Unfortunately  teaching and running a small business has not brought me extreme financial fortune... yet (haha).I'm trying every avenue I can think of to raise some or all of the money for this. Even if I raised half on gofundme  that would greatly help me. Anything would help.Because of how disproportionately large my breasts are in comparison with my body  and because they have damaged my back and shoulders  I’m considered a perfect candidate for this surgery. However  with my health insurance it would have been more expensive than the price to pay out of pocket  because I have an extremely high deductible.I believe that I will be better able to serve my community and help others with this surgery  because of how much it will help my body and mind. I deal with gender dysphoria in waves  and it affects me very negatively when I am dealing with it so I look forward to feeling more comfortable in my body. We only get one  so I want it to feel as comfortable and “me” as it can be.Thank you for reading and considering helping me.,325,5600,11,6,13,90,7
Car Accident,https://www.gofundme.com/7rvb4-car-accident,5,OROVILLE,CA,Hey everyone! My 17 month old daughter  Peyton  and I were involved in a car accident yesterday. The guy who caused the accident had abruptly stopped in the middle of the road on Olive Hwy. A witness said he was arguing with his wife/passenger and was pushing her. This caused the car behind him to crash into him  the car behind that person to crash into them  and finally for me to crash my car into the car in front me. The airbag knocked me out and when I came to  my car was smoking and totaled in the middle of the road by myself. Unfortunately  the guy who caused the accident fled the scene as a hit and run. Thankfully my daughter and I went to the hospital and we are both okay but sore from whiplash. Due to the accident my car is totaled and not usable. I’m currently working in Chico. This leaves me without transportation to work or anywhere else. Unfortunately my car insurance doesn’t cover replacing my vehicle  and I don’t have the funds to do so. I’m asking for help to get a new car. I appreciate any help. Thank you!,490,1000,5,49,7,120,7

Medical Treament Round Two,https://www.gofundme.com/tyfranz,7,R6W0G8,CA,Hey everyone Just wanted to give an update. The last couple months Ty has been battling with severe gallbladder pain. (On top of the crohns) He has been waiting a long time to have it removed. The doctors are a bit weary with rushing into this surgery because Ty’s immune system is weak and it could flare up his crohns. So Ty has been left to battle through pain attacks daily. It’s been a frustrating process and hard as Ty’s dependency for his pain medication has increased drastically. It’s hard to know that a lot of the pain might not even be Crohn’s disease but rather gallbladder pain. We got a call today and it might be another 3 months before Ty gets this surgery  and that is just so ridiculous!So at the moment we are planning on going to The States and getting a specific procedure done (not available in Canada) that will help Ty lower his medication safely. Ty’s feeling an urgency to have this treatment done due to his emotional state being extremely low and that the meds are causing other severe problems as well. We had the exact treatment done last June and Ty was able to come off all his medications and it was amazing how much better he felt and how little pain he had. We were able to do this treatment by the help of Big Rigs Big hearts. The treatment costs $10 000 CAD plus the cost of hotels  flights  and food. We are going to start a Gofundme account to raise money for the second round of this treatment. If anyone would like to help out  it would be greatly appreciated! Also if you’d like more information on the treatment that he needs to have done please send us a private message. Thanks everyone for your prayers and support. The GoFundMe page is at  www.gofundme.com/tyfranz GoFundMe does take a percentage of the donation so if you’d like the whole portion to go to us you can also send etransfers to Jenny’s email jennyfranz28@gmail.comIf you do send an etransfer please make the password “tyfranz”Please also consider sharing this with others.

Jim Tippin Jr &amp; James Gardere,https://www.gofundme.com/jim-tippin-and-james-gardere,0,VICTORIA,TX,Hello Community  I'm reaching out to you because my Dad and Husband are going through a rough time right now. They are two wonderful men that have never asked for much  and I would like to share their story with you. At the end of reading this  if you are able to contribute and/or share their story that would greatly be appreciated. Jim Tippin Jr.My Dad began his radiation treatments to pinpoint cancerous spots around his liver  hip  and shoulder areas. This was a 3 week long process  along with his regular VA appointments to manage his prostate cancer  diabetes  and bloodwork throughout his radiation treatments. During this time  he was on and off Chemo Pills (Regorafenib). The Doctors felt doing this would be the best plan of attack against new cancers  alongside the radiation treatments. A few days after he finished his radiation treatments  he had a reaction to the Regorafenib. This caused him to have his first grand mal seizure  followed by 2 seizures back to back. He was hospitalized  placed on an IV Keppra (seizure medication) that the Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center Specialist approved  put in a coma-like state  and was kept this way until the Doctors felt he was able to come out of it on his own with responsive brain activity. While regaining consciousness  my dad had to learn how to talk  move  and drink liquids/eat all over again. He did not recognize his love ones  and that was one of the hardest things to go through. Days went by and his recollection and ability to drink/eat begin to come back. Day by day  we began to see My Dad come back to us. We knew we had been blessed to have him still in our lives  and that God had another plan for my Dad. Since we took necessary ER/hospitalization steps  outside of the VA (because my Dad's emergency took place during the middle of the night)  we are now trying to stay afloat with the new medical bills and twice a day seizure medication. The VA has approved and helped with some necessary appointments  but we still need the VA to approve the main ones – the Neurology appointment and seizure medication. Until then  I'm making sure my Dad does not run out of his medication and I'm trying to jump through hoops to make my Dad’s appointment happen.James GardereThe day after my Dad was released from the hospital  James had his first ever grand mal seizure. The day it happened he had just finished up at work  and came home with the feeling of déjà vu and dehydration. (He’s experienced this before  but never to this degree.) He did not feel good at all  and decided to lie down to sleep it off. He woke up about an hour later  and popped up out of bed saying  “Water...water…I need water!” He then went to the water dispenser and I went to the restroom. Once I closed the door the handle began to turn  as if someone were unsuccessfully attempting to open it. However  the door was not opening. I called out to James  but there was no response. A little perturbed  I went to open the door. As soon as I began to do so  I felt the door push back on me. With my leg in between the door  James began to seize and fell against the door. From the movement of his body I recognized the signs of a full body seizure. I jumped into crisis mode. After a traumatic escape from my own bathroom  that included braking our bathroom door along with a few other minor furniture casualties  I used my special needs training to quickly stabilize James and call 911. James seized a little over one minute  remained unaware for approximately 10-15min upon arrival of the paramedics  and he started to respond and come to as he was on his way to the ER.After being placed on the all too familiar Keppra (seizure medication that my Dad was just prescribed weeks before) and having a few MRIs done  James was recommended to an ENT and a Neurologist here in town. The ENT found that James had a robust nasal polyp issue that definitely needed to be dealt with  but inconclusive for the seizure that started it all. The next step was with the Neurologist  where we were informed he had a unknown mass in his brain. For our second opinion on the mass  we then went to a Neurosurgeon in Houston that concluded there was a mass (glioblastoma or low grade glioblastoma) sitting on his right frontal lobe causing seizures. After many questions and psychological testing  the déjà vu and dehydration feeling he had been having was caused by sensory seizures that he had been suffering from for approximately 8yrs.After finishing up testing this week  Dr. Baskin has scheduled brain surgery for Monday the 19th of November @ 7:30am. This type of surgery being performed by Dr. Basin and his Team has about an 80% success rate  so we are hopeful  and recovery time could range from 6 weeks to 3 months. James will be out of work for awhile  but his company has been wonderful throughout this whole ordeal. After surgery  he will continue taking Keppra and will have a few more appointments – Post-op appointments and to look into the nasal polyps. You can help support their GoFundMe by making a donation towards their medical bills and daily medication  and then sharing it with your network. We would greatly appreciate it. I know that money can be tight  so please know that even the smallest amount helps get us closer to our goal! Let me know if you have any questions  and I hope your day is blessed.,500,5000,3,10,6,201,5

Help for my mother,https://www.gofundme.com/5a2j6-help-for-my-mother,0,DEKALB,IL,Hello generous souls My mother has had a difficult and lonely life for a long time. We always strive to do what we can  but her middle age has been a trying battle. In her 20s her husband left her with two children  and on her own she put herself through school to become an RN.Since then  she has battled severe depression and alcoholism. But no matter how bad things got  she always put others first. Fast forward to a year ago when the nursing home she worked for went under and she was laid off and her mother passed away. Shortly after she began to deal with severe nausea. For months she went to multiple doctors to find out what was wrong  and eventually we discovered she had stage 3 liver disease. She has been too weak to work  walk  even stand. She couldn't eat food for weeks. In August she went into rehabilitation for the alcoholism. Just the other day (9/30) I picked her up to come home after a successful discharge.Here's where we talk about the financial problem. My mother owes over $5000 for her house. We have already accepted it will be lost. She lost her cable and internet  which makes getting and finding help more difficult. I'm amazed her phone still works. She has literally 0 income. What prompted me to make this page is this morning she had her electricity shut off and we cant afford to have it turned back on. I live 3 hours away and do what I can to help. I haven't worked for a month so that I can help her. I've done what I can financially but we can afford no more. I'm desperate. This woman is the best mother I could ever ask for and it breaks my heart seeing her hit rock bottom like this. On top of everything  she is dealing with some kind of severe skin issue that has no proper diagnosis and causes her absolute agony. This is truly the last thing I could think of. Thank you for reading our story.,740,2000,17,37,9,36,7
Leonard Mensah / Brain Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/leonard-mensah-brain-surgery,8,BELMONT,MA,Please help us support our brother  Leonard Mensah  as he moves towards treatment for a serious but highly treatable condition.  Leonard has been experiencing brain-related symptoms for nearly a year. Last month he was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to AVM (Arterio-Venous Malformations). In layman terms  this is similar to an aneurism whereby a weak vein is bleeding into the brain. The condition is highly treatable with a surgical intervention. The scope of this operation is beyond the capabilities of healthy system in Ghana. To receive treatment  Leonard will fly to either India or perhaps the United States for the procedure. The costs are significant. Leonard grew up in Cape Coast  Ghana  in a tight knit community surrounded by family - parents and his three brothers and sisters  extended family  and friends.  Leonard completed secondary school and continued on to a Diploma in Software Engineering from Aptech University College in Mumbai  India. Leonard and Eunice married in 2015. A year ago they welcomed their first child  Jody  into their lives. Leonard’s passion and driving professional motivation has always focused on contributing to the greater good. Now he needs us to contribute to his. Please join us in supporting Leonard  Eunice  and Jody. Please also post this to your social media accounts and forward to family and friends so that we can get the word out.Thank you!,4530,20000,4,23,41,876,7
Derek Criswell&apos;s Mindful Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/derek-criswell039s-mindful-journey,0,PASADENA,TX,Friends and Family My name is Shannon  and I'm here to tell a story about a dear family member - Derek.A native Alaskan  Derek is a 29 year-old vibrant  outdoor-loving  hard-working husband and daddy that lives every day for his family and the pure enjoyment of life.  Derek works at a remote gold mine for 7 months out of the year and during his “off” season (winter)  he loves to spend every moment possible with his wife Kara  his 6 year-old son Connor  and their 2 cats.  Fishing  Frisbee golf  playing poker  and taking his family on vacations are a few of Derek’s favorite activities.  Vegas is a favorite travel destination  and his little family has made that location a yearly tradition.Unfortunately  that yearly tradition will be interrupted and put on the back burner for a while.On June 19  2018 Derek was in a terrible mining accident and suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury – referred to as a TBI.  Derek lost the left side of his skull and was life-flighted to Anchorage where he spent several weeks in ICU  had to have a piece of his brain removed  and has endured blood clots  hearing loss   and loss of memory  among other things.  He was transferred to a World-Renowned facility in Colorado by air ambulance for further care  surgeries  and eventually rehabilitation.  Derek underwent imaging that was used to produce a 3-D image of his skull and to facilitate the construction of the plate that will be placed in his head to seal the missing area.  No two brain injuries are alike in terms of consequences.  Similar injuries can result in very different affects.  Some symptoms of a TBI may be apparent right away  but others may not show up for a very long time.  Derek has already endured so much during this journey  and this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Since there are so many unknowns and every person is different with a TBI  there is no schedule of dates that can tell when Derek will be able to drive  return to work  what memories he will recover  or even just be able to fish with his son again.  The entire family is forever grateful that Derek is still with us and is a fighter!  This is where this little family needs your help.So many people focus primarily on the medical expenses incurred in a tragic accident  and while this is a VERY consuming barrage of expenses (and will likely be for a long time to come)  there are so many other factors that need just as much attention.  With this type of injury  there are countless trips in his future that will require long-distance travel.  Remembering that this sweet family’s home is in Alaska  it’s not quite as easy as jumping in a car and driving to a neighboring state which is a luxury so many of us take for granted.  In addition to the multiple plane trips they have already had to make  there are sure to be just as many or more in Derek’s road to recovery and rehabilitation.  And that’s just the beginning.  This little family is the picture of the All-American family everyone strives to be.  They are genuinely caring  loving  energetic people  and are always going above and beyond to lend a hand to those in need.  Now  they need a hand.Derek and Kara have a sweet  sweet little man Connor whose everyday needs cannot be put on hold.  The stability and ability to lead as normal of a life as possible right now is crucial.  While he is accustomed to Daddy being gone for stretches of time for work  he gets to talk to him every day and knows at the end of his shift  he’s coming home.  While we know that Derek will eventually get to make that trip home  this time will be different.  That alone is so hard for a little one to comprehend.  He will be facing enough changes in the coming months and years.  This is why his stability and maintaining a consistent daily routine is so important. Connor is now a big 1st grader (yay!) and cannot just up and be gone each time his daddy has to leave for several days for treatment  therapy  rehab  possible future surgeries  etc.  He will still need to live the normal life of a growing boy  and with that comes expenses.  There will be regular doctor checkups  school supplies  school field trips  lunches  after school (and possibly before school) care  clothes  and ideally the opportunities to participate in sports and recreational activities; none of which come free.Let’s also take a minute to think about Derek’s beautiful wife  Kara.  She will be incurring travel costs for the times Derek cannot travel alone to the overwhelming amount of medical visits he will have to go to.  She will have to take time off of work – possibly days at a time – to get Derek to and from these visits that are going to keep Derek getting better and on the road to a normal life.  These multiple trips will not only have the travel costs of getting to and from  but lodging  meals  and numerous other expenses that can arise unexpectedly.  Kara will also have to solely take on the task of maintaining their home…technically  foundationally  financially  and in every other sense of the word.   We all know that water heaters  air-conditioners  and other facilities in a home do not send out memos to household members before they decide to retire.  With their main source of income indefinitely on hold  things will be very difficult for this sweet family.While an exact schedule of recovery and milestones is not even fathomable  with your help  we can ensure that Derek receives every necessary medical treatment for a successful recovery.  Thank you all for taking the time to read Derek’s story.  Updates will be posted as we receive them so that everyone can follow Derek’s progress.Please know that even if a donation is not possible  prayers are ALWAYS needed and appreciated so much more than anyone will ever know.Please take a moment and enjoy the little snapshots into the life of this strong young man and his little family.#teamderekcriswellLove to all.,2685,25000,11,11,17,125,7

She is quick to help and quick to smile.  This story is about her smile most of all...For years Linda had to take a prescription drug that caused her teeth to deteriorate. She went from a full mouth of healthy teeth to less and less teeth as each dying tooth caused her unreal pain. Throughout her ordeal  Linda strived to make other people smile. Now Linda has had all of her teeth removed.

We are asking any of you who know Linda and her loving  welcoming smile (with or without teeth) to join us in giving back her even bigger smile. For all of the wonderful things Linda has done for all of us  please  let's do this for her.Also--Linda and her fiance Vin would like to set a date for their wedding but the costs of the dentures and the wedding is making even planning difficult.Thank you for reading this  for seeking out the page and especially for helping!!

On February 28  2019  we received a phone call stating that there was a fire in our apartment. Luckily there wasn’t enough oxygen in the apartment to keep it going but the whole place and everything we own is stained and covered in thick black soot. Our cat was home at the time and inhaled a lot of smoke  we got her to the vet and they were able to give her oxygen but we couldn’t afford to keep her overnight  so we made the decision to take her home and keep a close eye on her. She seems to be doing much better after about a week or so  but the effects can always come back twice as strong. We are looking for donations to help us recover and rebuild our lives. We lost our bed  clothes  shoes  personal products  food  appliances  electronics  furniture  Nicole’s art supplies  all of our cat supplies. Anything can help  even just clothing and food donations.

Nita needs our help!,https://www.gofundme.com/nita-needs-our-help,8,Nelson,BC,Dear friends and family I am desperately seeking support for one of my dearest friends as she battles a very sudden ailment with her health. Over a month ago  Nita was rushed off of a movie set with extreme heart pains  that has now catapulted to her being completely bedridden and helpless. Hearing this from someone who has been a sister to me for over a decade  who has always put her friends first and never reached out for help  made me so scared. So we quickly packed and drove 10 hours to get to her. My husband and I rushed to the coast to bring her to her cousin in the Okanagan who was able to set her up in her house and monitor her. On our way there  Nita went into cardiac arrest in my car  beside my toddler  which resulted in her 3rd ambulance trip to the hospital. We had to abandon her apartment in Abbotsford  as she is now waiting on her Cardiologist appointment in Kelowna  and is so gratefully not alone like she has been. So I've never done this before  but at this point it's the only option we have  if anyone out there can contribute to Nita's expenses for movers  cleaners  treatment  and her incredible cousin who is selflessly supporting her  then I can't even explain my gratitude at such a critical time. If you are reading this and funds just aren't possible  then please send my girl a powerful prayer to help her gain her strength back... I wish I could heal the world on my own but it's just not that easy... Thank you all for your time and PLEASE SHARE this page for my SISTER!

Help Richard Fight Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/richard039s-remission-fund,9,OAKLAND,CA,Four and a half years ago at age 24  I thought I had beaten Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  a blood cancer that mostly affects young adults.  After completing six cycles of tough chemotherapy and a month of radiation  I was given excellent odds of being in the lucky 80-90% who stay in remission.  My PET scans showed the disease was gone and I slowly got back to living a life that wasn’t all about medical appointments. During the next four years  I took classes  raised my son  got an apartment and started working as a Catering Captain at Zesty. I really enjoyed the work environment and friendly team  while memories of my cancer ordeal faded from everyday thoughts.However  this year all of that changed when a blood test in my annual check-up was abnormal  even though I was feeling well.  After more tests  PET scan and biopsy  in April 2018 I received the devastating news that my cancer had returned. This time the treatment is far more aggressive and extensive. After completing four rounds of a different chemotherapy called BvB  a PET scan showed there was still an active spot  so now I am having to do another even more difficult chemo called ICE to get into remission.  As soon as that is accomplished  I will be starting an autologous stem cell transplant at Stanford. This is my best chance for beating Hodgkin’s once and for all. It requires a month of preparation for harvesting my own stem cells  a month of hospitalization at Stanford and then at least a few more months at home recovering  all during which time I will be unable to work.This entire ordeal is very difficult financially as well as physically.  I was able to work part-time during the BvB treatment  but now with ICE  I can’t work because it affects your blood counts and ability to fight infection. I won’t be able to work again until I recover from the stem cell transplant.  I still have to meet my living expenses of being a single parent and keeping a roof over my nine year old son’s head. There are also many additional costs associated with being hospitalized down in Palo Alto while living in Oakland. Unfortunately  I was hospitalized for my biopsy during the few days we had to sign up for benefits and therefore won’t be getting any short-term disability through Zesty.  My state disability insurance will be very limited because I was a 1099 contractor during the “base period” used to calculate benefits. I would really appreciate any help you could provide to help relieve the financial part of this battle. Thanks to all who can contribute any amount while I face the greatest challenge of my life.,9150,25000,14,37,148,736,7
Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/vg7d4-medical-expenses,9,FARMINGTON,NM,"￼￼￼￼************* 11/19/18 **********************************Video clip of Trinity's progress from 10/17 to 11/19. I am graciously asking for help to meet the needs of Trinity's medical&travel and family expenses for the New Year up coming appointments in Albuquerque. Thank you for taking the time to read about Trinity and her overcoming her trails. With your help of any amount is greatly appreciated. This will help my family to meet our financial challenges to continue to meet co-pays/deductibles for Trinity to continue her therapies and hospital travels. Trinity is continuing to amaze us and make tremendous gains with therapies. Trinity was 13 years old when she had suffered from a large stroke to her left side of her brain; to which  it effected her right side. Doctors say this is unusually for a young child to experiences(very rare)  and a large stroke is normally common in elderly people; but why  at a young age of 13 and so large of a stroke? The stroke effected her ability to walk  speak  and the use of her right arm(right side aphasia). After two weeks of therapy  she suffered another stroke  \mini-stroke \"" as the Doctors called it. A stroke is a stroke  and by calling it mini  does not soften the cause and effect of it. My instinct  my gut  as well as my husband's  we demand an MRI  hence the mini-stroke was confirmed and not due to a fainting spell. And  soon after  Trinity was immediately scheduled for Brain surgery. A Carotid Artery Bypass was performed on 10/05. Trinity turned 14 years old seven days after surgery  and discharged 14 days after her birthday. She is a remarkable medical mystery to Doctors because all tests came back negative. Remarkably to rehabilitation therapists who never work with a stroke patient so young and who has gain so much in a short amount time. We are very thankful to have our Trinity and she is beginning to be more like Trinity everyday before she had the stroke. She takes everyday day by day and has not breakdown to ask why me? And  I can't be any more proud of how much she has overcome  relearning to talk  walk  restroom  using a fork/spoon  shower  write and brush her teeth. I am so very grateful she is doing most of these everyday task on her own now. I am very grateful for all the people in our lives  who prayed for Trinity  contributed monetary donations (thank you family  friends  and kind-hearted donors). And  Thank you in advance to new potential donors.--------------------10/05 This is a very rare case for someone so young  even for a 13 year old to experience  but this impossible situation happen to my daughter Trinity. Trinity had suffered from a large stroke  which caused right side body paralysis and ceased ability to speak and currently is(10/05/18) going under brain surgery. She/we've been in the hospital at UNM Children's Hospital in ABQ since 9/02. Pervious to the stroke  she suffered a major migraine headache on 9/01 in Farmington NM. This immediate onset migraine caused dizziness  full body paralysis  and disrupted speech.  Since 9/2 and weeks there after  Trinity has slowly regain right side arm and leg function and limited speech. She was making great progress with physical  occupational and speech therapy until a small set back of having a mini stroke again while being at physical therapy on 9/26. After an MRA  this confirm that her vessel had showed no improvements and the narrowing of her artery has got more narrow; therefore  why she has to have this surgery.

resetting my life,https://www.gofundme.com/w4nkyu-resetting-my-life,5,RIVERHEAD,NY,I have lost everything I worked hard my entire life to build. I put all my work and finances into a business that ended up bankrupting me. Depression eventually nearly took my life and at that point I decided to allow myself to follow directions from my close friends and family.I have moved out of New York to Long Island in order to enroll in a continued education program where I could get a scholarship and live within more realistic and cheaper means. I have submitted the application to school (have not heard back yet) and applied for a job at a department store which luckily has come through. I am living on minimum wage but happy about what I have accomplished so far.A couple weeks ago I bought a car for $970 dollars  plus all costs to get plates  title and insurance. Three days later the car went up in flames and blew up. That was all the money I had and having a car out here is pretty much essential as everything is far to get to  plus my work hours change constantly.I don't have a place to live and have been counting on the good will of the few friends I have out here  but it has been very tough. I have tried seeking assistance from Social Services but after several months back and forth I continue to reach dead-ends.I decided to create this campaign so I can put some money together to get myself a cheap car to navigate life out here and all my obligations with work and fixing the mistakes from my past. All I am asking here is some assistance from people who understand what it's like to be knocked down by life repeatedly when you need help the most. Please have a look at the breakdown below:Previously purchased car:$970 - 95 Jeep Cherokee$190 - insurance$60 - plates$320 - Title and registrationTOTAL: $1 540 (this I borrowed from a friend who was willing to help and I must pay back)For New Car (estimating):$2000 - car$200 - insurance$400 - title  registration  plates  inspectionTOTAL:  $2 600SUB-TOTAL: $4 140Housing deposit  so I can have a place of my own: $1 200First month's rent: $1 200Housing total: $2 400Total Amount Required to start life again:$ 6 540.00This is an amount that I feel is realistic  however anything helps.thank you for your time reading this.

Help Jess conquer cancer!!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-jess-conquer-cancer,6,CHAPIN,SC,Back in March my best friend Jess’s right leg randomly began to swell and get bigger and bigger. Finally after the 5th day she finally went to the ER and was diagnosed with a blood clot. She immediately started treatment and throughout the treatment the pain kept getting worse. She went to the dr several times and had 4 separate ultrasounds all coming to the conclusion she had a blood clot. Her doctor continued to try and figure out what was wrong so eventually sent her to a vascular surgeon in July. In July Jess had her 5th ultrasound and the technician went and brought in another technician and came to the conclusion it was a mass. The nurse consulted with her surgeon and determined she needed a CT scan. Come to find out she had a tumor in her leg called a pheripheal nerve sheath tumor this entire time. That surgeon did not feel comfortable touching this in surgery so referred her up to UNC. Unfortunately once referred to UNC it takes time to become an established patient. Her first appointment wasn’t until September 6th. She went to the emergency room in August to get the ball rolling since the pain became too excruciating. She was then put in contact with the chief of  neurosurgery. She had a phone appointment on September 5th and then was informed on September 13th that she was having surgery the following Friday. Jess met with the neurosurgeon two days before her surgery and was told that there was a 5% chance it was cancer but he didn’t want to go over that information because he was sure it was a benign tumor. On Friday September 21st her entire life had a plot twist. She had cancer and then had complications and had to go through a second surgery to stop bleeding and needed a blood transfusion. Jess has since learned she has stage 2 synovial sarcoma. It’s a very rare aggressive cancer that about 1% of the population get. There is also a 50% chance that it will come back and she’ll lose her entire right leg if caught in time.  She needs to move up to Chapel Hill since it’s over 2 hours away to receive treatment. She will have 5 weeks of daily radiation. Then recover for 6 weeks and next have her third surgery. They will have to remove a huge section of her femoral nerve which controls hip movement and straightening your leg. She was told she will obviously never have that function again. They will also be removing a large portion of her quadricep and surrounding tissue. Her leg will forever be numb and she has to relearn how to walk through intensive physical therapy for several months. She will also need a knee brace to assist her in walking after therapy. I would like to help Jess not stress about the medical bills and the cost of renting a room to receive treatment and again when she has physical therapy. Jess would give the shirt off her back to help anyone and now we have a chance to help her out. Anything is appreciated through this devastating time for Jess  her daughter and her family.,5345,10000,9,53,61,540,7
Taylor (Walton) Davis Medical Fees,https://www.gofundme.com/taylor-walton-davis-medical-fees,9,PORTLAND,OR,My Daughter Taylor (Walton) Davis needs your help.  For those of you who know me  I don't air my family drama on Facebook nor do I ask for anything from others.  However  this is a situation that has effected our entire family and not something I can fix or take care of for her.  On September 6th  2018  she suffered a pretty severe stroke that left her with left side facial and arm paralysis.  She spent 3 days in the Neuro ICU followed up with 4 days on the Neuro Floor at OHSU.  After her fair share of CT scans of her brain and heart  MRI's of her brain and heart  a Trans-esophageal Echo Cardiogram of her heart  it was reveled that the likely cause of her stroke was from a Myxoma found in her Left Ventricle. A Myxoma is a benign tumor of connective tissue containing mucous or gelatinous material. Cardiac Myxomas located in the left ventricular are very rare and can present unusual diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. They may cause obstructions which may also lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism  strokes  and sudden death. We were very lucky that they finally diagnosed her  as she also had a lesser stroke incident 3 1/2 year ago where the Myxoma wasn't detected at that time.  She has been placed on various forms and levels of Blood Thinners as they are trying to stabilize this tumor until her Stroke Team and Cardiothoracics Surgeons can decide on a surgical date. She will require Open Heart Surgery to remove this tumor and this is the surgical procedure we now await. Her physical and occupational therapy have been going great.  She has regained use of her left arm  though it's a little slower and weaker than her right  but she can move and lift it over head now where a month ago  she couldn't move it all. She is strong and young and all the Doctors say she has this going for her in quick and speedy recovery. During this time  she is off work on Medical Disability and her medical bills are beginning to come in. We don't even know what the Open Heart Surgery procedure and stay will run  but she does have Health insurance with a high deductible and out of pockets cost that still must be met.  Because of this we are looking for anything you can give to help her with her medical expenses upcoming and ongoing.,3465,5000,11,69,42,315,7
Medical Mission Fall 2018,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-mission-fall-2018,7,MORRISTOWN,NJ,I want to ask all my friends to help me out with a donation for my November medical mission. Every six months I take off work to travel to a cluster of villages on the Dominican border with Haiti. I'm with a small group of medical professionals that provides medical assistance to undeserved areas where people live who would otherwise not get healthcare. I'm amazed at how much our little group can accomplish with so little! No one is paid. No one has a free ride. We have to pay for the flight there  as well as a lump sum for the bus  lodging  food  etc. We work long  hard  hot days. The people there have come to know us and trust us. With the computer system we've built (much of it  paid for using donations from my friends)  we're keeping track of their progress to see how effective our visits are. We're providing the same basic medical care you would get from your doctor--mostly hypertension  diabetes  asthma  heart disease  etc. With early treatment for these everyday medical problems  we help the people live longer  healthier  more productive lives. If a farmer gets sick and can't provide for their family  then they could all end up destitute. There's no way I could do these missions by myself. My friends have helped me offset the $1000 per mission cost each trip. These donations don't over all my costs  but a lot of it. It's the only way I could afford to o this every six months. The next mission is this November and I need financial help to do this work again. I want to thank everyone who has helped me in the past--I've been doing this for four years. There's no  way I could accomplish so much without the incredible generosity of my friends. If you haven't contributed before  I'd like to ask you to pitch in and help me do this awesome work. Your money will accomplish more used this way than almost anything else you can spend it on.,1100,1000,23,110,9,23,7
Margaux,https://www.gofundme.com/jhatc8-margaux,9,HOUSTON,TX,All who know Margaux can tell you that she is truly one of a kind. She is filled with such humor  lightness  and love that it affects all around her  pulling in others with her charisma and all around positive energy and presence. For 3 years Margaux has suffered from severe and agonizing headaches. Despite this constant pain  she never let her headaches slow her down  competing as a gymnast  cheerleader  and diver  as well as actively pursuing premedical studies and serving as a medical scribe. Within the last 3 months there came a breaking point where Margaux lost her hearing  visual focus and balance that came in multiple waves. A primary care physician referred her to a neurologist for further testing. On Friday September 28th Margaux was told that a mass was found in her brain and that immediate observation and treatment was necessary. With help she was able to transfer from Dallas to MD Anderson in Houston as in the best hands possible. The current diagnosis is that Margaux has a rare form of brain tumor  called a pineal parenchymal tumor. She also is experiencing fluid build up and retention within several areas of the brain called hydrocephalus. She has already undergone one surgical intervention to allow fluid to drain from the swollen brain  and a biopsy. This is the beginning of Margaux’s long journey to recovery. The doctors are confident that all will go smoothly and that she will overcome this and return to normalcy. The next medical challenge is a 12-14 hour surgery to remove the tumor. Afterwards Margaux will undergo radiation to break up the remaining smaller parts of the mass. Margaux has remained  upbeat throughout this ordeal. She will conquer this trauma and is excited to work towards her future where she herself  can one day help others in similar situations  as a physician. Unfortunately  our insurance is not cooperating and we are being forced to pay out of pocket.We are asking that you please contribute in helping Margaux overcome this obstacle and join us as we work towards helping her and her family through this ordeal as much as possible. We are sharing her story in hopes of raising funds for her medical needs  and any/all donations are greatly appreciated. All of these donations will be collected by her mother  Sylvia McCartney  and used to pay for her treatment.,11507,90000,14,13,196,1000,7

#TeamDennisRay,https://www.gofundme.com/teamdennisray,0,CONCORD,NC,For the past year my husband has complained of stomach pain and was treated for acid reflux due to his age. About 3weeks ago he started complaining of a bloated feeling that progressively got worse over time. Dennis went to his regular doc again to check in and they said same thing acid reflux  about 24 hours later he was in such discomfort that he went to urgent care in which after waiting they said we cant do anything for you and need you to go to the hospital for further testing. Dennis is not the kind of person to wait for a long time on things kind of hard headed (as most men are) lol but he insisted something was wrong and stayed waiting in the hospital. After being taken back all test come back ok they wanted to look at his pancreas via a cat scan. During the cat scan they say that his pancreas looked fine but they spotted something else ( heart sank) that was important and they wanted to look further into it. He got admitted and underwent several days of procedures and an endless waiting games  when the results came back our biggest fear had been confirmed Dennis was diagnosed with cancer. This was a total shock for us as it would be for anyone and even worse that we couldn't get any answers on what happens next or really anything until biopsy came back which would tell us what direction of treatment to go in and more information about the cancer it self. After 2 stomach fluid drainings a biopsy of the lymph nodes and surgery last night he was exhausted   not to mention its everything we can do to hold our life on the outside together. We get more results and fears confirmed again we will not be able to complete treatment from home because they do not want this getting to his brain. So today he will have a port put into his chest and a bone marrow biopsy and will go straight into chemo treatment as of Saturday and does not get to leave the hospital and will come back for more chemo every three weeks and the type of chemo he will be receiving is administered over a four day period so he will be in the hospital for 4 to 5 days every 3 weeks and to the doctor every Tuesday and Thursday in-between. I have tried to hold everything together and be a rock through all of this and big shout out to all of our help and support. I have been back and forth a few times a day in between procedures to take care of our animals and other household duties and kids etc... His boss has done a wonderful job of taking good care of him but he will be out of work for about a year is what the doctor is thinking. As you all know this is extremely stressful on us all. Unfortunately bills continue to come and hospital bills are only beginning. Any donations to help us make this journey down recovery lane would be a true blessing and so appreciated. Not one of you go unnoticed we appreciate any help during this journey and god bless you!!!  I am trying to raise money to help our family through all of this absolutely anything in any way of support is appreciate from a donation to a prayer for our family to sharing Dennis story or just a simple phone call to make us laugh and lift our spirits we cant thank you enough for your support during this fight but I know with all my soul he will make it through this and I have faith he will fight hard and it will be hard but I know with our HUGE support team we will beat some cancer BOOTY!!!!!!!! #TeamDennisRay #BeatCancerBooty #WilliamsRecoveryRoad,2680,10000,7,27,37,428,7
Kidney Transplant for Shehan,https://www.gofundme.com/r2qmrz-kidney-transplant-for-shehan,0,Ajax,ON,Hi everyone  thank you so much for visiting this page and taking the time to read my cousin’s story. I know it is a bit lengthy  but I feel the need to provide as much detail to determine if you would like to contribute to his cause. His story  like many  is filled with emotional highs and lows. Bit of background first; Shehan Mathiasz  who is just 25 years old  was born on May 25th  in Colombo  Sri Lanka. He being in Sri Lanka  I didn’t always get a chance to see him  but the few times we were able to connect  his personality took center stage. He would constantly ask me questions about Toronto  and always wanting to play or tell me things about Sri Lanka! He was the happiest  most energetic  with modest means  and that really hasn’t changed to this date in spite of his physical ailments.  He had a difficult life growing up  but always put his best foot forward in spite of issues at home. My family supported him through his education and the journey into the hospitality and tourism studies he undertook at the University of Colombo  Sri Lanka and more through additional certificates to bolster his credentials at the Institute of Personal Management. The costs were steep for our family  but well worth it to see him get the education he deserved  and was eager to see it through.  Shehan has studied and worked tirelessly to accomplish what he has today.All was going well for Shehan  as he even worked part-time jobs at major hotels in Colombo  in his field  while continuing his studies. That is where unfortunately  things started taking a turn for the worst. In April 2018  he started having challenges breathing  and feeling weak. Unable to get out of bed one morning  he was rushed to the hospital. While there  several tests were conducted  which uncovered elevated levels of creatinine and a blood pressure count over 200. Under the care of a Nephrologist  he was on a renal diet and strong medication. He was constantly being monitored for this and with the prescribed medication released to go home. Again  in August  in spite of the medication he was rushed to hospital with shortness of breath  where an emergency dialysis was performed due to very high creatinine levels.  Since that time  he has been undergoing dialysis whenever necessary  based on results from weekly blood tests. The prognosis from doctors is that he has end-stage kidney failure and needs a transplant ASAP. The costs of all the above treatment alone has taken a significant toll on our family and while we continue to do whatever we can  the ask out of this page is to help raise additional funds to help bring forward a donor and help with the costs of the transplant surgery and recovery treatment. I have started this page to help take some of the strain off my family and also in hopes to expedite some of the process that it takes to find a donor. My cousin is just starting his life and has so much to offer. Life really is full of ups and downs  and while this is a significant down point for our entire family  I really hope that collectively through this page and other mediums we can turn it around for the better. Please contribute what you can and help get Shehan healthy again!,13462,35000,36,38,57,71,6

Unfortunately I do not have a lot of support from her doctors   But I have no intention on giving up on myself. I use to  feel alone and embarrassed about things out of her control  I chose not to share my situation with most  I thought I could do this all by myself. Recently I had an epiphany and realize that this  fight demands  so much more than me alone  that there's no shame in asking for help  I've realized that I need my village of friends  family and positive people to fight alongside me. Time is running out for me but I have no intention of giving up.On this day  that’s why I am asking anyone within earshot to help save my life.  I have a plan in place.

Rich Uckert Family Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/rich-uckert-family-fund,9,SIOUXFALLS,SD,“For it is in giving that we receive.” – St. Francis of Assisi The Rich Uckert Family Fund has been created after Rich  husband to Jessica and father to Grady  McKenna and Beau  was diagnosed with Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma in September of 2018. The funds raised from this campaign will help support Rich’s family and help cover his medical expenses.  Rich is a Project Manager at Banner Associates working out of the Sioux Falls and Vermillion offices.  They are originally from Clear Lake  SD but moved to Sioux Falls in 2012 so their oldest son Grady could receive additional medical care. Due to Rich’s intense treatment cycles  it is unclear how much he may be able to work. With Jess caring for their three children at home  this fund will help ease the financial burden these treatments bring. Any donation would be so greatly appreciated  no matter the amount.If you are a family member  friend  co-worker or even an acquaintance of Rich  you already know what an amazing man he is. Rich is a dedicated and hard-working husband and father. Through life’s struggles he continues to be positive and care about those around him  especially his wife Jess. Their marriage is a living testimony to a true partnership’s strength even in hardship. Unfortunately  medical hardships are no stranger to this family.  Their oldest son Grady spent 31 months in NICU’s in Sioux Falls and Columbus  Ohio due to complications during the pregnancy.Rich’s Story:Rich had been experiencing pain in his chest  arm and jaw and ended up being admitted to the hospital for a few days after a visit to the ER. Doctors found a large mass in the center of his chest that was causing the pain. After a biopsy and three week wait  his team at Sanford and Mayo determined it was indeed B-Cell Lymphoma.A tumor board (oncologists  radiologists  and pathologists) met to determine their course of action which started with chemotherapy on September 20th.  Rich will be having 4 days on continuous chemo (with additional treatments making the stay a minimum of 5 days) with a 2-week break for the body to recuperate. This schedule will continue for 6 full cycles. Continuous chemo is the best way to kill this type of lymphoma  but as is the case with so many types of cancer  there are no guarantees. After these first few Chemo rounds  Rich will be checked with a PET CT scan to allow his team to get a better understanding of how well the chemotherapy is working. After that point there are several other treatments that could be in Rich’s future.On behalf of Rich and Jess  I’d like you all to know how much they appreciate the outpouring of love  prayers and support shown to them these past few weeks and undoubtedly  in the months to come.,23282,25000,16,93,219,932,7

Being a private business owner  he does not have health insurance. His health care will be very expensive as he will undergo chemo every other week for 6 months. Chemo alone will easily cost $100 000!! This is not including imaging and appointments  home expenses  comfort items  and time off.The Hawtrey's have a large church family in Pennsylvania  but most of their biological family live in Wisconsin and their oldest recently moved overseas for college. While  sure their church family will do as much as they can for Rick  Niki  Allie and Joe they will still have added expenses and a strict budget! Rick’s businesses are the family’s primary income and he needs to be able to cut back to care for himself. (Though I’m sure he doesn’t wish to do so!)  Those of you who know Rick and Niki know that they always take care of their people. We want to give them the gift of not having to worry about medicals bills as much as possible so that Rick can focus on his health and recovery. You also know they would not ask for this help themselves. Every dollar  and every SHARE of this page will help! If the Hawtrey’s have ever done anything kind for you  please make a small donation and then share this page! Thank you so much! Luke 6:38 “Give  and it will be given to you.

Colton&#x2019;s Care,https://www.gofundme.com/gxdg8v-coltons-care,7,CYPRESS,TX,Colton is our 9 month sweet  strong boy who has endured so much already in life. At 11 days old  he underwent surgery to correct his intestines that were twisted. Now  he has been diagnosed with a rare condition called  “Agenesis Corpus Callosum.” This is where a band of white matter that connects the two hemispheres of the brain did not fully develop  which has the potential to cause seizures  affect motor skills  etc. as Colton grows. So far  Colton has been delayed with holding his head up  sitting unassisted  holding toys  etc. The biggest challenge he is currently faced with is having low vision. Although it seems to be slowly improving  it has definitely affected him doing typical baby activities. Colton is now in physical  occupational  developmental  and vision therapy to assist with his growth and strength. We are asking for donations to aid in his medical expenses for the surgery  the CT and MRI scans  and the multiple specialist visits Colton has had and continues to have each week. Everything is greatly appreciated- donations  prayers  and thoughts. Please feel free to share with others!,2675,3500,14,76,30,158,7

Keep a California RN Working,https://www.gofundme.com/keep-a-california-rn-working,7,SANDIEGO,CA,Dear Friends  Family and GoFundMe Patrons  Currently I am faced with a court hearing of December 28th  2018 to defend my nursing license for violation of probation. I have been sober since May 15th  2015. I started probation May 6th  2016. Unfortunately  the BRN does not allow plan participants to access their records for drug tests  which I find odd considering there is the Freedom of Information Act. Nevertheless  I have done over a hundred drug tests that would show that I am abstinent from all drugs and alcohol with the exception of caffeinated beverages. In addition  I did a physical with a MD including blood work and there is no evidence of history of chronic alcohol use based on our discussion of the results October 3rd  2018. I am diagnosed with obesity and need to lose weight and am willing to do the 12 steps again for over eating. Evidently  I missed call-ins or check-ins to the website to see if I have been selected on any given day once a month for the first two years. The requirement is to check in everyday for 3 years with out fail. Once the problem was brought to my attention I put 3 reminders a day on my calendar and have not missed any days that I am aware of. In addition  I learned that studying languages helps memory. I am learning Spanish  Portuguese  French  Italian  Irish and Russian. So far  I've gotten to the conversational level with Spanish. The BRN's solution is to do a 3 year revocation of RN license. As well as admit guilt to all complaints so they can have me redo probation for another 3 years. I am not willing to follow the BRN's suggestion as I have a 1 000 dollar a month child support obligation to fulfill  student loan payments  and in my opinion a plethora of more enjoyable options for self-improvement. I am requesting 15 000 dollars for attorney fees  court costs and other related expenses in defending my case. I would gladly earn the money myself  however under the probation agreement I am not to work a second job or do overtime. Plus with the addition of 400-500 dollars a month of probation fees on top of my already listed expenses  I am not able to save the money. I already moved to Tijuana in order to lower my living expenses to help meet the stringent standards of probation.  10-22-18\nLatest update: Notice was received that a continuance was granted to reset trial for February. I am confident that a judge can be convinced with my mitigation evidence that I am worthy of a RN license. Simply need a lawyer to present the information. Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely  Patrick McIntyre  RN,587,15000,16,4,11,47,7

Juls,https://www.gofundme.com/4akzvt-juls,4,GLENCOVE,NY,As many know I was in the hospital in 2013 due to medical issue where my manageable lupus became unmanageable. It’s called lupus nephritis. No one knows where it comes from but when there is research I try to be as helpful as I can be. I have been absent once again due to the same issue (stage 4 SLE). To all social media  and dear friends. My kidney function shut down almost a month now. I have been in and out of the hospital and another long 6 months of chemo treatments to come. Please find it in your heart to leave a small donation for a cause dear to my heart as I fight to beat this disease and the hardship it has put me through. I will fight this  win  and then allow every research available to help find a cure. This movie Brain on Fire (true story) inspired me to get out of the hospital. I have had to learn to walk again  and I will! I look like the marshmallow from ghost busters lol and this is just the beginning. A new kidney will not take  so rather than be selfish there are others that need the transplant. As the days pass I got a biopsy for research and for correct treatment ahead. A little girl was on her way to live a long healthy life. Touched my heart as she just checked in. Thank you in advance for all your support. Callista  my angel  thank you for choosing me as your mom as I will continue to make you proud and fight!

MOM&#x2019;S CANCER TREATMENT,https://www.gofundme.com/fkcrf4-moms-cancer-treatment,1,LINCOLN,NE,It’s been over 6 years since mom has been battling stage four stomach cancer. She seemed to have been responding to chemotherapy however when she was just on the verge of beating cancer we lost my father last year who was the sole house provider meaning mom could not complete her chemo sessions. This led to mom stopping her treatment which she sought out in India since we couldn’t afford it anymore due to her being unemployed. She has passed her return date for over year and just recently when she began to experience excruciating pain the doctor diagnosed her with cervical cancer.The recommended treatment requires mom to travel to India for a couple of weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which is scheduled by the end of this year. Although our family has managed to gather some funds for her therapy  it does not suffice for the amount that the treatment required and it is at this desperate time of need that I call unto you well wishers to make any little contribution/donation to help pay my mother's treatment in India. Any other gesture and or resources would be much appreciated. Please find it in your hearts to help save my mom as she is fighting dearly for her life and this is why I humbly request any of you to help us fight back with her.,610,10000,8,6,20,222,6
Help Kevin Jr fight his brain tumor,https://www.gofundme.com/kevin-jr039s-brain-tumor,6,MITCHELL,IN,"￼ Please read about Kevin Jr  he is the kindest 6 year old boy you will ever met. He has lost vision completely in one eye  partially in the other  had 6 brain surgeries  and even had to switch schools because his tumor caused him to need services his small school couldn't provide. Any help is greatly appreciated! Please share so he can get as many prayers as possible. His fight isn't over! Kevin Jr's world turned upside down after a year of struggling to find the correct prescription for glasses. He was first diagnosed with a prescription so high I questioned he could have been that visually impaired and no one noticed. When the glasses didnt work the doctor told me it would take time for his eyes to adjust. After several calls and months  with his eyesight declining  Kevin Jr was referred to a pediatric opthamologist.    The opthamologist noticed Kevin Jr's eyes twitched too much for the machine to accurately analyze them. He couldn't see well enough for a standard vision test and the opthamologist checked his eyes' reaction to different lenses. He was then prescribed an even higher prescription. The new prescription seemed to help him see clearly for a few months.     Suddenly  our family noticed a rapid decrease in Kevin Jr's vision. He ran into walls  couldn't find our house  and refused to play. He was given an urgent appointment where the opthamologist decided to send him for an MRI.    The MRI showed a massive tumor on his pituitary that had caused optic nerve atrophy. He will never see out of his left eye again. The right eye has a slow response and does better with high contrast  but is still blurry. The tumor  craniopharyngioma  has no cure or standard prognosis since it is so rare. So far  Kevin Jr has been hospitilized for over 40 days  had 6 brain surgeries  a seizure caused him to be airlifted  he was sent to the ICU on a ventilator  and has the starting of adrenal insufficiency. The tumor or the treatments will eventually cause his pituitary to fail and he will need more hormone replacements. Every step of the way we are forced to make decision that cause less damage  but keep my baby with me. The doctors removed as much as they could and will monitor it for the rest of his life.\nUpdate: On November 13th we found that the tumor had grown back larger than when it was first diagnosed. Once again  his doctor removed as much as she was able to get. We had hoped to avoid radiation  but now he will need to begin radiation as soon as they can get him in either Chicago or Cincinnati. Both locations are a few hundred miles from our home. He will have another surgery on the 30th to place a port in his chest to be used for sedation during radiation treatments.    We are asking for help with medical bills. We have a high annual out of pocket expense we have maxed out since diagnosis on August 7th  and a new year starting with a sedated MRI every 3 months  endocrine labs  and visits with each of the specialist on his team. There will also be several different therapies: occupational  physical  vision  speech  and possible others added for behavior and cognitive impairment from the surgeries and treatments.  He has lost some of his previous abilities and becomes frustrates with his limitations. He was cleared to ride a bike with training wheels  but forgot how to pedal and broke down begging me to fix his bike to make it go. He is easily exhausted and hasn't regained his stamina. Some of the medications  including his steroid to prevent renal failure  are not covered by insurance.   They say \when it rains  it pours\"" and our family is learning this first hand. A portion of the request would go towards making our home more accessible for Kevin Jr. The stairs leading to the house are a danger and he normally walks up the steep hill  he struggles and is at risk of falling onto the concrete steps. My van broke down the first week he was hospitilized and is beyond my ability to repair. We would use a portion to ensure we have reliable transportation for all future treatments. Every little bit helps and hopefully we can get your support for our son. There are so many giving people out there  I know my son will not be one of the many that loses the battle with this rare brain tumor because they couldn't afford the treatment! Thank you so much for your time and prayers. It is difficult to share everything here.

Monica&apos;s Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/monicaramosmedicalfund1965,1,MCALLEN,TX,So many of you have had the wonderful opportunity to meet my amazing mother  Monica Ramos. Mother was first diagnosed in 2014  with an extremely difficult to treat and very aggressive breast cancer (metastatic triple negative high grade invasive ductal carcinoma). As a result  my mother has endured a many different treatments. Despite the surgeries  chemotherapy  and radiation  my mother has been adamant about working without absence. A very compassionate individual  mom has cared for every student from Reynaldo G. Garza Elementary like her own children. Unfortunately  my mother began to lose mobility weeks before she was due to return for the new school year in August. My mother fell ill  and was admitted to the hospital to treat severe dehydration. There she was diagnosed with several brain tumors that require critical treatment. Since her recovery is of utmost importance  she will not be returning to work. Regrettably  her health care insurance does not cover all of her medical expenses. I have created this page on behalf of my mother to help with medical expenses not covered by her insurance. Mother is a warrior  with a heart of gold  and unwavering perseverance. Any contribution will be appreciated from the bottom of our hearts.,2055,2500,26,82,25,46,7

Help Tammy Tompkins fight cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/tammy-tompkins,0,TALMO,GA,Just wanted to take the time to shout out to our family  friends  schoolmates and anyone who can help with the financial needs for our awesome friend Tammy Shirley Tompkins. We have known her since middle school  High School and stayed close friends even today!Tammy has been diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma cancer. She has already started chemotherapy and they have instructed her that it will be a rough one. Even though they do have a little health insurance the deductible is $6 800 every year and in January will start over again. The insurance will also not cover all the medications that she needs. She has always been a hard worker and will not be able to continue working full-time for a while. The doctors tell her she will get to weak and her immune system will be down too much for her to be able to continue working at her job while she's getting her chemotherapy. This GoFundMe account will be used for medical expenses  lost income  and transportation to medical procedures if needed.Please keep Tammy and her husband Robert in your thoughts and prayers! Tammy has always been a caring and loving friend to those in need!Thank you and may God bless each of you!Linda Harvey Beamon and Jean Stidd-VandefordProverbs 3:5Tammys FB messageHello friends and family. A few of you are already aware and some others suspected that I have been experiencing some medical issues. I went to the hospital on Wednesday 12th with what I suspected was a blood clot in my upper left thigh. They did an ultra sound which confirmed this. When a ct scan was taken of my lungs to make sure the blood clot had not traveled there  too  the ct scan revealed 4-5 small nodules in my lungs. Upon further examination  they also found a mass in my abdomen. This mass was confirmed by MRI and was biopsied. Biopsy results came back positive. Malignant cancer known as adenocarcinoma. After a few more test and exams the doctors have given a more specific diagnosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. They believe this is original place where the cancer developed. The mass seems to all be located around the female reproductive system. Treatment for this will be chemotherapy to start shrinking the mass. As treatment goes on the oncologist will work with the obgyn oncologist and decide if surgical removal will be a possibility as well. I had my first treatment Friday the 21st while still in the hospital. I took the 1st round pretty good and so far I haven't suffered any bad side effects. Nausea  loss of appetite  mouth sores  and loss of hair are common with the type of chemo I will be having. For the next few months  I will be having treatments every three weeks. They will be checking blood work every week. Another CT scan will be done after I have received several treatments to see if the mass is shrinking. The doctors will consider surgical removal of the uterus once they determine that the chemo is effective against the cancer.At this time  the doctors believe that the nodules in my lungs are to small to be biopsied and will be treated by the meds used for the mass.As for the blood clot in my leg  I was receiving an injection of a blood thinner. Due to cost we have had to change over to Coumadin  which will take longer to reach therapeutic level and harder to maintain  but will in the end accomplish its goal. Robert Tompkins and I would appreciate any and all prayers during this time. For our doctors and treatment plan as well as ourselves. We are both staying positive and upbeat and trying to do what needs to be done to beat this. Thank you all for your love and support.,1570,15000,8,10,32,355,7
Help for Mark Assem,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-mark-assem,9,SANTAROSA,CA,Mark Assem is one of the most resilient and upbeat people on the planet  but he is beginning to get a little beaten down by the system.Many of you reading this will know that in 2000 Mark was stabbed in the heart  when he went to the aid of a friend who was being attacked. The attacker was a drunken employee in a convenience store in San Francisco  who amazingly was never charged with this crime. It is alleged that this was due to the owner of the store being related to the District Attorney.Because he was a runner  Mark's tip-top physical condition helped him to make a rapid recovery from the two open heart surgeries needed  first to save his life  and then the second to close the internal wound.Unfortunately the PTSD that ensued has continued to dog him  no pun intended.As he looked at making a new career for himself after this life altering event  he decided to combine two of his loves  animals and running  and K9 Extreme  a dog exercising business  was born.Mark did well  his clients loved him  and his dog buddies loved him more.Some of you may also have seen the Marin Independent Journal article on his courage award from the Red Cross. This was for another heroic deed when he assisted two ladies who had fallen down a ravine in the summer of 2010.Things were fine for several years  however unfortunately he then sustained two work related accidents. The first was in Jan 2016 and resulted in surgery to his left knee. Luckily  he had been able to put aside a little savings  and this was able to tide him over until he could return to work.A second knee injury in Dec 2016 resulted in surgery  amazingly not until February 2017.  This injury was to the right knee but also badly damaged his left once again. MediCal is so swamped and underfunded that non life threatening issues are put on the back burner.Since February 2017  Mark has had no treatment due to MediCal declining cortisone injection treatment  and not responding to further referrals from his GP.  Getting about is challenging  as his knees sometimes give out on him without warning.Mark had to finally enlist the aid of another doctor in order to get the ball rolling with MediCal again  as a result  he finally had an X-ray at the beginning of August. He then had an MRI in late September and now he is waiting for a referral to an orthopedic doctor to read both of those. Once he has an appointment we will know what the treatment plan will be  and how soon he can return to full time work.  In the meantime  Mark is struggling to even walk  let alone run  therefore his business has dwindled. Some of his faithful clients continue to hire him to take their dogs for an off-leash supervised run  but his income from this work does not cover all his day-to-day living expenses. He has not been able to pay his rent for several months  and is obviously not able to attract any new clients until his physical disabilities are overcome.I am his mother and have been helping financially to at least provide some money for food  but as a retiree with limited resources  I am unable to do more. This fund is to provide the resources to cover his back rent  insurance  truck payments and living expenses until he is physically able to work full time again. With these major expenditures covered he can provide food and gas from his part time wages.We sincerely hope that you are able to help  and any amount no matter how small is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your consideration.,1750,5000,35,35,18,16,7

Healing our mom with God&apos;s garden,https://www.gofundme.com/healing-our-mom-with-god039s-garden,1,WASHINGTON,NJ,This is a personal fundraiser for our mother  Evelyn Pocasangre  who has had a relapse of pancreatic cancer. She was first diagnosed in June of 2017. She fought as hard as she could and she went into remission 9 months later. God has blessed our family so much. He healed her after those 9 months and we are so thankful for that  but unfortunately the cancer has come back. She is going through treatment for a second time now and this fundraiser is to hopefully raise some money so that she can have an easier time affording all the proper nutrition she needs. It is extremely important for her to fuel her body with nothing but rich  pure nutrients from the Earth  fruits and vegetables all must be organic and also for some medical expenses to help her heal that unfortunately aren't covered by insurance. This includes acupuncture  all her supplements which equal out to about $150 a month  and most importantly intravenous Vitamin C which actually works with her current chemotherapy regimen and increases its anti cancer effects while counteracting the destruction that chemo causes to the immune system. We are trying our best to keep our mother here with us so that she can watch her two grandbabies  Eva and Gideon grow up  and also another little granddaughter on the way. Anyone's help who is willing to donate  if they want to would be such a blessing and very appreciated. We also ask for prayers and for anyone to share this fundraiser. Thank you for taking the time to read her story.,1494,3000,12,50,31,191,6

After a long couple of weeks  a badly botched biopsy  and a lot of waiting it was determined the ever-growing lump was cancerous and surgery would be needed.  In early December Cynthia underwent surgery that resulted in the removal of her entire thyroid and a full lymph node resection and a short stay in the ICU.  Followed by six weeks of isolation and radioactive iodine treatment which she completed just days before Brett's first birthday.   Cynthia would then live and fight through the highs and lows of remission and the return of cancer.  The sixth reoccurrence would be the hardest.  In 2017 we had decided to move on to a new school and start a new chapter of our lives healthy and looking forward to seeing how a cancer-free life would be.  We had just closed on our first home  Cynthia had just started her own small business and I had just started new teacher orientation at my new school.  Then one August morning I had a phone call during a break where Cynthia through tears told me that cancer had come back.  This was the largest reoccurrence yet resulting in four tumors and she would have to start chemo immediately.  It was so hard to hear those words from her knowing how hard she had worked to get healthy and start to feel alive again and knowing that this would slowly take all of that away.  I knew what was coming and it was scary and very upsetting feeling like we had made it out of the woods and could start to rebuild our lives and begin the next phase as a family.  But  instead  Cynthia would be fighting through 295 days of the harshest and most difficult chemo treatment she had had to endure to date.  Over the last ten years  I have watched my wife and best friend's once vibrant life and energy get drained to such terrible lows in which we have been relegated to hoping for two good days in a row instead of hoping for constant health.  I have watched a woman I had a hard time keeping up with becoming a woman who has to fight to keep up with everyone around her.  I have watched a loving mother have to apologize many times to her two children for them having to have the sick mom.  I have witnessed Cynthia have to miss out time and time again on life events and milestones because treatment and this disease has robbed her of an immune system and forced her to take life much slower than she would like.  She has had to give up or let opportunities pass her by because this disease and its harsh treatment has made her moving forward at times impossible.Now after fighting and surviving the hardest year of her life  she was given a clean slate to finally begin our new chapter of life in July of 2018.  We have moved to a new school in a new city to allow us the chance to be more involved in our boys' lives.  But  that new chapter lasted just 96 days before she was told that yet again this disease that has controlled her life for the majority of the decade had returned for the seventh time last week.  Cynthia will have to begin her newest chemotherapy treatment in a few days and will have to begin her fight again and as with each time we are hopeful this will be the last  but we won't know more until she completes several weeks of treatment and we get a good look at how well the treatment is working. What we do know is that with each new round there are risks. New complications and setbacks that have to be dealt with as they arise. Cynthia has never lost sight of the end goal. She pushes harder than anyone I have ever known no matter the obstacle that is in front of her.  Each occurrence has forced her to work harder and harder to keep up due to the toll they have taken on her.  Cynthia has been debilitated by this disease and the constant fight against it has severely limited her physically.   We have tried every option we can to get through this hardship  but the constancy of treatment over the past decade has put us in a place of not knowing how we may make it to the next paycheck at times.  This feeling that has become more and more frequent with each new recurrence and longer and longer treatment cycles.  This disease has robbed Cynthia of her ability to do what she loves  the ability to help provide for her family.  The last year has taken not only a physical and emotional toll but a financial toll on our family as well. With this new recurrence happening so quickly after the last we have not had the chance to take a breath and catch up.  I can see the stress on Cynthia's face as she has no real idea of what the next few months have in store for her or our family. If I could lift this burden off of Cynthia so she could focus on her treatment and on doing the things that make her feel like herself that would be the greatest gift in the entire world. We have had so many of you reach out and ask what you can do or how you can help us.  You can help by giving anything that you can… This will allow me to focus more on taking care Cynthia and lift some of the stress and pressure off my precious wife that the financial strain of everyday bills and chip away at the small mountain of medical costs  so she only has to focus on her health.""",4530,7500,10,60,58,444,6
Help with Noel&apos;s Transplant Costs,https://www.gofundme.com/help-with-noel039s-transplant-costs,9,BLAIRSDEN-GRAEAGLE,CA,I have been battling multiple myeloma cancer since October 2015. I began treatments in 2016  and now in order to stay in remission  I have to undergo a stem cell/bone marrow transplant at UC Davis in California. A successful transplant  would help me be able to stay in remission anywhere from 5-10 years. These funds would allow my husband  Dick  to stay with me in California while I am recovering  as well as help cover the costs of my recovery and help me get everything set up at home with the things I need to continue recovering (air purifier  humidifier  etc).Without assistance  we are uncertain that we would be able to afford this transplant. The medical costs alone are extremely high  let alone all of the recovery costs. Any help that you can provide will be so greatly appreciated  and I can't thank everyone enough for their love and support through this very difficult time.,3490,5000,18,70,38,137,7

Trip needs our help,https://www.gofundme.com/trip-needs-our-help,0,SANDIEGO,CA,"Anyone reading this who knows my father knows how serious it must be for him to accept help like this. Long story short  His kidneys are failing. Belizean hospitals have done all they can  so he's recuperating and trying to get healthy at the home of his caretaker  Robert. It's been a long time since he's eaten properly  but now Robert and his wife  Candy  are making sure he eats. They're also making sure he doesn't drink or smoke. He's been cooperating so far  more so than any of us expected him to  which is further proof of how serious he believes it to be. If his kidneys can recover  he may be able to regain use of his foot  which is completely numb at this point. That would make walking easier  at least. If not  he'll have no choice but to return to the US for dialysis treatments. Because of the uncertainty  the goal number is fairly irrelevant. He needs right now enough to feed himself  and so it's up to us to supply Robert and Candy  our soldiers on the ground. There are a few lingering bills  but nothing crazy. With enough help  if he recovers  finishing his land will be attainable. If not  recovery here will be. If anyone cares to read further  here's the longer version. Six years ago  the lunatic we all love so much sold everything here. Three shops  a condo  his bike  his Corvette  his tattoo equipment and memorabilia collection  everything he couldn't fit in a truck was liquidated. He then drove that truck through Mexico and up his mountain in Belize  where he had hired locals to build him a house (and holy hell  what a place they built! It's incredible just to think of getting the raw materials to the site...). It wasn't long before the jungle got him  though  and he contracted a flesh-eating infection called \subcutaneous leishmaniasis\"" in one of his feet. Then he crashed the truck and broke a thumb. Then he went through a few pairs of glasses. A scorpion got him on the hand. He lost three cats and a parrot to the jungle  too. All the while  he and his team of superhero locals (lead by Robert) built the tallest lookout tower in Belize into the side of Trip's mountain. The road to get up that mountain is impossible. It's where he crashed the truck  and where uncountable vehicles have been lost. Plan A was fixing the road  a tall task when he only owns a section of it  and the rainy season wouldn't care if everyone was on the same page anyway. So  Plan B was building a helipad  and making connections with local helicopter tour companies. It was around this time that someone to whom Trip gave a career  a business  and a life decided to stop sending \""an allowance\"" for him to live. Progress stopped. Savings ran lower and lower. Eventually he did nothing but drink  and with a numb foot  fall down. Two cracked vertebra  a bleeding head  a trip down the hill in a National Guard truck to a hospital  and 5 doctors later  he is bedridden in Robert and Candy's home. Anyone who knows the full story and cares to motivate the person who cut off his lifeline  feel free. At my father's request  I will not name him  and will only move forward. Thank you for whatever you can give. Thank you for remembering his impact on you and your life. Thank you for stretching his legacy with me  further and longer than he ever imagined possible.J. Trip""",3618,10000,15,36,34,154,7

Family of 8  Displaced after Fire,https://www.gofundme.com/family-of-8-lost-all-in-house-fire,2,VIRGINIABEACH,VA,My name is DeShawn Johnson  a Virginia Military Institute graduate  class of 1997.  On Saturday September 30  2018 while working out of town I received a phone call that my families house was on fire.  All I could here in the background were sirens and my baby girl crying.My five son's  daughter  and their mother all are safe and blessed to be alive.The fire was started in an upstairs bedroom where two of my son's slept. Everything they had was destroyed  clothes  books  furniture  and all personal items.  My other kids items were damaged as well from the water and smoke. The downstairs had so much smoke and water damage that I could not go in and asses the actual damages.We can not move back in and are looking for any help anyone can offer to raise money to move into a new house.   Hopefully we can replace as many things that the children lost as we can.   This fire came just days before my oldest son  Jawan Johnson's 16th birthday.  I still want to make his special day  as special as possible.  He has nothing at the moment and living with a friend until we find something.  My VMI experience has taught me how to be resilient during troubling times and to never give up.  I'm only worried about my children and how traumatic this is for them.  Anyone who knows me  know I wouldn't be asking for this kind of help unless my family really need it. We appreciate everyone who has already reached out and are still helping us. Glenwood Elementary  Salem Middle School  Bishop Sullivan Catholic High School  and the Virginia Beach Mustangs  we are forever grateful for all of your kind hearts and words during these difficult times.Love  The Johnson Family,3990,10000,15,40,46,202,7
Help Cameron Beat Hodkin&apos;s Lymphoma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-cameron-beat-hodkin039s-lymphoma,0,DURHAM,NC,This is one of the harder things I have had to write in my life. I know so many of us are struggling right now which makes it really hard to ask for help. Many of you know my amazing husband and partner  Cameron Gaunt. Many of you do not know that he has been battling Hodgkin’s Lymphoma for the past eight months. We did not want to burden others with this diagnosis from the get go and hope everyone understands that it was nothing personal. It is hard enough to live a normal enough life while battling cancer and not telling everyone around you. Now that Cameron has finished treatment (for now) we are facing the crushing medical debt that comes with a cancer diagnosis. We are still working hard (yes  Cameron is still working fulltime) and plugging away at the debt  but the fact is  the credit cards are maxed and the bills are pouring in. We understand that you may not be able to offer any monetary help  but sharing this with others is still a great help.A little background: Cameron started figuring out something was wrong around January of 2018. Luckily  we had gotten him on my health insurance in December of 2017  since we had been married in October of 2017. Cameron went to the doctor with exhaustion  issues with temperature control  and swollen lymph nodes. Things escalated quickly as he was sent to several specialists. Many tests and thousands of dollars later (yes  this is a call for money after all) we determined that Cameron had Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. The doctors were very positive about Chemotherapy for beating the Lymphoma  and set him up for a six-month regimen. He has come to the end of that six months  and now we play the waiting game to determine if the chemo has worked and what the next steps are. We are extremely hopeful and feel lucky that he has been able to lead a mostly normal life while doing chemo.I will not go into the state of healthcare in the United States  but as two people working full-time  we are not even scratching the surface of these bills. We will likely never do so  but we could use some help to get through the next few months of health insurance and other medical bills. Any little bit helps as we are appreciative of anything people can spare. Thanks for sharing this with your friends and family  it will all help in the long run. We love and appreciate you all.  Love Aimee and Cameron,6142,10000,14,61,76,385,7

Get Mom (Gwen) Back to Texas,https://www.gofundme.com/get-gwen-back-to-texas,7,SANMARCOS,TX,My mom  Gwen Spivey  is one of the sweetest  most giving people ever born. And  she wants to move back to Texas to be near her newborn Grandson (and my son)  River. We could really use your help to make it a reality.In the Summer of 2002  Gwen had a stroke that paralyzed her left side completely. She is a former member of St. John Vianney Catholic Church  Round Rock  TX  where she was a big contributor to the community. Gwen also put in many years in Round Rock ISD as manager of the Central Kitchen. She now lives in Washington State in an Adult Family Home where she gets 24 hour care for most everything she does like showering & restroom breaks. Her weight has crept up due to the lack of mobility so  she uses services to help her get to the bank or the store. The weather in Washington has been rough on her as my mom has had problems with allergies for years and they are plentiful where she is.About a year or so ago  Mom went on full State Medicaid in Washington to go along with her Medicare and Social Security. So  generally speaking  she's broke. You'd think that because she's already on Medicaid in one state that it would be easy to transfer it another state. Nope.Gwen can not apply for Medicaid in Texas until she lives in Texas. Once she applies  it will take at least 45 business days for a response. She should be approved on the first go given her situation and current approval in Washington. BUT  that's still at least 2 months of funds needed to cover her expenses beyond what she can cover with her social security. Currently  the State of Washington pays approximately $6000 a month via Medicaid. This covers a place to stay  proper daily care from staff/person  her medications  etc. We are hoping to raise enough money to get her back to Texas safely  as well as through the transition period between state Medicaids. Anything help you can provide to help bring Gwen back to Texas is more than appreciated. All she wants to do is be the Grandma she's always hoped to be. All the best this holiday season Joey Spivey,630,10000,20,6,11,33,5

Need Help with Medical Treatments,https://www.gofundme.com/6wy9x-need-help-with-medical-treatments,7,LASVEGAS,NV,I have been experiencing treatment-resistant major depression since I was four years old. I have been on nearly every anti-depressant you may think of. For the first time in my life  I have found hope for a cure. Unless you have experienced depression  you probably don't understand it. But let me explain. It is more than sad thoughts and feelings. The physiology of depression causes brain damage  primarily in the hippocampus. It causes your brain to tell you what a loser are every day of your life. It causes your brain to tell you that you will never accomplish anything and that you don't deserve to be happy. It makes it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. It makes it so that you can no longer enjoy the things you used to love. It zaps you of your motivation and your energy. Your immune system suffers  and you are ill more often than the average person. You suffer insomnia  and you never feel rested. The reason people who suffer depression become suicidal is that they are no longer living their lives. They are trapped inside their own minds  which inhibit them from doing anything. Recently  I have discovered hope. A new  off-label treatment may potentially cure my depression and allow me to have a new lease on life. For the first time since the age of 3  I have the chance of feeling the happiness that people take for granted every day.  The pathology of this treatment builds new neural pathways around the damage  allowing the hormones responsible for happiness to travel freely. It does it more powerfully  quickly  and effectively than current antidepressants. Depression has affected every aspect of my life - from my career  my relationships  my ability to care for myself and my home. Currently  I see no purpose in living. I dread waking up every day  knowing I will only feel the same. My life  at the moment  feels broken. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Unfortunately  because the treatment that could potentially cure me is off-label  it is not covered under any insurance plan  and it is not cheap. I will require a minimum of 6 doses over a two week period  each dose costing between $400 and $750. I will require periodic followups after the initial treatment. Right now  I am begging for my life. I have spent the last 28 years fighting for it  but I am losing the fight. If I cannot get this treatment  I fear that there is no hope for me  that I will end up committing suicide because the pain is just too great. I don't want that  and I will continue to fight for my life. But it may be a fight I cannot win. I beg you for your help. I beg you to give me a new lease on life  to allow me to feel the happiness that you do. To allow me to pursue my dreams and my goals. I am desperate. Thank you for your help and support. I am eternally grateful.,1072,5500,10,19,20,174,7

Anthony fighting Liver Disease,https://www.gofundme.com/anthony039s-fighting-liver-disease,9,FALLBROOK,CA,My nephew Anthony 12 years old  was diagnosed at an early age with Autism  bi-polar 1  O.D.D.  ADHD  asthma  and very bad allergies.   He has recently been diagnosed with Stage 3 of 3 fatty liver disease  stage 2 of 3 inflammation of the liver which is now causing him to have gallbladder disease and over working his pancreas.  Every doctors appointment has been showing an alarming increase in his liver enzymes  we are dangerously close to cirrhosis.  Per doctors orders his diet is being changed and we have put him on a variety of different high quality nutritional supplements.  It came to our attention a week ago to try out this type of therapy called Pulsed ElectroMagnetic Field therapy for liver  the doctor that told us about it had heard from a colleague who got incredible results reducing the high liver enzyme count down on one of his patients  therefore reducing the inflammation in the liver.  We are going to mimic the therapy that the other patient did and all of Anthony's doctors are all on board with us trying this therapy but the problem is it's expensive and insurance will not cover this and with all the other mounting expenses  his special diet and supplements we just can't seem to swing it.  We hate to ask for help with this but we have no other choice.  So if you can donate any amount at all even $1 we will greatly appreciate it any amount helps.  We feel we have to try out this PEMF therapy to help Anthony's liver health at this point we are willing to try anything to help reverse some of this damage that has been down to his liver.   The PEMF therapy starts next week and will go for 16 weeks and we will do another blood test to see the results.      Thank you very much from Anthony  his mother (my sister) and myself for all of your help  we truly appreciate it.,725,800,12,91,20,125,7
Ali&#x2019;s Ehlers-Danlos Surgical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/67rwr5k,9,GENEVA,OH,After my Colon Cancer diagnosis in 2011 doctors set out to find a reason behind the early onset cancer. While they were unable to find the cause for the cancer  they found that I had two other rare conditions. One of those conditions is a connective tissue disease called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Because of this condition I have a rather serious surgery coming up on November 2nd. While my surgeon told me I should have had this procedure done years ago  Medicare does not deem it “medically necessary” and I have to pay for the entire thing out of pocket. I am not currently working and have been told that the recovery period is eight weeks. While I absolutely hate asking for help  I would appreciate anything you might be able to donate to help to ease the financial burden I’ll be facing in order to get well. If you have any questions about the procedure or the disease  I’ll be happy to answer as best I can. Thank you in advance for your kindness.~Allison,2492,3000,27,83,35,62,7

Here&apos;s Hope: Mom&apos;s ongoing healing,https://www.gofundme.com/heres-hope-get-mom-to-xmas,0,BurleighWaters,QLD,"For the most recent update watch With Gratitude. Mom always says that \human talents and human energy have the most transformative effect\"". And right now I'm holding onto all the hope in the world that this is true.Mom needs help. In March 2018 she was given the title of cancer patient and had a tumor the size of a tennis ball removed from her gallbladder. They took out a 1/4 of her liver too  and we thought the worst was over.But in the few months between then and now it came back  spreading to her liver and adrenal gland. Oncologists are straightforward in their approach... radiation isn't an option  and chemo will only offer a few extra months.But there are other medical approaches that are seeing excellent results. Immunotherapy is an emerging mainstream medicine technique said to be the cancer treatment of the future. It boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer   using substances made by the body or in a laboratory to improve or restore immune system function. Because so many people are responding so well  there are trials being conducted all over the world to get this treatment out to cancer sufferers as quickly as possible. We're doing everything we can to get Mom into a trial  but gallbladder cancer is apparently rare so there are not many places currently conducting Immunotherapy trials for it.On 3rd October 2018 Mom was told by an Oncologist that at the rate the adrenal gland tumor is growing  it may well get the better of her before Christmas this year. I struggle to even allow myself to acknowledge this in my mind  and my heart just won't let it in  so writing this is incredibly difficult to do. It means that this horrible nightmare is actually true  and that without quick action  Mom is running out of time.They say time is money  and right now that couldn't be more true. We're hoping to find a clinical trial  but without one the only option is to pay for the treatment  which costs R100 000 (South African Rand) ($9580 AUD) every 3 weeks  for 8 months. This amounts to R1 166 666 or $111 742 AUD. If we can raise the miracle amount  then the remaining $8258 will go towards transport and accommodation costs as the treatment clinic is in Johannesburg and my parents will have to get there from Port Elizabeth.I know I'm asking for a lot  I'm asking for the world right now  but when someone you love is doing everything they can to recover and heal  when every day they are looking the fear of death in the face  with a hopeful smile and determination to move mountains  what else can I do? Mom gave me life  I need to know that I am doing my absolute best to give it back to her. So here is my hope - that we'll have Mom at Christmas and many years after. But we need help fast  so right now I'm putting all my hope into humanity  unseen heroes  and complete strangers  who understand that unfortunately we're in a situation where time really is money.Thank you for your kindness and generosity  you're changing lives. And if you know of any oncologist or researcher  anyone or anything you think may be able to help in any way  please please share it with us. You never know if you may be holding the key to saving Mom's life. Thank you.""",6234,60000,10,10,47,364,7

Unfortunately our world came crashing down with devastating news.I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma 12cm which was also double hormone positive breast Cancer.  It unfortunately is aggressive- stage 3 and has spread to my lymphatic system as well. Since the diagnosis I have had to have both my breasts removed ( bilateral mastectomy  axillary clerance and reconstruction)  and start my treatment (chemo and radiation therapy  plus hormone therapy for 5 years) to beat this horrible disease.in process of this my husband has had to stop working to care for our two young children who are aged 1 and 2 plus my teenage son as well as me.Because we are from New Zealand we are not entitled to any financial assistance here in Australia and having to use our savings to buy a house we were left with no money for just in case. With two babies as well  saving money was non existent. We are at a stage where  I’m concerned where the next meal or bottle of milk will come from as there is no income now for two months. The little we did have is running out.This stress is affecting my treatment as I worry about or next meal  next bill while try and fight this terrible illness.We are hoping to raise enough funds so we don’t loose our house  cars  not have our utilities turned off and be able to provide  food on the table.

Help Ian Lamson Beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpIanLamsonBeatCancer,1,CASTROVALLEY,CA,IAN LAMSON HAS CANCER ...Music stands by your side through thick and thin. Yet  a musician’s life is never an easy one. For full-time musicians  it’s kind of a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you are the instrument bringing joy  conjuring memories  playing songs people can dance to  and helping people through hard times. Music can be the light in a dark room. The difficulties are usually little pay  late nights  lugging gear  driving hundreds of miles to play for a roomful of people. Ian was born a musician  he never wanted to do anything else. Ian knew music was his calling from a young age. He’s been fortunate enough to play with the best of the best throughout his career thus far. Well aware of the sacrifices  this was the path for him. Ian has definitely paid his dues  and if you have ever been lucky enough to have his guitar playing bestowed in your ears … you know just what I’m talking about. Now  like music  we need to be the light in Ian’s dark room. In August 2018  our dear friend Ian Lamson was diagnosed with Stage 3 Cancer after discovering a malignant tumor. He is already undergoing treatments of chemotherapy and radiation. The next step in the process is a rather complex surgery  followed by a second 5-week course of chemo and more radiation. The medical procedures take nine months and Ian won’t be able to support himself during this aggressive treatment program. The cost of necessary medications  nutrition  and integrative therapies are not covered by his insurance. Additionally  Ian is required to find a new residence and must stay in Alameda County for his insurance coverage. Finding suitable housing and financial support for the 9-month treatment (and recovery) is our goal. 100% of Ian’s energy needs to be focused on healing.The Bay Area music scene is filled with wonderful caring people. We often say we are one big family. Our brother Ian is in a fight for his life and needs our help.Due to the debilitating nature of the treatment  it will take months for Ian to resume his normal schedule of gigs. It is his full intention and our greatest wish that he is able to get back to doing what he loves—playing the guitar and making great music. With the support of his family  friends  and our musical community we can do this! It’s our chance to give something back to this very special man who has given us so much over the years.Please join in helping out with any support you can give. PLEASE SHARE THIS ON YOUR PAGE.

Aaron Cook&#x2019;s ExoSym Brace,https://www.gofundme.com/aarons-exosym-brace,7,SLOUGHHOUSE,CA,In April of 2017  my brother  Aaron had a very serious accident while hiking in Yosemite. He suffered a severe  rare type of break of his left ankle.This is a life-altering injury  and is one of the worst types of breaks in the lower extremities.About three months after the accident and multiple surgeries  Aaron slowly started walking again and now  18 months later  he is still only walking. We thank God for that and are grateful  but Aaron is still in a lot of pain on a daily basis and has has lost the ability to perform any dynamic movement.Julie and Aaron recently discovered a device that could change so much for them.It's called the ExoSym  from the Hanger Clinic.  Check it out here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqel7udvEIWith the ExoSym  many people in Aaron’s situation have been able to get back to their pre-injury lifestyle with little pain. People who are experiencing chronic pain and severely limited mobility are now able to be pain free  active and are even running half marathons! We are believing that  Lord willing  Aaron will one day experience less pain and be able to return to doing all the things he loves so much.Aaron & Julie recently found out that Aaron was determined a good candidate for the brace! He submitted the paperwork  videos and pictures of his leg and they said they will be able to help him! This brace will bypass his ankle and allow nearly pain-free weight bearing and dynamic movement. This is wonderful news!!Their insurance does not cover this device so it will be 100% cash pay and will also require a week’s stay to be fitted and receive training on how to use the brace. The cost to obtain the brace is roughly $13 000.00!!They are moving forward in total faith. Let’s join them in that journey and do what we can to help make the brace a reality for Aaron and his future!,10800,13000,14,83,106,541,7

Cancer patient needs vehicle,https://www.gofundme.com/cancer-patient-needs-vehicle,0,RedDeer,AB,"My name is Joy and my daughter  Jo  doesn't want to ask for help so I'm going to do it for her. Her situation is very urgent. Jo is forty-nine and a single mom to a wonderful young man who's currently in his second year of college on his way to becoming a teacher.Jo has been battling health issues for at least eleven years at this time. Her first blood clot scare was when she was working in IT eleven years ago. That wasn’t definitely diagnosed  although all the signs were there and she hasn't been feeling well since then. Her platelets have been low and she's been taking iron for about a decade.Nobody was able to tell her why she was having health issues  even after blood tests and ultra sounds and various other tests. She was always told that everything was normal. Then three years ago  she had a blood clot in her leg which was confirmed by an ultrasound  performed in the emergency department of our local hospital. She didn't display \normal\"" symptoms of a clot. There was no redness or swelling but just a lot of pain  an overall feeling of being unwell  and her own intuition.Shocked but relieved to finally have some sort of diagnosis  she was sent home with two types of blood thinners – Warfarin  and something else that was administered through injection once a day. Sorry  but I don't know the name of it.After about five days of taking her blood thinners as prescribed  she was experiencing intense pain in her right hip. It was bad enough that I drove her to emergency at the hospital myself. We sat for hours  and when she finally saw a doctor  he didn't even examine her. He told her that she had a muscle spasm and she should go home. This was after he was told she was being treated for a blood clot.The next day  her pain was excruciating. We barely got her in the car to take her to the hospital. Again  they made her sit  crying  in a wheelchair for several hours before she was seen by a doctor. When the test results came back  they immediately admitted her and put her into the only available room – a tub room. So she shared her space with a huge bathtub  and she was given a small  uncomfortable cot style bed.They had overdosed her on blood thinners. She was bleeding internally and had an intramuscular hematoma in the muscle of her right leg/buttock. It was the size of a large bakers potato. The pain was caused by the intense pressure placed on the muscle from having such a large foreign mass in the tissue. They didn't want to drain the hematoma because of the danger of infection  so they kept her in the tub room for a week while they stabilized her  and the hematoma basically drained into her leg/system.She almost died.For the first three days or so  we couldn't even talk with her. She was too far out of it to eat or hold a conversation. They kept her on narcotic pain killers and ativan.She was finally released from the hospital about a week after she was first admitted. She went home to her son  a high school student at the time  and their small dog  and tried to pick up on her \""mom duties\"" as best she could.She spent several weeks injecting herself with blood thinners to prevent new clots. It was terrifying for her after what she had been through  but getting a new clot was scarier than the injections she had to give herself daily.The hematoma eventually corrected itself  supposedly draining into her leg/system. This left her with what seemed to be nerve damage in her right leg. The pain has never stopped. She's now been on heavy duty pain killers for three years.A few months after this all happened  while trying to care for her old and ailing dog  she had a misstep on the stairs and fell while carrying her dog. She tried to protect her little dog in the fall and landed badly on her ankle. At first she thought it was a bad sprain and just went to bed. But she was unable to sleep because of the intense pain. Back to the hospital she went  this time with a fractured ankle. The hospital put a splint on it and sent her home.The splint was incredibly painful  so we had to take her back to emerg again. When the nurse saw the splint  she was horrified to see that it hadn’t been done correctly. It was digging into Jo's fracture. No wonder she was in tears. The nurse made her a new splint and sent her home. The new splint was better  but still not great.By this time  her dog was over twelve years old and had become so sick  she almost died. When a vet did blood tests on her (insanely expensive blood tests)  it turned out that her dog was diabetic and needed two shots per day. And because of the fracture in her ankle  Jo was also put back on blood thinners. She became an injection expert  giving herself a needle once a day  and  her dog twice a day.Her dog was also starting to refuse to eat  so Jo sat on the floor with her (with a broken ankle) three times a day  just to help her eat. She ate pretty well with Jo feeding her  and actually seemed to thrive again for a short time.Trying to care for herself  a son  and a sick dog was overwhelming  but she got through it.Finally  shortly before her dog was twelve and a half  she started deteriorating  right when her son was in the middle of writing final exams and graduating high school. It should have been an exciting  happy time  but his mom was still really sick  and now his little doggy was dying.The day he wrote his last ever high school final was the same day we all had to take our dear little dog to the vet and say goodbye to her. It was heartbreaking.Jo still wasn't feeling well. The doctor had blood work done...ultra sounds...mri's...and everything kept coming back \""normal\"". But for some reason  she was still too sick to function. She knew there was something terribly wrong. The health professionals were telling her that she was fine and she needed to get back into life  so she tried. She took an unpleasant part-time job  just to try to \""get on with it\"". She just wasn't able to work more than six hours a week because she was so sick and had no energy. Luckily  her job worked around that. After she'd work a three hour shift  she’d be so tired that she'd have to sleep for two days afterwards to recuperate. That's definitely not the sign of a healthy person with \""nothing wrong with them\"".Getting answers was far from easy  but her doctor tried. She ran test after test. All came back \""normal\"". Finally  in 2017  Jo went into the hospital for surgery and we were all hoping she'd feel better after the issue was fixed. However  that’s not the way it went. She has never bounced back  and hasn't been able to go to work. Her life became extremely lonely as was isolated  spending most of her days in bed sleeping.She kept begging for tests. Then  at the beginning of 2018  her doctor scheduled her for one more mri to try to get to the bottom of the pain in her leg. They were looking at nerves  and they never expected what they found – \""Abnormal bone growth at the bottom of her spine.\"" A.k.a.....cancer.They immediately scheduled her for a bone marrow biopsy. That was a horrible experience for her. Excruciatingly painful. The diagnosis came back as Myelofibrosis  which is \""A serious bone marrow disorder that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells. The result is extensive scarring in the bone marrow  leading to severe anemia  weakness  fatigue and often an enlarged spleen.\""Unfortunately  the sample that was taken from her first biopsy wasn't big enough  and they wanted to be sure of the diagnosis  so they scheduled her for another biopsy. She was terrified...frustrated...tired...fed up.But luckily  the second biopsy went much smoother  and they got a much better sample. They were able to confirm her diagnosis – a rare form of leukemia. Bone Marrow Cancer.Jo was finally put on chemo pills. Ruxolitinib. She will be on chemo pills for the rest of her life. She's thankful for them  but they leave her exhausted  weak  and struggling to function. There's no hope of her ever being cancer free  or going into remission. Just cancer and pain management for the rest of her life.In the summer of 2018  just a couple months ago  she also had an appointment in Calgary at the Foothills hospital with a bone marrow transplant surgeon. We all went together – Jo  her son  my other daughter  and me.The news from the surgeon was not good.1/3 of patients die from the transplant itself.1/3 of patients survive the transplant  but go on to live with \""Donor vs. Host Disease\"" for the rest of their lives  and that isn't pretty.1/3 of the patients get to leave the hospital and try to get on with life.The transplant process can cause extreme organ damage – even brain damage – so that's the chance you take. In Jo's case  her odds are less than 1/3 that she'll survive the transplant. Her organs are already extremely damaged from the cancer itself  and her condition causes scar tissue in her bones. So even if they give her chemo and radiation to kill the marrow she has left in her bones  once they inject her with new  healthy stem cells  they won't have anything to \""grab onto\"". There's too much scar tissue. So we were basically warned that her chances of surviving a transplant are very low.It was an overwhelming experience. We all agreed together that her best bet is to live on chemo  with the cancer  and hope for the best.She still spends most of her time in bed  sleeping  but at least she's here.Her son has almost three years of college/university left and she needs to see him through it. He still needs his mom.Now for the reason for this gofundme. Jo needs a reliable vehicle to get to her many doctors appointments – several each month. She has appointments with her GP every month as well as appointments with her Oncologist  ongoing blood tests  and ultra sounds  and she needs decent transportation.She bought a car about three years ago with my help  but within about three months of owning it  we had to replace the transmission. It's not an extremely old car. It's a 2008 with only about 140 000 km on it  but it's been an ongoing problem. She bought a new battery for it  new brakes  new oil....all the standard stuff  but here we are again. It's back in the shop  needing another new transmission.My daughter is not hard on her vehicles. She doesn't even do any highway driving because she’s always worried about this car breaking down.None of us can afford to get her another vehicle  so we're reaching out for help. I’m a senior citizen  retired from a government job  with my own health issues  now working only a few hours a week. I’ve been doing all I can for Jo and her son  but I can’t buy her a new transmission  or a different vehicle. We’ve decided it would make more sense for her to get a reliable vehicle and scrap this one. She’s not asking for a lot....nothing brand new...just a reliable vehicle to get her to her appointments safely. She’ll need it as soon as possible.If you're not able to donate money  please just share this gofundme link as much as you can.We appreciate your help more than you'll ever know.""",1935,10000,19,19,21,67,7

Insulin drive,https://www.gofundme.com/insulin-drive,0,LASVEGAS,NV,My name is Irish Kinsella. I work 3 gigs and average 60-70 hours a week. Have 1 day a week to see my kids. Pay child support and all the other life supporting bills. Summer saw some setbacks monetarily (health  car issues  reduction in income due to reduced hours) but I'm climbing back up. What I'm asking for is help securing my insulin until I can get back in line. I am not insured  but I do have someone I pay for insulin. I have been dealing with him for almost 2 years. My insulin runs about $700 for 2 months worth. That's 2 different insulins Novolog and Levimir. These would normally cost me $1700 including premiums and deductibles. So  I consider myself lucky to have found my insulin connection at the prices I pay.  I dont have the funds currently to pay him and dont want him to sell elsewhere and leave me without a means of getting insulin anymore.  I owe him $340 from the last batch and $700 for the next batch  he has worked with me on paying for a while now  but that time is up.  Many things can be put off in life. This isnt one of them.  ￼ Anything would be appreciated  I've been here for other reasons not life threatening and have found help. I am hoping to find help again.  Anything in excess of the stated goal will go towards more insulin. Thank you all in advance.,625,1000,7,63,10,125,7

Gender dysphoria is the distress a person experiences as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth not being the gender they identify with.For me  a lot of my dysphoria is based around my chest. I have a very large feminine shaped chest  so being able to remove my distress would be beneficial to not only my physical health but my mental health.What is top surgery? Top surgery for trans men is known by the medical term of double incision mastectomy. It is the complete removal of the breast tissue and glands to give a flatter and more masculine appearance. This surgery can and will change my life.The total cost for the surgery will be about $6500 with all the fees etc. and any donations can and will help! With this GoFundMe I hope to finally have a way to be comfortable in my own skin and make everyday life easier and happier.Thank you for reading!""",745,6500,9,11,21,188,7

Saving  Amir&#x2019;s life,https://www.gofundme.com/saving-amirs-life,9,HALLANDALE,FL,In 2015 Amir  was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  a cancer of the lymphatic system. In 2016  after 6 months of Chemotherapy  he was pronounced to have reached a full remission. About five months ago after feeling some sharp pain in his chest and visiting the hospital  he came to realize that his cancer was back. He was informed that this is a result of a few cancer cells not being entirely killed off the first time around and thus regenerating over time.Luckily when Amir was initially diagnosed two years back  his insurance  the hospital’s financial aid department and his family covered the costs of the treatment. This time around things are different. The family is in a very tight spot financially  Amir’s new insurance will not cover all of the medical costs and the remaining balance of the cost of treatment has to be covered by his family. He has already undergone 4 Chemotherapy treatmentin the last few months. This time around  to ensure that any leftover Cancer Cells don’t survive like last time  Amir will undergo a Stem Cell Transplant. The purpose of the transplant is to kill all remaining Cancer Cells in his body.  The transplant process will begin by administering a very high dosage of Chemo for several days killing all remaining Cancer Cells(unfortunately the high dosage of Chemo will also destroy all his good cells including his immune system)  then he is injected with the Stem Cells extracted from him and frozen prior to the high dosage of Chemotherapy.Last month Amir underwent his Stem Cell extraction and harvesting. Amir will be admitted to the hospital on first of October to start receiving high doses of chemotherapy  preparing him for the Stem Cell transplant. Without coverage this procedure is very expensive  sometimes reaching in the $800 000 range. The major downside to this procedure is that while his immune system is down he will have to be hospitalized for about six to eight weeks. The only way he will be able to have visitors is if their clothing is regulated  including gloves and masks. Once he is released from the hospital the recovery of his immune system could take anywhere from 4 months to a year. He will have to be isolated at home until his immune system is strong again.Once Amir returns home from the hospital his room will have to be modified  in which there cannot be a carpet or any kind of surface that can harvest bacteria. He will not be able to be around large crowds. His white blood cell count will have to be closely monitored at all times. A specialized air filter on all air conditioning in the house will have to be installed. A specialized air ionizer / filter will have to be placed in his room to refresh the air in the room. He will not be able to eat out anywhere and his diet will have to be heavily regulated. Microbes that we never have to worry about in our everyday lives will suddenly become dangerous in his day to day. Amir is going to have to take the next 2 semesters off from the university in order to get through this and every 3 weeks for the next year and a half he will have to receive immune system booster.As Amir and his family are tackling this tremendous test of will and strength  they are faced with financial ruin due to the excessive hospital and treatment cost.  Not being able to pay for his share of the treatment cost the care giver might refuse his treatment until the amount owed is paid. Your donations will go towards all pending and future medical costs  medical supplies  as well as the general mountain of costs that his family faces regarding the especial accommodations for Amir for at least one year after the transplant.Amir and his family would be extremely grateful for your donation  and if you would share this page with anyone and everyone you think may be able to help.Thank you and God Bless ,4717,10000,9,47,103,899,7
Help Us Cure Bonnie&apos;s Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/bonnies-cancerfund,1,COTTAGEGROVE,OR,"Bonnie's Ewing's Sarcoma has metastasized in her lungs. FROM THE BEGINNINGWhen you are a young adult attending college  working full time  and chasing your rambunctious but highly intelligent son through a bedtime routine  the last thing you expect is to end up in the ER in terrible pain. You especially do not expect to hear that the pain isn’t something simple to remedy  but in fact  is a softball sized tumor growing on your ribs. That’s exactly the challenge life served Bonnie.So  the mass was removed in one of the most painful surgeries a person can undergo. The Dr. sat across from Bonnie’s mother and partner with news to deliver that makes time stand still and your breath stop. “It’s definitely CANCER.”  Soon thereafter Bonnie began a rigorous regimen of inpatient chemotherapy which included a 5 day hospital stay (due to the intensity of the chemo) every 4th week. Between her inpatient chemotherapy visits  she was also receiving outpatient infusions every other week. Throw in another rib resection surgery mid-year and several hospital admissions for neutropenic shock  and Bonnie spent more of 2017 in the hospital than she spent time at home with her family.Happy news came early 2018. She had finally completed her year of chemo treatments and was given the \all clear\"" when her scans came back free of any indication of cancer. Bonnie could finally move forward with plans they had to relocate to Oregon  continue school and work  meet new people and enjoy time with family. DISCOURAGING NEWSWhen Bonnie went to the oncologist this September for her first routine 6 month follow up  the CT scans showed spots on lungs that were not there in February. After a biopsy a week later  it was confirmed that her cancer has returned. The new prognosis was originally presented as a pretty bleak scenario. Bonnie was offered limited treatment options that typically only show benefit in 30%- 50% of patients treated. Bonnie's oncologist was optimistic that if they could find the right treatment it could possibly stop the cell regeneration and maybe even send the cancer into remission. This suggestion offered her hope  until it was coupled with the phrases ”to hope for 10 years would be optimistic\"" and that anything currently available would still result in \""just biding time\"". We felt defeated  but did not give up. A SECOND OPINIONThis is where we would appreciate your help!We reached out to Cancer Treatment Center of America for a second opinion and their attitude from the very beginning was one of optimism. They assessed the situation and believe that all treatment should be designed to cure and not just bide time. They are ready to review her individual diagnosis and create a treatment plan tailored to her specific cancer. Although Bonnie's insurance does cover some of the costs of treatment  she is seeking funding  to compensate for loss of income she will suffer while unable to work  loss of income her loved ones and support team may experience when helping her to treatments  reoccurring insurance premiums to maintain her health care coverage  insurance co-pays  deductibles  travel expenses to the out-of-state treatment facilities  additional childcare costs for her 7 year old son so he can attend daycare while she receives treatments  and any of the many other unforeseeable costs associated with such a diagnosis.As with any cancer diagnosis  time is of the essence. Initial funding will be put to use as early as this week when Bonnie heads to her first consultation with Cancer Treatment Center of America. The need for funding will be a continuous one as we learned in 2017  and every cent or every \""share\"" of this GoFundMe link   and Bonnie's story  is appreciated more than you can imagine.We understand not everyone will be able to donate  and that is okay! If you are unable to donate  but would still like to help  here's some suggestions:- Spread the word! Share this story with everyone you know!- Shoot her a nice text and let her know she is in your thoughts- Post pictures and stories here of how you know Bonnie and how she has touched your life- Visit her website for stories of her journey-Join her Facebook Group for regular updates and uploads- Check back here often for updates""",14375,50000,16,29,219,1000,6
Wife Never Had A Chance,https://www.gofundme.com/wife-never-had-a-chance,7,FOLSOM,CA,Ever since my wife Ash was young  she has suffered a lot from the people who were supposed to love her. Unfortunately this trauma manifested later on in her life in Borderline Personality Disorder  Panic Disorder  CPTSD and Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome  as well as Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She is incredibly brave as well as smart - she started getting help for her mental illnesses as soon as they appeared. But life and stigma keep you from living your fullest life. And it would be a very  VERY long time before she could get the help she deserved.I watched my wife  through the course of ten years  go from a funny  gentle  irreverent best friend to a dark  silent explosive barrel. Things would be my fault. Then she’d cry hysterically about the constant pain and start self-injuring because she couldn’t handle the pain and the abandonment that came with it. Unfortunately she is alone  and I’ve been both target and savior for her. And anyone who has had carer’s fatigue knows that she isn’t the only victim of her illnesses. We have exhausted all our funds  constantly borrowing money from the few people we know - but every waking moment is a torment for Ash. It’s been years of getting brushed off and passed around by doctors who didn’t care or want to help. We just need some help for the moment with tests and co-pays and treatments and inpatient therapy and treatment and obscene amounts of supplements by a man who charged $75 every 15 minuets. Hair tests and blood tests and urine and stools... never enough money and Ash feels completely responsible. She had suicidal behavior when it was “only” Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome because she was in such pain and no one believed her. The irony is that the number one cause of death from Fibromyalgia is suicide... because no one believes you.,320,2500,15,13,5,23,5
Malrotation Surgery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/malrotation-surgery-fund,6,VERMILION,OH,"Most of the people that know me know that I was born with a congenital birth defect called Intestinal Malrotation.  This condition causes the intestines to form wrong and not rotate correctly  leading to bowel obstructions and a slew of other issues. I have had multiple surgeries for this in my 28 years  but am still left with intermittent bowel obstructions  chronic pain  nausea and vomiting. These issues have only gotten worse and are now making it near impossible to continue working  let alone live a happy life.I decided to pursue a potential surgery with the head of Intestinal Transplant at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus who has developed a new \self transplant\"" surgery that actually fixes the Malrotation. I have not only been approved for surgery  but have been told how in need I am of it. My duodenum is flipped over onto itself causing intermittent obstructions and severe pain  my colon is severely stretched out and damaged (I require a bowel resection)  and one of my major arteries is being compressed by one of the veins in my abdomen. At any time I could lose part of my bowel or my life. I am blessed to have insurance that will cover the surgery  but am not eligible for any type of disability through work because I work part-time. I am asking for help covering the bills and any unforseen expenses during the potential 6 months that I may need off of work. I could be scheduled for surgery within the next 6 weeks.This could be an answer to a life time of prayers and any support you can give me would be so appreciated. God bless!""",1465,10000,6,15,25,397,7

Dallas Needs Medical Help,https://www.gofundme.com/dallas-needs-medical-help,6,WEATHERFORD,TX,Ok so as most of you know  I had a back injury at the beginning of the year. I had a disc in my lower back bulge onto my sciatic nerve that caused me to suffer chronic pain for months. I have been out of work for 6 months and I get paid half of my salary from the previous year. I had my surgery in august after months of doctors visits to hopefully correct the problem but it does not appear that I am out of the woods yet. My Benefits went dormant at my job once my short term disability transitioned to long term disability in August. Since my benefits went dormant  I lost my health insurance. My surgery was not yet paid for by United and now I have a 10k bill. I also still have some smaller procedures and physical therapy to do before I am fully healed or at least on the downhill slope to wellness.I am creating this because I need COBRA insurance. I know it is expensive but COBRA will pick up where United left off with my company and they will cover everything 100% since my deductibles have all been met. COBRA will cost me roughly 464 Dollars a month. I only need it for 3 months and then I will switch insurance because my deductibles will reset. COBRA will pay my surgery bill from August and the future Steroid Injections I will need as well as my medications and physical therapy and the MRI I will need in 6 weeks. 1500 Dollars should cover just that one bill fine for the rest of the year and any other medical expenses I have currently. My normal 50% salary will sustain my everyday living and food and other bills. This is my first GoFundMe. Ive never really thought that I needed it but I think this situation has brought up a good reason.I cant currently work a real job. I cant lift or bend or twist or really even walk long. Because of that  finding any extra money has been very difficult. Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read my woes. Thank you for any who donate. 30 Has been a rough year for me but I will persevere and I will get through this.,485,1500,13,32,8,43,7
"Sam Miller Fell Down, Went Boom",https://www.gofundme.com/sam-miller-fell-down-went-boom,0,ATLANTICBEACH,FL,What happened to me. (as told by Sam)I was on a dark street in Jepara Central Java getting coffee at a little warung when I stepped off the sidewalk into a sewer they were constructing. I stepped into thin air and fell about 5 feet and smashed my left shin into the concrete. I was wearing jeans and sandals. I continued to fall into the dry bottom of the sewer another 3 feet. My jeans were soaked with blood and I was sure I had broken my leg. I did not. I had a very nasty laceration/impact wound from the fall. An area about the size of a silver dollar swelled up like a donut bleeding profusely. I got back to my hotel on my scooter and washed the wound out went to the convenience store and got bandages to dress the wound. Midday the following day I caught the bus back to Bali. It was a 20 hour bus trip. By the time I got to Bali things were going wrong I tried to get to my usual doctor but he was closed. Finally 2 days later  I got to him. By this time I was starting to feel really sick. He put on antibiotics and dressed the wound and instructed me to change the dressing daily. Two days later my wound looked horrible and dark and began to smell really bad. I went back to the doctor and he told me gangrene was starting. He told me I had to go immediately to the hospital.My friends Kris and Dini got me to the hospital and the staff started assessing my situation. By this time I had a number of things going wrong. My kidneys and liver were in bad shape trying to keep up with the infection and somehow I had developed a heart beat  irregularity. They had to even out my heartbeat before they could operate.  They were able to do that with medication. They did something similar to assist my kidneys and liver but I was too out of it to understand what they were doing. They operated on my 3rd day in the hospital. They did a spinal anesthesia and knocked me out from the waist down. I was awake during the operation but cloaked so I could not watch.The doctors opened up a 9 inch incision along my left tibia and by combination of vacuum and scalpel removed the necrotic tissue. They continued to slam me with meds as I recovered  and it was a couple days later when they finally were to change the dressing on the wound. I was under the impression they had cut me open and stitched me closed. This was not the case. When they removed my bandages my wound was wide open and I could see my tibia and all the debrided flesh. It was terrifying! This was my lowest moment. Trying to digest all this was outside my comprehension.The doctor had done nothing to prepare me. Lot to process. Breathe in. Breath out. Try to stay calm. I managed. My friends Kris and Dini were a great help and support. Very grateful for their presence.After operation I still I felt really bad my urine was super scary dark and I was in much pain. They determined I my infection was resisting the antibiotic. This started a new round of blood work and change in therapy. The lab results came back they changed therapy and I  started feeling much better. The next time they changed the dressing I was able to accept that they were doing the right thing and even if I might be scarred badly I would at least have my leg  and the doctor reported that the healing process was beginning in earnest. So my mood buoyedSo more meds more rest and finally another change of the bandages  more ownership of the strange wound on my leg and a little more acceptance emotionally of my situation.  I was released after 10 days.  Now recovering at my studio apartment. I still have multiple visits to the hospital ahead of me and I am very limited in mobility. I have friends to help. The damage for all this is looking like USD $10 000 Which is gonna really hurt just a time when I was developing some good new business here in Indo. I want to push on with that business. I don’t want to give up. I don’t see what is really to gain by coming back to USA now that I seem to be mostly out of harm's way.Trying to gather funds from recent business stuff and I’m selling my motorcycle but it’s a damn stretch. Nobody could feel more stupid about not having at least travel insurance. You get away with stuff for so long and you get complacent. I have beat myself up plenty the Iast 3 weeks I  just have make steps to remedy that particular human failing among my many others.So that's what happened.  Thank you for your help,10925,10000,23,109,55,127,7
Friends of Amanda,https://www.gofundme.com/friends-of-amanda,4,STAMFORD,CT,If you know Amanda  you know one of the most amazing parts about her is her heart and strength. She is a wonderful mother  a wife  she works  and maintains many friendships with people who love her immensely.  I’m reaching out because I know she needs our help. Amanda required a kidney transplant in 2004  which was lovingly donated by her father.  Amanda has end stage renal disease  Stage 4 of 5. Her kidney function deteriorated after multiple kidney rejections in 2015. Due to this  she suffers from  low energy  anemia  high blood pressure  feet and leg cramping on a regular basis all while working and running her household.  Amanda still has her donated kidney  but the function is not at 100% nor will it ever be. If she doesn’t have access to her drugs her body will reject her kidney and she will either have to go on dialysis or suffer kidney failure. Amanda’s medication deductibles are $10 000 and in September it reset.  She is on a tier 4 drug in which insurance will only allow a 31 day supply at a time.  This drug alone is over $1000 FOR A MONTH SUPPLY prior to her deductible being reached.  Amanda’s 7 other mandatory medications are over $150 per month until her $10 000 deductible is reached. She is doing all she can do. Tries to get coupons for the meds  juggles bills to make ends meet  restricts her and her family’s life to save whatever she can and she is struggling. Please understand it is the hardest thing for her to ask for help. So I am asking for her. Any little bit helps. I appreciate anything you can do to help my friend.,4856,10000,18,49,66,226,7

Loss of income coupled with insurance premiums   car payment and medical bills will soon be overwhelming. Mom has always been a giver   always wanting to help other people in need and now it's my turn to help her.I would ask you to please give as you can and please share with your friends on social media.  God bless.,510,8000,7,6,5,64,7

Rally for Robbie King,https://www.gofundme.com/rally-for-robbie-king,9,ALLEGANY,NY,When Rob and I were married 11 years ago  we never suspected our biggest challenge would be trying to keep Rob alive! Ten and a half years ago  Rob was diagnosed with degenerative heart disease. As his health deteriorated  he was no longer able to work as a heavy equipment operator for the Department of Public Works  and was forced to go on permanent disability.Rob is currently awaiting evaluation for a heart transplant at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester  where he has spent the majority of the last six months as an inpatient.  For over nine years in Buffalo  and the last year and a half in Rochester  he has endured treatments and procedures that include 27 angiograms  15 stents and double bypass  two open heart surgeries  and multiple right heart catheter studies.These frequent and extended trips to Buffalo (150 miles roundtrip) and Rochester (250 miles roundtrip) have added to a financial burden we might never recover from. In addition to an uninsured home mortgage on a house in my husband's name only  and car payments on our two 2005 vehicles  the extra expense of unanticipated gas  food  and lodging has drained our accounts  our cards  and way beyond.Full disability forced me to leave my chosen vocation of nursing 24 years ago.  I was able to supplement our income over the years with a part time reflexology practice  but my own health issues  and the need to be available for Rob's appointments  has made even that impossible for the last several years.We have been blessed enormously by our families and close friends  who have gone above and beyond with spiritual  physical  and financial support.  It's hard to admit we can't make it on our own right now.  I'm asking you not for a HANDOUT  but for a hand UP to help us get through this rough time.  We appreciate your support  and thank you for your generous donations!10/4/2018 update:  Rob has been in Strong for one full month.  He has developed renal failure.  Currently he is in the ICU and I have been going up to Rochester 2 to 4 times a week.  With winter coming I will need to stay up there.,1905,100000,13,2,23,126,7
My chance for healing from Lyme,https://www.gofundme.com/my-chance-for-healing-from-lyme,7,PARADISE,CA,9 years ago I contracted lyme disease from a tick bite. I was not diagnosed right away so I saw over twenty doctors and specialists to find out why I had gotten so sick. After finding out that it was lyme disease  I found a doctor that would treat me. I took antibiotics for five years and had a picc line for seven months out of that time. I was on a lot of other medications to help with symptoms while I was going through the antibiotic treatment. A little over three years ago I got pregnant with my first child. The antibiotics had not cured me so I stopped them and all of the other medications. I didn't want to be taking medications while pregnant. Now a single mom I'm still sick and doing my best to raise my son and take care of my heath. I recently found a natural lyme protocol. I'm asking for help to pay for the supplements so I can get well and better take care of myself and my son. I'm only getting sicker so I need to start these supplements as soon as possible.,575,5000,11,12,9,63,7

Support for Gordon Kirby,https://www.gofundme.com/t74cd3-support-for-gordon,7,NORMANPARK,GA,On September 11  2017 Gordon Kirby suffered a stroke. After a lengthy stay in the hospital and with physical therapy after he was discharged he regained his mobility. While we are extremely thankful for this improvement  he still suffers from Aphasia which is a communication disorder that impairs his ability to process language. While this does not affect intelligence  it does hinder him when processing speech  like a brain-fog so to speak. He understands what is being said to him but is unable to respond with more than simple answers and it takes him longer to process his thoughts. When trying to write  the letters get jumbled up so communicating in this way is also hindered. We have found a treatment center that has had a great success rate in helping stroke patients recover from this debilitating side effect from having a stroke. The Institute of Neurological Recovery  in Boca Raton  Florida  has developed an innovative way of injecting a drug called Etanercept into a patient’s spinal fluid. The drug is currently licensed to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis but Dr. Tobinick discovered its positive effects for stroke patients. This pioneering treatment is not a cure for a stroke but has given many patients their speech and communication skills back. The treatment wakes up parts of the brain surrounded by the damaged area. Many patients start to experience positive effects from the Etanercept injection within a few minutes while benefits can continue to increase for several weeks afterward. Results are very individual to each patient as the severity of the damaged tissue in the brain varies from person to person. Some of the improvements from the injection are: speech  swallowing  memory  concentration  taste  vision  hearing  mobility  recovery of areas of sensation loss  improvements in cognition  the list goes on and on! The neurons in the brain don’t die but instead  current research shows that they go dormant. This treatment for neurological disorders reopens access to areas blocked off by the stroke even years after the stroke has happened. Gordon has already had his medical records reviewed by the doctors at The Institute of Neurological Recovery and after a lengthy interview and consultation  they believe that he is a viable candidate for the Perispinal Etanercept treatment and they have accepted him as a patient.  We have been made aware that depending on the outcome of the first spinal injection  he may need a second injection a few weeks later. Gordon does not have insurance but even if he did  this treatment is not covered by insurance. It is expensive and although Gordon has been trying to come up with the money  he truly needs help to pay for the treatment. He has done so much for everyone he knows and now it is time for us to return the favor. We’re hoping that this GoFundMe account will generate the money he needs for his treatment from those that know and love him and also those that don’t know him but that are looking for a worthy cause to support. The first injection is $7 600 and the second will be the same amount  so we are hoping this GoFundMe page will generate the funds he needs to have the treatment done as soon as possible. The doctors have said that the sooner the treatment is given after the stroke  the better the results tend to be. While they have had outstanding results  they say that 1 in 5 patients it will not work for. Because Gordon’s stroke was fairly recently  he is an excellent candidate and they expect he will see some improvement. We love Gordon and any improvement over his current condition  the inability to communicate with his brothers  family  and friends  will be better than his current state. There is a summary of costs below as well as a link to the interview that originally aired on 60 Minutes back in April of 2014. The interview explains the treatment process and how the Etanercept is injected into the patient. It also shows the treatment being done to an actual patient. This video has given us hope  and given Gordon hope  that life can return to a new normal for him and for everyone that loves him. Please watch the video  it is amazing! It’s 25 minutes long but totally worth your time to view it.Thank you so much for taking the time to read our letter and consider whether our cause is something you would like to support.  Small amounts add up so we are ever so grateful for anything you feel led to donate on Gordon’s behalf.  Link to 60 Minutes interview:  http://www.strokebreakthrough.com/ Summary of costs:Treatment 1:         $7 600.00Treatment 2:         $7 600.00Travel (Gas/Hotel)    $400.00TOTAL:                $15 600.00,2235,15600,10,14,27,226,7

Help get Michael back on his feet,https://www.gofundme.com/help-get-michael-back-on-his-feet,9,AUBURN,NY,On Monday  October 1st Michael suffered a stroke. He was transferred to Strong Memorial Hospital where he was recovering and making great progress. Unfortunately on Wednesday October 3rd things quickly took a turn for the worse. Michael was stumbling in his room  but quickly found by staff and upon further evaluation from the medical team it was determined that he was again suffering from another stroke. The pressure in his brain was building and emergency brain surgery was needed. At this time Mike is being kept under sedation and is on a ventilator to allow him to rest as much as possible during this critical 48 hours. He is fighting even through a fever  high blood pressure and swelling of the brain. Michael has a long road ahead of him. Where  on Wednesday  we thought that rehab was in the near future  those plans have been put on hold.  Even though Michael has insurance  the costs are quickly adding up. With the help of his team  we have determined that the out of pocket expenses for his care in the hospital  his rehabilitation  the care of his daughter and travel and food expenses for his family are going to quickly deplete savings.,5100,6500,9,78,67,622,7
Palomas Dental Procedure,https://www.gofundme.com/palomas-dental-procedure,8,BROOKLYN,NY,Paloma Zapata is one of the most amazingly kind  patient  loving  and humble people I have ever met. Even if you have only met her once I know that you could attest to these qualities as well. I am so thankful to have her in my life.

Paloma is in need of a dental operation due to a childhood accident and insurance only covers a basic solution which isn't the right fit for her.

She is undergoing painful physical and occupational rehab. Her right foot is broken. She had surgery of the first metatarsal bone  contusion of encounter with ankle and heal involvement. She is not able to walk and needs several more surgeries on both hand and foot along with months of rehabilitation.

The driver of the vehicle was speeding extensively in the shopping plaza which has a 10 MPH speed limit. He has 36 traffic citations of reckless driving infractions. He was driving with a suspended license. He had no car insurance. He failed to yield to a pedestrian who always has the right of way. He had total disregard for a human life.

Open Heart Surgery For Jonathan,https://www.gofundme.com/silvaj,9,CHULAVISTA,CA,On Wednesday morning October 3rd I had an Transient Ischemic Attack (mini stroke) while at work. I didn’t think much about it and went on with my day. Later that night at the gym Caroline noticed the left side of my face had gone numb. She asked me to smile and there was no response . Without hesitation she rushed me to the Emergency Room where I got treated for a mini stroke. We weren’t sure what was happening let alone why. The doctor was puzzled that a healthy  strong  young man could be having symptoms of stroke  so he had me take an EKG  CAT scan and had blood work done. He also wanted to keep me over night for the next two days. But we don’t have insurance and declined; taking the risk that I would be okay. The next morning October 4th we drove to Tijuana to speak with a cardiologist who gave him an other EKG test following up with an echocardiogram. The echo showed that the heart murmur I was born with was more serious than I ever believed. In fact when I tried to apply for the U.S. Marine Corps they did an echo on me  found I wasn’t suitable for the military and dismissed me; never advising me to seek care. So here we are sitting in an office realizing that me heart is two times thicker than an average healthy heart  over worked and calcified. Thus not allowing blood to properly pump to my whole body  which was the cause for my mini stoke. So not only did I have a stoke last night  now we find out that I need to have open heart surgery to get a heart valve transplant. Now remember how we didn’t have insurance to stay at the hospital over night  well we definitely don’t have the money to afford this surgery. And this is an operation that needs to happen. The doctor recommended we make this account to raise money  he said we can’t wait for the surgery to be done and we need to act quick. So I’m asking all my friends and family to help. Honestly even if it is $2 dollars and sharing this post. The average cost of a heart valve replacement is $200 000 in the U.S. but we are debating having to operation done in Tijuana at a fraction of the cost  anywhere between $18 000-$25 000 depending on what the heart surgeon sees. Anything helps  the money raised will be used to pay for the operation  emergency room  medication  doctor visits  testing and after care costs.We are doing anything and everything to raise and save money  to save my life. Please help spread the word  and if you would help us by donating money we would be eternally grateful. Thank you all.Feel free to message me with any questions. I'll be posting updates on Instagram @bartusch. Thank you all. ￼￼￼￼￼￼,20974,30000,33,70,214,260,7
Life During and After Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/life-during-and-after-cancer,6,BRYAN,TX,My older brother David has been through a lot in the past year or so.  In August 2017  he lost his wife Beth unexpectedly.  He was living in Tennessee with his wife's family  having just found a job. After Beth passed away  he decided to move back to Maryland to try and save his house.  In June of 2018  he lost his home to foreclosure.  On June 7  2018 he was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer.  He has endured two rounds of chemo and radiation.   His oncologist has advised that the cancer has not spread and he is eligible for thoracic surgery.  This surgery will not take place until sometime in December of this year.  The surgery is very invasive  it entails removed part if not all of his esophagus and using his stomach to make a new one.  Because of the area of the surgery  it makes for a very delicate and complicated procedure.  He is looking at a minimum stay for recovery of 7 - 10 days in the hospital.  At this point there is no  way to now how long his recovery will be.  He will not be able to work and obviously still has to pay rent and other bills.  I am asking for your compassion and help at this time.  He is only 61 years old and I hope and pray that he has many more years to live.  Please help me in helping my brother survive during and after his surgery by providing a donation.  May God Bless you all.,255,2000,4,13,7,158,7
Helping Dad,https://www.gofundme.com/qe6e9-helping-dad,6,MCPHERSON,KS,This is my Dad  my hero. Over 30 years ago he had a stroke caused by a bleed in his brain  the doctors didn't think he'd survive. But HE did. He was paralyzed on his right side  he had to learn to walk again. He's had a couple smaller strokes since  thankfully they only caused slurred speach. His right side has never been the same. He uses a walker to get around. He needs to have knee replacement surgery on both knees. His left knee is worse than his right knee  he's pretty much walking bone on bone. My dad needs to have at least 10 teeth extracted before he has surgery. He was scheduled to have surgery this week but because of his dental issue he has had to postpone surgery. Money is a huge factor at this time. Dad is retired and lives just off his social security. Praying to raise enough money for him to get to the dentist so that he can have his knee surgery. If surgery doesn't happen soon  we are looking at him possibly needing a wheelchair.

Justine Strong,https://www.gofundme.com/JustineStrong,1,SAUGUS,MA,As some of you may know  Justine Plourde  a loving wife  mother  sister  auntie  and friend was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Breast Cancer. Back in May of 2018  Justine tripped and fell at work. Justine began to receive routine physical therapy due to her fall but Justine’s condition continued to progressively worsen. At a follow up appointment due to the painful spasms from her fall  Justine located a lump in her breast that she thought was a strained muscle due to her fall. Her doctor decided to schedule a routine mammogram  which Justine had not previously had because of her age. At this appointment  Justine also received an ultrasound and biopsy due to the mass that was located. Two days after the appointment  Justine was admitted to the emergency room with a fractured back. Justine was transferred to Mass General Hospital to see a specialist immediately. Five days later Justine’s family received results that they believed the cancer might have spread which may have led to the fracture in her back from a minor fall.Over the next month  Justine went through multiple procedures  tests  and biopsies  which confirmed that the cancer had in fact spread to Justine’s bones. Justine has had undergone some intense treatments of radiation already. These treatments were daily and on multiple different areas. The treatments have weaken her immune system and lowered her energy level. Justine was not able to care for herself  so her husband JR also needed to take a leave from work to assist caring for her and their two young children.Justine is hopeful that she will be able to return to work eventually  however  there is no cure for her diagnosis. Justine will need to be on medicine for the rest of her life and her treatments will change as needed depending on which treatments will react well for her. This will require future leaves of absence from work for her and her husband.Justine is one of the strongest  most selfless people I have ever known and is always there to give her love and support to anyone who needs it. She is cheerful  loving  and unbelievably strong and always puts her friends and family before herself. Now it is time that we send back some of that love and support to Justine. What is most important is that we surround Justine with all the love and support we can so she can focus her energy on the fight ahead. The Go Fund Me page is intended to help her pay for medical expenses as she goes through the process of fighting breast cancer. We are reaching out to friends and family to support Justine and her family with the financial burden of medical bills and daily costs of living. There is no amount to small and every donation is greatly appreciated by her family. We thank you in advance for your support.Remember money is not the only thing you can offer. Post on her Facebook page or on this gofundme page with words of love and encouragement and pictures and remind her how strong she really is!

Steven&apos;s new heart,https://www.gofundme.com/steven039s-new-heart,9,ONEIDA,TN,In 2008  at age 17  Steven was involved in an accident that would forever change his life. He suffered blunt force trauma to the chest which broke his sternum and impaled his heart. He was put into a medically induced coma for 3 weeks and an internal defibrillator was placed. Recently Steven's health has declined. A few weeks ago while driving home  Steven passed out at the wheel of his vehicle due to a shock from his defibrillator. Which has made him unable to safely drive.    After a trip to Vanderbilt on 09/26/18-09/28/18 it was determined that Steven is a candidate for a heart transplant and he was placed on the UNOS transplant list. Steven also will be returning in a few weeks to have a LVAD placed. Which will help decrease the workload of his heart until a donor heart can be found. Steven currently resides in Clinton  TN which is 3 hours from Nashville where Vanderbilt is located. Him and his fiance  who is currently expecting  will have to stay in Nashville for 4-6 weeks after the LVAD placement for recovery and therapy. They also have a 4 year old daughter at home. At this time Christian  his fiance  is the sole provider for their family. Where he can no longer drive  she is his primary mode of transportation. Between caring for their little one  growing another little one  working full time  and caring for Steven the financial burden is growing and will continue to grow throughout his transplant journey. Any donation that you can make would be very much appreciated. I will continue to update as they go along. I have permission from both Steven and Christian to start this GoFundMe and it will be solely for their medical expenses and travel. Thoughts and prayers are appreciated as well  God bless!,5781,10000,6,58,63,1000,7
2000,https://www.gofundme.com/hm5xw-2000,8,JERSEYCITY,NJ,Hello kind people This page was set up for a remarkable family who has suffered tremendous loss.These two amazing teenage sisters and baby sister of 5 years of age... suffered the untimely death of their beautiful mother almost a year ago this Oct. This did not stop them  nor their father from plowing through. They moved and started new schools  always looking out for one another.  The transition would be hard for most people of means ...theirs are of meager means and yet they persevered.  The girls working hard in school very conscientious and achieving.  With some turmoil of moving to different households out of relatives  they found a place  of their own. The family moved some belongings in over the summer… the rest was on a pickup truck driven by Dad with Charleilys and baby sister Charkeilys heading from the Bronx  NY to Rochester  NY. on Labor Day.They would not make it. There was a horrific crash on route17 in Monticello  NY  which resulted in the death of Charkeilys their adored baby. It should be noted that seat belts were worn. Charleilys and her father suffered extensive injuries. Charleilys remains in the hospital recovering. Dad is out now and piecing his family back together.Charmelys who is 16 has been a Rock!  She has taken on more responsibility than any 16 year old should ever have to and is doing so with unmatched courage and strength... not many adults could manage as well as she.We (the girls’ school families) would like to raise enough money to furnish their next home and get reliable transportation. They are currently doubled up with Grandma in small quarters as they wait for Charleilys to recover and be discharged.Please  please  please give as much as you can and then some more.This family needs a break from despair. They are one the most loving  humble and hard working families. Dad was employed but due to his injuries it is uncertain of when he will be able to work.Thank you for your kind attention in reading their story and anticipated support.With Gratitude and loveFrom Susan and Gloria And their school families,760,2000,25,38,17,36,7

In the next few days  through a series of rapid appointments  we learned that he has throat cancer. Due to the daily radiation  weekly chemo  and feeding tube  they don’t believe he will be able to talk  never mind work.

Not only is she my mom  she's my best friend in this world. I could always depend on her to put a smile on my face. Through every hardship we’ve encountered she always persevered and provided me with everything she possible could; she is my symbol for hope and strength. Priscilla is a kind  funny  and beautiful woman that makes an impact on every single person that she meets. In September of 2017  she was diagnosed with colon cancer where she underwent surgery and chemotherapy for a couple of months. Luckily  with God's grace  she was declared cancer free in March of 2018. Unfortunately  on Tuesday  October 2nd  my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer. She is such a strong and incredible woman and we refuse to give up hope in this battle against cancer. If you could please donate any amount it would mean the world to us to help pay for her medications and treatments. We thank you for your love and support in this difficult time.As great as Canada is with our health care  alternative treatments are not covered such as immunotherapy nor are some medications and supplements covered. Please donate to help us be able to buy these necessities for Priscilla as she will be doing some treatments twice a month and needs her medications everyday.

The Fight Continues,https://www.gofundme.com/cxtcjb-the-fight-continues,1,Clackline,WA,Our friend Deb Craik  is still fighting! through the wonderful support of our amazing community she was able to continue her fight  she is at present undergoing chemotherapy and the burdens are still ever present.   This horrible disease doesn't just go away  and neither should our support! To show our solidarity and that we are always there to support  my daughter Jessica and I are going to shave our heads along with Deb on Saturday 13 October  at the Bakers Hill Rec Centre.     We are are sacrificing our hair  and we are asking you to show your support with a donation towards to shave! all money raised will go towards the ongoing medical bills for Deb's continued fight!(see more details on Debs journey below)Deb moved to Bakers Hill in 1994 with her then 3 year old daughter Maree whilst pregnant with her second daughter Danielle. Her third daughter Shelby was born in 2000 with all 3 girls raised and schooled within the Bakers Hill Community.Deb commenced driving our children to school on our local bus service in 1995 and has driven many of our children to school since then. She began working in our school community at Bakers Hill primary school in 1996 and has been a huge part of early education schooling for many of our kids. Deb and her daughters have played a major role in fundraising for many years within our community.  Her daughter Shelby being the initiator of the annual McGrath fundraiser @ Bakers Hill primary school  which has to date  raised over $10 000 for our community breast care nurse. The Craik family are well known and loved and have helped and supported many of our local families and causes. Now it’s time for our Bakers Hill Community to give a little love and support to Deb. In August 2016  Deb and her families lives were rocked with the news that she had been diagnosed with Cholangial Carcinoma  a form of Liver Cancer that originated within the bile duct. After many appointments with her oncologist  a plan for treatment was developed and so the journey began. In September 2016 Deb underwent her first major surgery which was a liver resection to remove the ten cm tumour. The surgery was involved and not without its risk. Like a true champ  Deb pushed through  and after a few minor setbacks recovered well. Deb was then ready and determined to commence her Chemotherapy treatment. In October 2016 Deb commenced her chemo. Despite the challenges chemotherapy can bring  Deb continued for these three months driving the bus delivering our children safely to school and working in the Kindergarten.  Many parents were unaware of the challenges she was facing. Unfortunately the chemotherapy was unsuccessful and in Feb 17 the Tumour had returned. With her team of Oncologists  it was determined a secondary form of Chemotherapy would be trialled  and so the fight began again. Not an easy road and with a few stalls due to health complications  Deb finally finished her Chemotherapy  all be it a little later than anticipated.She was now ready to start the next phase of treatment  radiation therapy.August 2017 rolled around and SIR spheres were inserted into the cancer effected areas ready to blast and disperse the radiation. Scan results in November joyously reported the Liver as all clear. Celebrations began  holidays were booked to visit her daughter in London. Plans were made and Deb was relieved and excited to have made it through her treatments successfully  and was ready to live life to the fullest and have some fun. Fast forward to February 2018 and her quarterly scans brought the news that the cancer had returned. This time not only in the liver  but also unfortunately the cancer had metastasised to her Lymphatic nodes in both her sternum and chest. And so  the fight begins again. Another liver resection has just been undertaken and Deb is slowly recovering at home unable to work or drive for a short period of time. The radiation beads have been inserted to start radiation therapy as soon as possible with the plan to commence chemotherapy again once radiation has been completed.Chemotherapy is now ongoing.,4286,2000,14,214,25,126,7
Help Mike and Heather Rebuild,https://www.gofundme.com/help-mike-and-heather-rebuild,2,MYRTLEBEACH,SC,Urgent.....Help Needed!! Hi everyone...for those of you who know my parents  William and Heather Grainger  you’ve seen the devastation from some of the pictures I’ve posted. The water has just now receded from the inside of their house.  They would never ask for money and they are always the ones that give and now I want to give back. So I’m asking on their behalf to raise some funding to help them rebuild.  They had just moved into their house and had only been living there for two months when the floods  from hurricane Florence  brought 2-3 feet of water into the house. Prior they had been living in an office with a make-shift kitchen for 10 months while trying to get into their new house. The waters did a lot of damage. I know that they will need new flooring  sheet rock  washer and dryer  mattresses  insulation  paint  cabinets.... and to raise the house will cost $8 000-$10 000.  Please  give a contribution.  No amount is too small. My family and myself would so so appreciate it. FEMA was only able to give them less then a thousand dollars. It’s going to cost them way more than that to help them rebuild.,4400,35000,13,13,24,136,7

Brian Wedgworth Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/brian-wedgworth-medical-fund,8,MCALLEN,TX,Our friend Brian Wedgworth needs help! Brain recently experienced severe pain in his abdomen that led him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer. He has two tumors  one located in his colon and the other on his kidney. Brian is a hardworking and extremely gifted artist (sculptor)  and like many self-employed Americans had to prioritize contributing to his household instead of paying the expenseof healthcare.Fortunately  there is a possible light of hope in the way of MD Anderson Cancer Clinic (Houston  Texas)  which happens to be one of the best facilities in the country.  They have the resources that could very well save Brian’s life.Brian is giant of a man  and his stature is only exceeded by the size his heart.  He is always there for others  with a lending hand or kind words.  So we are asking for all that know him and those who haven’t yet met him to look inside your hearts and please consider helping contribute to his recovery. No amount is too large or too small to help with medical expenses  travel  lodging  and all the other things that can pile up on someone at time like this. Brian lives in a city that is over five hours away from MD Anderson  but it might as well be 10 000 miles away without the funds needed to pay for his care in this most desperate time. If you cannot afford to assist financially  you can still help by sharing this story on your social media feeds. There is a saying that in this life  “we are all in this together”  so please  let us help this wonderful man and his family…Together.,24476,20000,15,122,205,1000,7
Help Kaylee fight CVS,https://www.gofundme.com/kaylee039-specialized-medical-care,0,TEMPLE,TX,"Kaylee is 14  she loves playing her trumpet  dancing and playing soccer. All those things ended  in June of 2017 when she got sick. She began to continuously  vomit and could not stop. We took her to the doctor and the diagnosed her with Cyclic Vomiting syndrome also known as CVS.Cyclic vomiting syndrome  or CVS  is a disorder that causes sudden  repeated attacks—called episodes—of severe nausea and vomiting. Episodes can last from a few hours to several days. Episodes alternate with longer periods of no symptoms. . Episodes can last from a few hours to several days. Experts aren’t sure what causes cyclic vomiting syndrome.Kaylee lost so much weight that we were forced to put a nasal feeding tube in. She was home bound from school and is currently  1 year+ educationally behind. Local Pediatric  GI specialists  gave her a variety  of medications that were either ineffective or had scary side effects that left her incapacitated requiring 911 help. We took several trips to the ER where we were concerned that she would aspirate on her own vomit after being medicated to stop the vomiting.  She would act delusional at the ER after these meds. I sat awake several nights concerned that the next morning i would find her deceased.   She is currently 88 pounds  the most that she has weighed in her life and we are fighting to keep it on her.This illness has taken a toll on all of us  and has impacted every member of the family.  Kaylee's Stepbrother had to save the day and hold he head up in the car on the way to the ER.  Terry is protective of her and cares for her when I have to be at work.  I often miss work when he is not available to care for her to the point where i have concerns about our families future. Terry loves her and his job had been kind enough to allow her to stay on the couch in the back room in the past.  I am the only one in the family that carries insurance on us.  It is not offered at Terry's job. She did not qualify for in home health.I looked for specialists that were experienced in treating this chronic disease and found that the children's hospital of Wisconsin had a clinic that treated other children that share Kaylee's disease. I found thru research and speaking to others in a support group for parents that this is the PLACE to get help. People come from all over the US and the world to seek care. As previously mentioned  I have insurance thru my job and asked that she would be permitted to get the medical care she needed. We were declined  even after submitting documentation from her doctor that it was medically necessary. Instead the insurance company sent us to Houston to see another doctor   who was not a CVS specialist. I argued with them  and tried to make my point that you do not send a patient that needs specialized care to see a doctor that specializes in something completely different.  The insurance company had us in tears and only saw this poor little kid as $$$ to be spent not as a human life in need.  There were no significant results in Kaylee's health as a result of our Trips to Houston.  Surprisingly one day in the spring of 2018  it just stopped. Kaylee was able to return to school  at the end of the school year for half days. She was a normal child again over the summer and got to enjoy her life as a child should without social isolation. Approximately 1 month ago the CVS returned  with vengeance. She made it 3 days in school until i was called to retrieve her. Since then she has not successfully completed a full day of school.  She is back to social isolation   vomiting constantly  sometimes as much as 20 times a hour. She is physically exhausted and some times is not awake for more than 6 hrs a day. Her quality of life is non existent.  I do everything I can to help but its horrible when your child looks at you saying mom make it stop and you cant  and local doctors cant make it stop with their only answers  to help is sedative medications  that are ineffective.  I work a full and a part time job currently  to help pay for her medical expenses  from the previous summers extensive hospitalizations. Kaylee has gotten to the point where she had noticed that we are always paying for her medical care.  This was not intentional but she had asked questions about why mom was always gone in the middle of the night.  I had to explain to her that I had gotten an additional job.  She felt bad that mom had to do it and tells us that \It's ok mom  you do not have to do that\"". We were recently \""approved\"" thru the insurance plan to have genetic testing done.  It is only for limited tests.  She told me that she did not need to do have it done because she does not want to cost us any additional money. I was heart broken.I contacted  social services at the Children's Hospital  of Wisconsin to find that there is no financial  assistance and i must cash pay since the insurance plan refuses to assist.I am asking desperately for help to pay for her medical care at the Children's  Hospital of Wisconsin where she can get the specialized care she needs to attempt to be a normal child again with a MANAGED chronic disease and have a somewhat decent quality of life. We have concerns about what her life will look like as an adult.  Will she be able to go to college successfully?  Will she be able to hold a job?   I do not want to have to see her waste away again and have a unfulfilling life.  No child deserves this disease.  Please take the time to read and share  the more we get the word out the better chances this little one can be well again. Thank you.For more information of this Rare monster disease please read  https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome""",1802,5000,13,36,37,218,7

Please Support Healing Crossroads,https://www.gofundme.com/please-support-healing-crossroads,7,SEBASTOPOL,CA,Dear Community For the last year  I have experienced worsening health that didn't seem to have any obvious explanation. I'm young  have a healthy lifestyle and no family history of major medical issues. Despite my best efforts to address it from every perspective I could (through nutrition  different exercises  Western doctors and alternative practitioners  etc) my health worsened. I could not figure out why I had chronic pain  while I couldn't digest some foods  while I had chronic constipation followed by diarrhea  why I was suddenly deeply exhausted when I had been so energetic before.A few months ago  I was hospitalized from a ruptured ovarian cyst. While in the hospital  they found a large mass in my lower abdomen. A biopsy was sent off to a lab  and then off to UCSF when the first was inconclusive. UCSF was unable to positively identify it as well. It is very unusual in its presentation.Another procedure revealed that I have several polyps in my small colon. The doctor was very surprised  as a polyp that size is very unusual in someone my age with my history. I was told that it would very quickly have turned into colon cancer if it was not found.I am in the process of seeing more specialists  including an oncologist  who can help me to understand what is going on. What is clear to me is this: my body is crying out for help. Something has been wrong for almost a year  but it seems to be unusual and it may take many more visits and holistic perspectives to figure out what.I am a deeply positive individual  who is committed to healing. But I am exhausted. I am in pain most of the time and have a difficult time absorbing any nutrients at the time. What I need is time. I am unable to work until my body is stabilized. The anxiety of money is overwhelming for right now. I need the time to rest and seek the help I need. A donation gives me space  gives me peace of mind  gives me an opportunity to heal deeply and completely. I am deeply  deeply grateful for any and all contributions right now.with love and gratitude Alaina Hernandez,3924,10000,18,39,55,206,7

Fund Vitaly&apos;s ACL Surgery and PT,https://www.gofundme.com/fund-vitaly039s-acl-surgery-and-pt,7,NEWYORK,NY,Fund Dr. Vitaly Dvoskin's ACL Surgery and post-surgery physical therapy. CATASTROPHE has struck and Vitaly needs your help and he would never ask for it. He recently tore his ACL riding his bike home from work in the streets of Manhattan and will need surgery. Unfortunately  Vitaly himself does not have the best healthcare insurance and his costs will not be completely covered  so that's where we come in. We're going to help this man so he can continue helping others on a daily basis  because he's our friend  and because its going to feel good. (c=THE SURGERYThe standard surgery consists of the reattachment of the torn  ligament with approx 6mo's recovery time. This procedure can be done in a hospital or out-patient clinic. In a hospital  cost estimates are in the approx $45K range. In an out-patient clinic estimates are nearly halved to approx $25K.VITALY's COSTS and LONG TERM HEALTHAfter insurance  the estimated out-of-pocket costs will be approx $25k  (includes: the surgery + physical therapy + stem cell treatments). Eugene Lopin and I have collaborated to find a stem cell therapy treatment plan that may help alleviate pain  reduce recovery time  and maximize Vitaly's long term health. The Impact Health Institute is offering 50% off Vitaly's treatment. (VICE episode  on the Institute  (pw: stemcells). WHAT IS HAPPENING NOWAt the moment Vitaly is doing pre-hab work. Recovery is fastest when the muscles around the knee have been strengthened through exercise before surgery.  He will have surgery in the upcoming weeks so its best to fund as soon as possible. ABOUT VITALYFor those of you that don't know Vitaly  he's an 'all-in' kind of guy with a zest and enthusiasm for life. Vitaly's family emigrated to the US when he was young and shortly thereafter he suffered a back injury from a car accident. He overcame this tragedy  a turning point in his life that crystallized his desire to help others.  He worked tirelessly to obtain his graduate degree in physical therapy and started a small clinic  a life-long dream  to treat those suffering from pain and injury. In order to maximize the level of care for his patients he recently opened a new office tailored toward helping them achieve their goals. When he takes on a new patient he seeks to understand the complete nature of their well-being as well as their physical pain. He loves his patients  like his friends and family  and strives to provide the best care that he is humanly capable of. Now he needs your help. Can you go all-in for Vitaly today?

Matt Montaldo&apos;s Fight for Life,https://www.gofundme.com/support-matts-fight,1,Melbourne,VIC,"Matt was first diagnosed with stage-4 stomach cancer two years ago at the age of 35  he underwent intensive cycles of chemotherapy  and additionally took part in clinical trials for drugs in the US. The combination chemotherapy and one drug called Herceptin had a positive effect on Matt’s health and resulted in clear scans for the past two years. Unfortunately  the drug that originally shrunk the tumours so well is no longer effective as the cancer has grown while he has been undergoing regular treatment. This is an extremely aggressive tumour and the cancer has quickly progressed to stage 4 within weeks.  As the cancer grew quickly and was diagnosed late (common with gastric cancer) there is  no option for doctors to remove the stomach through surgery to remove the cancer. Matt is in a desperate short window to make something happen and has gone through intensive radiation with results not yet known but the radiation has cauterised his existing ulcer which is good news for weight gain. Matt is down to 56 kgs (123 lbs) and has just started eating solid food again and attempting to build his strength in preparation for chemotherapy and other treatments.On the 14th of October Matt will be heading to Thailand to start an intensive 6 week chemotherapy and integrative medicine treatment regime  and will have access to specialists and facilities dedicated to this type of treatment. Once Matt finishes the 6 weeks of treatment he will board a plane for Houston to go to MD Anderson for what he hopes is a multi-week plan with experimental drugs vs. \the cancer has progressed too far and all we can do is chemo\"". Faced with no other choice Matt’s best chance of long term survival involves not only mainstream treatments but also radical integrative medicine  unfortunately many of these therapies are extremely expensive even before factoring in travel and everyday living costs. Last time this occurred Matt used every dollar he had participating in trials around the world to save himself. Time is of the essence. We want to support Matt and his wife Anna as much as possible and help ease their financial burden. Any amount that you are able to contribute will mean a lot to Matt.We will use this platform to keep you all up to date. Thank you""",113210,100000,43,113,549,170,7

Stand in the Gap for Sergio Lima,https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-sergio-and-carly,8,HALEIWA,HI,On October 2  Sergio Lima severely injured his knee while surfing an epic swell on Oahu's North Shore. The accident happened at the end of the video clip. As the wave closed out  Sergio tried to turn  but his right foot slipped off the board. The wave crest landed on his board and left leg  pulling both down and away. Preliminary reports indicate at least a torn PCL (posterior cruciate ligament)  which means surgery and a long rehab.This husband and father of two young children supports his family with multiple jobs  including surf instructor  youth pastor  and coffee roaster. He is amazing at all three. In addition  Sergio does various woodworking and construction jobs  but his favorite side job is testing prototype surfing fins. He's amazing at those jobs  too!All these jobs require a fully-functioning Sergio  which won't be the case for at least a month. This is where we would like to help the Lima family. If you know them at all  the Lima's are always helping others out. They are one of those families that make communities better. Much better. If you asked them how you could help  the Limas would probably just ask you to pray. Do that for sure  but if you can also give some of your hard-earned cash to support this hard-working man while he can't work  we know that would bless them tremendously!,6401,6400,19,100,34,110,7
Shane&apos;s Medical Expense Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/shane039s-medical-expense-fund,1,WESTERVILLE,OH,￼￼￼￼On May 25  2017  Shane Layne  a friend  brother  son  and father was diagnosed with Stage II B stomach cancer (Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor). This was a shock to us all  especially for Shane as he was already going through a huge life changing event in the form of a divorce. Once diagnosed  a plan was put in place. He went through surgery to remove the growth  however  the cancer was more aggressive than originally thought and spread to local lymph nodes. After the surgery  Shane began chemo and radiation therapy. After a couple rounds of traditional chemo and radiation  Shane was introduced to a ground-breaking medical treatment that attacked the cancer more directly. The downside to this treatment was that the innovative trials were not covered by insurance. Shane being a fighter did not let this stop him from getting the treatment. He emptied his savings  maxed out his credit cards  and took out a personal loan to pay for the treatments. During this time  Shane continued his work as a financial crime investigator and tried to spend as much time as possible with his 4 year old boy (3 at the time of diagnosis). He continued to fight and was an inspiration all of us. After a few months  the cancer was apparently gone. However  in January 2018 after a routine checkup it was discovered that the cancer came back more aggressively than before (spread to intestine). He once again had to undergo surgery multiple times and he was able to receive the same treatments from 2017  however this was again not covered by insurance. It was such a relief for Shane’s friends and family to learn that as of June 15  2018 he entered remission and the cancer is gone!These days Shane continues to live his best life and enjoys spending time with his son. As Shane continues to have a great spirit  we  realize the financial struggle he is going through as the treatments have cost him over $100 000.

She went for DNA testing 10 months ago because our family has a history of cancer and she got the news that she was negative for any breast cancer genes  We thought Great! Then 3 weeks ago she felt a lump on her breast and went for a mammogram and was told the news that she has Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Breast Cancer... This was shocking news to us and we started to worry about how we will pay for these bills on top of all our other expenses for our family. She was told she has to do Chemo  then Surgery  then Radiation to get rid of this cancer so she can \go on and annoy her kids for the next 30 years.\"" These treatments will cost a lot of out of pocket copay which she can't come up with on her own and since she wont be able to work as much or at all these funds will be very important. These funds will be used to pay for the visits  treatments  recovery  and bills while she deals with this Breast Cancer. I am asking for all the help we can get and even though my mother doesn't like asking for help she is at the point where she knows she can not continue with the way her finances are. We really appreciate any assistance  (donating OR sharing) that you can give our mom (Leslie) and thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.""",5128,15000,12,34,49,319,6

Stephanie will beat cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-stephanie-battle-cancer,1,MURRIETA,CA,The world as she knew it changed late September 2018 when my sister in law Stephanie went to the doctor for a swollen lymph node in her upper right leg. After weeks of testing and procedures  Stephanie was diagnosed with stage 4 malignant melanoma. Her battle with melanoma is back and has metastasized to her left lung. She is 31 years old  Married and a mother of 4 beautiful children (ages 12 10 19 month old TWINS) Stephanie is active  non smoker and otherwise healthy. This devastating news has left her family and friends heartbroken  and has left her husband Ryan with the unimaginable and overwhelming tasks of arranging care for their 4 children/19 month old twins  managing treatment schedules  and figuring out how to pay for it all.They plan to fight this cancer aggressively  and will do whatever it takes to get Stephanie the best care in the country  with or without the support of their health insurance. But they need your help to make this possible. Please  give what you can to help this special family. The funds will go toward: medical expenses  travel expenses (if they need to travel for state-of-the-art treatments)  and general day-to-day expenses that will become difficult to manage.As you can imagine  her family are in a whirl of emotions  but we want nothing more than to get Stephanie healthy to see her 4 beautiful children grow up. Stephanie battled melanoma in 2011 and is ready to battle it again. She is asking everyone to please keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers. She is having surgery on Wednesday to remove the lesion off her lung and will be in recovery for several weeks/months  cancer treatment to follow for a year. Stephanie is self employed and going to have to take a significant amount of time off of work.I have made a GoFundMe to help this beautiful family. If you can donate  that would mean the world  please keep her in your prayers and share her story.❤,9325,15000,7,62,90,992,7
Ruthann Bullard,https://www.gofundme.com/ruthann-bullard,1,ROCHESTER,MI,On February 8th  2018 Ruthann Bullard went for a simple routine colonoscopy.  Her life  and the lives of us who love her changed that day. A tumor was detected in her colon and she was immediately sent for a CT scan. That  CT scan revealed that Ruthann has inoperable  STAGE 4 Colon Cancer which has Metastasized to both lobes of her liver. 10 tumors were discovered in her liver.We were in shock to say the least. Ruthann is a RN. She is a dedicated mother  daughter  and friend.  She is my best friend.  For those of you who know her  know she is gorgeous  active  strong  health conscious  intelligent  and funny as hell.  She didn't seem sick at all!  She had just started a new exciting career in Real Estate just months prior.  Ruthann was just as busy as ever  never missing a beat. How could this be happening?Well  it is happening. At Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital  the week after diagnosis  Ruthann had a medical port placed in her chest for Chemotherapy treatments she would soon be receiving.  A liver biopsy was performed at that time as well to determine the genetics behind the tumors.Ruthann's Oncologist prescribed 12 rounds of Chemotherapy to be administered every other week. Treatments began February 27th. A few of her treatments were postponed due to low white blood cells  and low platelets. In the end  she made it through those 12 like a champ and with grace.As of late August  after 8 months and 12 rounds of Chemotherapy  the tumors have decreased in size  but due to the number of tumors  surgery is still not an option. Her case was presented to the Tumor Board at Beaumont Hospitals  and the Doctors on board unanimously agreed that Ruthann needs to continue chemotherapy.  With the type of cancer she has  there is no time to waste. Ruthann is steadfast in her journey  her fight  and in beating cancer. In September she began another round of 12 treatments in hopes to decrease the tumor burden on the liver and ultimately become a candidate for surgery.  Her off weeks from Chemo are used for recovery and the administration of high dose Vitamin C IV treatments to help increase energy. I am grateful for your financial support for Ruthann during her greatest fight. She is so thankful as well. Ruthann has been unable to work considering her diagnosis and has had no income since. The medical bills are rolling in and well as regular monthly bills and expenses  and 2019 deductibles will need to be met here soon enough.  Its a lot as you can imagine. Along with  donations  I ask for your prayers for Ruthann and her three beautiful children throughout this journey. Many Blessings to you and yours Valerie Perry. #CANCER MAY HAVE STARTED THE FIGHT BUT I WILL FINISH IT #BE BRAVE.

Jenn&apos;s Healing Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/jenn039s-healing-fund,1,NAPLES,FL,My beautiful sister Jenn Ebenroth  who is dearly loved by many  is one of the strongest people I know. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2011  over 7 years ago. Since that time she has been living with cancer  exploring and utilizing natural and alternative modalities  all of which have allowed her to grow  heal and transform emotionally  mentally and spiritually. Unfortunately  on the physical side  the cancer has continued to progress. As a result  she has had to make some difficult but potentially life saving decisions regarding her treatment plan. With a team of wonderful  caring doctors  nurses and healers from Salish Cancer Center in Washington state  who support an integrative approach to cancer treatment  she has started a combined immunotherapy/chemotherapy treatment which has already had an amazing effect on the cancer. Her response to the treatment has been incredible  and the doctors are more than pleased  perhaps even overjoyed  with what they are seeing in such a short amount of time. Unfortunately  with this treatment comes side effects  mainly hair loss and extreme fatigue and weakness. So Jenn will need time to rest  heal and recover during the next several months. I wanted to start a fundraising campaign to support her financially. The funds will help cover some of her living expenses as well as vitamins and supplements during this time of healing  so she doesn't have to worry. I am incredibly hopeful about her recovery and appreciate the support you can provide. It will allow her to concentrate entirely on her healing and complete recovery.Thank you  Melissa Hennig,1631,3000,17,54,20,81,7
Anchors For Jessica,https://www.gofundme.com/anchors-for-jessica,0,FORTLAUDERDALE,FL,This is my beautiful sister  Jessica Amanda.  She is 35 years old  and a mother to two amazing boys  Elias Kalel and Jacob Emmanuel.  Earlier this year  Jessica began to experience swelling in her right foot for a few months.  She finally went in and found out that she had an extensive blood clot along her right femoral vein.  Over the next months  due to her persistence of finding out the answers as to why her body formed a blood clot  she referred herself to a new doctor who sent her for an MRI.  Doctors found that she had a 5cm mass located in her right upper thigh next to the femoral vein.  It has been a long road since then. Within the last few months  she has had CT scans and a PETScan to check for malignant cells in her body.  Because she has been on blood thinners  she was recently hospitalized by her amazing doctors  in order to safely do a biopsy of the mass.  Our world changed when we found out that the mass is a Malignant Sarcoma.  Sarcomas are very rare  and they are also an aggressive type of cancer. On Tuesday  October 2  she went to the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center and met with one of the best sarcoma doctors and teams in Florida.  Her world was devastated and shaken when she found out how aggressive this cancer is and the intensity the chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be.  If you know Jessica  you know how great her heart and her faith is  and how strong  loving  and courageous she has been throughout her life.  She has a love that is supernatural and genuine  and a smile that can change anyone’s world around and bring LIGHT to it. However  despite the immense amount of faith and strength that she has  her knees buckled hearing that she would not be able to work or provide for her kids for the next 6 months  as she is the main provider in her home for her and her children.   Her body will be going through a lot  and her immune system can not be compromised during these next 6 months  because she is a teacher  working throughout treatment is not on option and she will need to take a leave. Unfortunately  FMLA is not paid and the amount of time that she must take off will be more than 60 days  so she will have to pay her own medical insurance  as well.  I am asking first and foremost for all of the prayer warriors to please keep my sister  Jessy  in constant and fervent prayer.  The next thing I ask is for donations to help her and her boys during this battle journey for her life.  According to her doctors  they have one chance to get it right so that they not only kill the cancerous tumor  remove it with precision and with extreme caution  and make sure that every rogue cell is destroyed so that it does not return.  They will not allow her to work because they have to protect her  as they help her beat  fight  and destroy the cancer.  She will need help paying her mortgage and monthly bills.We love you all and appreciate you for taking the time to read this  pray  and consider giving.  We will continue to keep you updated.  Jessica is very open to receiving calls  emails  and text messages of encouragement.  She will need it now more than ever as we help carry her and her children through this storm.  Thank you  on behalf of me  my mom Nelida  my brothers and sisters  and all of our family who are coming together to get her through this.  There are some who have reached out and considered giving monthly and that is also an option.  Many have reached out asking for ways to help or be a part of the Chemotherapy schedule to take her to and from appointments.   She will need approximately 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Each cycle consists of 3 weeks. Week 1 will be 5 days of chemotherapy for an average of 4-5 hours a day. Week 2 will be blood work 3 days a week to monitor her immune system  and week 3 will be radiation and a small recovery period.Anyone who would like to help and be there  we ask that you please get a flu shot. Thank you again for taking the time to read and share!! Please feel free to email me at: AnchorForJessica@gmail.com for any questions  information  updates  ways you can help or her mailing address.,11410,25000,12,46,159,1000,7

He is a husband  a son  a brother  a dad  a friend  an uncle and a papa. Bill and Debbie welcomed me into their family 3.5 years ago. They are amazing people who are so generous and always help others. Bill and Debbie just helped pay for Zak and my wedding on 9.22.18.  I am so blessed to have amazing in laws like them. Bill is an amazing Papa to Brody. They have an amazing relationship. Bill loves to go fishing and be in the outdoors with his family.Bill was diagonsised with kidney cancer a few years ago and was treated. In rountine check ups to continue to scan for the cancer his doctor missed crucial information that the cancer came back in his lungs. He went untreated because of this miss and in later follow up visits they would find out that the cancer spread all over his lungs. 2 years ago Bill went through immunotherapy to treat the cancer. The doctors informed him only 10% of patients response positively to this treatment. Bill was 1 of the 10% and went into full remission for 18 months. It breaks my heart to say Bill just found out the cancer came back and is in lungs and 1 of his adrenal glands. I am raising money in hope to help them get through this extremely difficult time. Bill will be starting treatments that will hospitalize him for several weeks at a time and will be unable to generate an income.We are so grateful for prayers and any donations at this time❤️ Thank you❤️,2045,10000,17,20,25,94,7

Growing tumor of Ramel Racan,https://www.gofundme.com/s5rqtt-tumor,0,HONOLULU,HI,I recently learned that a classmate of us back in highschool is sick and so one of our classmate checked on him through messenger and ask how he is doing only to find out that his situation is getting serious.  His name is Ramel Racan  he explained that he suddenly felt pain back in July and his lower back started swelling. He had himself checked and was suggested to get a CT scan  its a bit pricey for him since he is a service crew in a fastfood chain working with a minimun wage and he does not have a decent medical insurance.The test was done twice and he was only informed that his body was normal and that it is a tumor  it grew faster as days and months passed and since its hard for him to walk or even stand anymore  he had no choice but to stop working and without an income he can no longer afford to visit a doctor and have himself checked again. So I told him that we  his batchmates will do our best to help him in this unfortunate situation.  He has been suffering from the pain since July of this year. He lives in Philippines but my batchmates said they're unable to make a page at gofundme in Philippines due to address issues. Since i live in Hawaii now  i am asking for whatever amount you guys could donate to help a dear friend of ours who is in great need of financial help. We humbly ask that you extend your helping hands through this donation site so our friend can be treated and can get a surgery as soon as possible for the large tumor (mass on his back and now affecting his stomach) that continues to grow each day.  The first picture showed him earlier this year without the tumor and then below image as of now October of 2018.,335,3000,3,11,10,362,7
The Tin Man&#x2019;s Heart,https://www.gofundme.com/the-tin-mans-heart,6,VILLARICA,GA,In 2013 I was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome. It’s a heart condition that causes fast chaotic heart rhythms. It’s very often so painful for me  that it takes my breath away and causes me to become so light headed that I can no longer stand. ￼ As a result  I’ve suffered painful PVC episodes and arrhythmia for 5 long years while working closely with my cardiologist to find relief. While treatment does help  there is no cure for this disorder. My three children suffer most from this bit of knowledge. ￼I was put on a beta blocker for a little while to control my irregular heartbeat  the side effect caused my hair to fall out. I’m a hairstylist by profession  so this treatment was a heartbreaking option. (No pun intended)￼I’ve been waiting for a pacemaker for two years. Pregnancy and other conditions prevented me from getting that surgery. I finally have the opportunity to receive some real relief. I’ll be scheduling my surgery for June of 2019! I dont have paid leave at my job. And I’ll be taking at least two weeks off for the surgery and my recovery. I’m just trying to raise enough money to cover one months worth of pay to cover groceries  child care  and other bills. The pacemaker won’t cure my condition. But it will make the years I have left a time to be enjoyed with my wonderful babies!,180,2000,21,9,6,17,7

He suffered a Massive Hemorrhagic Stroke to the left side of his brain while he was at work. A job he has been at for the last 20 years.  He was blessed to be working with friends who knew something was wrong instantly.  They were able to get the ambulance there within minutes.  He was rushed to the Ephrate Hospital which was only a block from where they were working that day. Once he was there he was quickly assessed that he needed to be Life Flighted to York Hospital.Back Story Anyone who has ever met him knows what a kind  loving  easy going  hardworking  and one of a kind guy he is. He is a husband  father  son  brother  grandfather and dear friend. He is the type of guy that is always willing to do anything for anyone. He would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. He's always willing to help everyone else but now he is the one in need. He is the sole provider for his family. So this is a very hard hit. We are asking friends  family  communities at large  organizations  and anyone that has been personally touched by Michael (Spank) Guinn's many acts of kindness to assist us in eliminating financial hardships and barriers to his recovery. Any money received will go straight to his family to cover medical expenses  help defer some of his loss wages  and help his family with travel expenses. His family will have to travel from Sunbury  PA to York  PA daily. Which is about 62 miles one way. It is going to be a long road ahead for all of his family.

Jan&#x2019;s Pats relationship fund,https://www.gofundme.com/jans-pats-relationship-fund,7,LITTLEELM,TX,My wife contracted non alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. We were unaware of the disease until a number of untoward things took us to the Dr and she was diagnosed. Because of the severity of the disease  I had to quit my job of 13 years  where I was making $1500 000 a year and take over as her full time medical caretaker. I did that  without a paycheck for two years. The love of my life passed in March of 2018. Our oldest son passed of heart problems just before Thanksgiving  2017. It has not been a great year seeing as I lost two great people In my life and I will never forget them  but  I will never forget them. May God Bless them and and never forget them. I will never forget thembut I will work through through them.,420,20000,16,2,5,22,7

"Medlife Cusco, Peru Medical Service",https://www.gofundme.com/medlife-cusco-peru-medical-service,7,HuntingtonStation,NY,Hi guys! I'm planning on taking a trip to Cusco  Peru with my local Medlife chapter at Binghamton University. Recently I joined the on-campus ambulance service and I'm training to become an EMT. I would love to go to Peru to help out in any way possible. On the trip  we'll be completing a public service project (ex. building stairs)  while also shadowing medical professionals  helping in running medical clinics  and learning about local medical practices  global medicine  and the effect of poverty on health. Community service has always been an integral part of my life  and I want to continue that outside of the country; this trip would allow me to help others in desperate need for medical care. This trip would also be a wonderful learning opportunity  and would give me valuable real-world  medical experience to help me further my career towards becoming a doctor. I'm currently on a full tuition scholarship  but my family still needs to pay for room and board. There are no extra funds to allocate towards my trip this winter.  My fundraising efforts would help me pay for the airfare and for my time in Cusco  Peru. Any donations would be greatly appreciated! Thank you. To learn more about the trip  visit: https://www.medlifemovement.org/about-us.html,210,4500,10,5,5,41,6

Naomi Grace is defeating the odds!,https://www.gofundme.com/naomi-grace-is-defeating-the-odds,4,NORFOLK,NE,On October 1  2018 Naomi Grace was born to Lukas and Tara Sudbeck. Naomi was born with ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) this disease does not allow Naomi’s kidneys to function properly. Before birth  Naomi was given a 1% chance of survival and beat those odds! Upon arrival Naomi was well over 8 pounds and over all as healthy as we could expect. On October 3rd  within her first days of life  Naomi underwent surgery to have dialysis ports placed in her abdomen and neck  and to have one or both of her kidneys removed.. again Naomi defied the odds and was allowed to keep one of her kidneys. Naomi will be sedated for a few days so that her healing can begin with minimal movement. Her body is taking well to dialysis  but tomorrow is not promised and we are hopeful and optimistic.  Luke and Tara plan to pray and fight for Naomi. Please help this family give Naomi the fighting chance she deserves.,6331,7500,6,84,71,1000,7
Continuous Treatment for Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/Continuous-Treatment-Cancer,8,SYLVA,NC,On August 4th of 2018  I was diagnosed with stage 3 renal cell kidney cancer.  The tumor was very large and needed a surgical procedure called a radical nephrectomy.  This is when the infected kidney is fully removed.  The tumor had also grown into the vena ceva artery which turned a 2 hour surgery into a 6 1/2 hour surgery.  Recovery has been hard and the long road ahead is sure to be just as tough.  As many of you can imagine  this came very fast  without warning and has changed our lives in many ways.  My recovery visits will be to many medical facilities within an hour to three hours of drive time.   Please consider donating to help us with the many miles of travel  appointments  medications and the mounding medical bills we are now receiving.  We are optimistic about life and this new journey is one that will test our strengths and weaknesses.  With your help and generosity my recovery will be less stressful on my family and I.  My family and I would like to thank everyone of you for any contribution you can make.  Please feel free to share my store with your friends and family.  We will update periodically  as time permits  on my recovery. Thank you,1350,20000,10,7,22,172,7
Support for Louis and his family,https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-louis-and-his-family,9,MERIDEN,CT,Louis was suddenly struck with a medical emergency. On Sept. 30th he started experiencing severe back pain. He was bed ridden for the next 3 days. On Oct. 2nd he suddenly lost feeling in both legs. He collapsed to the floor and was brought to the hospital by ambulance. After extensive testing they found a severe infection in his spine. He was sent for emergency spine surgery to remove all of the infection. The next day they found out he has MRSA which is what started all of this. The infection spread from his blood to his spine and compressed all of the nerves from the navel down. He is currently in the ICU being treated. He is starting to get some movement back in his toes  but the doctor isn’t sure if any permanent damage was done to his nerves.  After the treatment for MRSA and recovery from his surgery are done at the hospital he will be sent to a rehab facility to hopefully gain some mobility back. All of this suddenly happened while he was without medicial insurance. His family was a one income family down to a no income family. While the hospital bills will be enormous  they are really worried about the cost of every day living for his wife and 2 children  bills and gas and expenses back and forth to the hospital to visit him while his wife tries to find a job. His recovery right now is at least 2-3 months and that’s if he gets full feeling back in his legs. It could possibly be a lot longer.,2750,10000,8,28,23,245,7
Rachel Litfin Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/living-expensesmedical,0,LOSANGELES,CA,"I fully believe that help can be found if only you are willing to ask. And I am in dire need of a helping hand.***Update - 10/09/2018***I just want to say thank you to everyone who helped me blow past the original goal of $3 000 in just a few days. I’m so overwhelmed and grateful for all the messages  shares  donations  love  and support I’ve received. I love you all so much. I don’t feel so alone anymore. I will now be able to afford my basic living expenses  rent  and bills through the end of November as I stay well off my foot. However  I have some really bad news about my recovery status. As it turns out  I finally got in to see the specialist  and it’s worse than originally thought. The only way to fix my right foot is through surgery. I will need pins put in through my bones  and if that’s not successful  a full metal plate will additionally need to go in. Safe to say  I’m pretty scared right now. I’m not okay. Insurance can only cover so much  and overall it won’t nearly be enough. And I need to have this surgery within the next week or so  or else I risk severe future complications. I’ve upped my goal to try and meet as much of this need as possible. Please  please if you can  share this campaign around once more. I feel so nervous putting myself out here  but I also know that it’s okay to ask for help when you most need it. I know one day I will be able to return this kindness tenfold back into the world. Thank you so much for your time!******************************************Original Post:Around midnight on 10/04/18  coming home from a set  I hit a semi full on. I totaled my Honda. My right foot is broken  and I am severely bruised throughout my chest (thank you seat belt). It hurts to breathe  and I cannot put any weight or pressure on my foot at all. I am in a great amount of pain. I need to find a new car once insurance processes  but I cannot even drive said car until my right foot heals. This reality is giving me severe amounts of anxiety (as I HAVE to drive to my work assignments  as well as to my book events and signings. Basically my survival depends on my mobility). I need to find someway to keep myself afloat for the next 4-6 weeks as I heal  along with keeping up with bills and out of pocket medical costs. And that's where you come in. I hate asking for help. I don't know what to do with myself when people go out of their way for me. I'm always trying to give as much as I can to my loved ones. To have to ask this kind of thing makes me so nervous  but several dear friends and family have suggested that it's okay to ask for help  and that you don't always have to be \the strong one\"".So  here I am. I have realized I am truly in need. My book sales already make a good amount of my income  but only if I am actually able to GET to my events. And  even then  it's not going to be enough to take care of this life event.I'm guesstimating at this point that $3 000 will put me in a good place to be able to survive the incoming costs and medical bills for the next several weeks as I heal. If you are able to send anything at all  I would be so deeply grateful. And  even if you are not in a position to donate  I would be just as thankful if you could share this link. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time!￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼""",4687,10000,14,47,97,487,7

My Dad&apos;s surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/tba3e-my-dad039s-surgery,6,NAPLES,FL,"As many know by now  the current situation in Venezuela is not the greatest.  My father  Jose Gustavo Sanchez Sr   has been ill for sometime now due to his prostate. He was on medication for it and it helped for sometime. Unfortunately  again  due to the situation  the medication became more difficult to obtain and he ran into an emergent situation already three times where he has needed a catheter and irrigation to stop the bleeding. Now  his illness has reached the point that the catheter and medications can no longer benefit him. He needs to have an emergency surgery to remove his prostate. This is a critical time for my father  in which not having this surgery could culminate into a chain of events that can be deadly. He has already been in the hospital twice  in which  all they do is \stabilize\"" him and send him right back home.The surgery has been estimated at $2000 US Dollars  which in Venezuelan money (bolivares) translates to what here would be about $30 000 apprx.We are in desperate need of help. We really appreciate in advance any and all help and prayers for my dad. I will have the funds transfered to my brother's Venezuel's account in Bolivares (Venezuela's currency) he then will take care of the hospital bil   doctor's fees  medications  after care and also food and supplies needed for recovery. We are hoping to have enough funds for the surgery to be done next week. They have a planned surgery for Tuesday  10/9   if funds are available. Unlike here in the US  surgery and/or any medical procedure in Venezuela requires full payment upfront. They will not operate without payment....even if the patient is in critical condition..such as the case my dad is in currently. The funds will be given directly to our younger brother Josue who is currently residing in Venezuela caring for our dad. Once we have the total amount needed for surgery  he will be able to pay and confirm the surgery date.The entire Sanchez Family thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Sincerely Jose Gustavo & Veronika Sanchez (son  daughter-in-law)Gustavo Josue Sanchez (son)Cristina Sanchez  Isaac Andino  Barbara Andino (daughter  grandson  granddaughter)Please SHARE this post.If you have any questions regarding this  please feel free to  contact me directly.""",240,2500,9,10,5,46,7

The Brombosz&apos;s vs Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/67tw368,1,ODESSA,FL,We have all been touched by that nasty word called Cancer. If I only look within my family   it’s shocking to think how our lives have been effected and who has been taken from us due to this terrible disease. I also look at those who have beaten or “won “ the battle . Then I think   have they really won?  Aren’t most of our loved ones continually battling the side effects and paying the price mentally   emotionally and lets not forget financially. 10 years later my husband and I fight everyday to overcome the different side effects from the chemo and radiation treatments.  John Brombosz   a social worker here at the Medical Center of Trinty  who most of you know  is now standing along side his wife  Denise  and again battling cancer. John has been with the Medical Center of Trinity for many years. If you know John   there is no need to explain why we should help. If you don’t know John   think about your best friend   that is who he is. When you meet John he makes you feel like you’ve been friends for 20 years   he makes you laugh   he’s always there to listen   he always there to assist in anyway possible. He thinks of others before himself and my favorite part about John is the way he loves his wife. They are best friends and soulmates and she is his Hero. I know we all have been asked at one time or another   probably today at the pet store or Publix to donate $1   if we all donate $1 or $5 we can reach the $5000 goal or maybe even surpass it quickly. Anything donated will help John and Denise rest a little easier and maybe help her recover a little faster. The less stress the better as we all know as health professionals.

Cape Fear Rugby Hurricane Relief,https://www.gofundme.com/cape-fear-rugby-hurricane-relief,2,WILMINGTON,NC,Cape Fear Rugby Football Club’s (CFRFC) property has been severely damaged by Hurricane Florence. We’ve lost our shelter  our storage container  and all of its contents.Sewage lines close by leaked into the flooding that engulfed our field. This GoFundMe is to support club recovery efforts in the absence of insurance coverage. Any funds not distributed to Cape Fear Rugby will be donated to other hurricane relief efforts in the area. Rugby  as violent as the sport’s reputation is  is a relaxing getaway for many of the people that play it. It brings people together from all walks of life and gives them a common ground to bond over. Cape Fear Rugby Football Club is no different. Established in 1974  we are one of the few clubs in the area fortunate enough to have our own pitch (field) to practice  play  and socialize on. We purchased the land that was a landfill at the time  and cleared it out ourselves. Our pitch is our home away from home. It also just so happens to be one of the last large open grass fields in the downtown area of Wilmington  NC. Our field is used not just by us  but also by the women’s rugby clubs  the collegiate rugby club  the youth rugby club  and our neighbors of the city that don’t play rugby. People come from all over town to run their dogs  have picnics  play Frisbee  fly drones  play with their kids  and practice their golf game  among other things. We open our home up to just about anybody  as long as they are respectful of it. We enjoy being a part of the community and making Wilmington a better place to live.Hurricane Florence came in and wrecked our home. The field was completely flooded  our shelter was destroyed  the storage container we used to store all of the club’s belongings was flooded and trashed  our sponsor boards were ripped away  and our natural coverage of trees was decimated by Florence’s wind and rain. So now  on top of dealing with the after effects of the storm on our personal lives  ranging from fallen trees on houses  flooded homes  ruined HVAC units  and other storm related damage  we have to work on rebuilding our club; our second home.We have all been there for each other throughout this storm and  if anything  it has made our bond stronger. We’ve grouped together and helped each other out as much as we’ve been able to. Many people familiar with our club and the efforts we’ve been putting forth have reached out and expressed a desire to contribute to the club and its members that have been impacted by the hurricane.

Blindt Family,https://www.gofundme.com/blindt-family,9,HUNTINGTONBEACH,CA,The purpose of this page is to help in any way that you can. Helping can be as easy as sending words of encouragement  sending a letter or thoughtful gift for the twins or their siblings who are struggling with their parents being away so much to care for their siblings. Monetary donations are also a huge blessing as their medical bills are all consuming.   This family right here is so inspiring! They have managed to raise a beautiful  loving and nurturing family despite any obstacles that have come their way. Ryder and Sadie were born at 31 weeks. After a very emotional pregnancy that kept Andrea in the hospital for months. They both were diagnosed with a blood disorder and have had trouble eating orally since birth which required them to both undergo surgery for feeding tubes. The twins spent 106 long painful days in the hospital before finally joining their siblings and parents at home. The twins have seen every type of specialist. Medical bills have been piling up for almost 2 years. Donations of any kind are greatly appreciated and much needed: anything from notes/letters or activities for the older kids to keep them occupied to meals or gas cards. Monetary donations are huge to help pay for Ryder and Sadie as they are still on feeding tubes and have numerous tests and appointments each week: physical therapy  occupational therapy  feeding tube supplies  specialized blended food diets  wellness checks and exams from different departments. Ryder and Sadie require so much love that  Andrea has not been able to work outside of the house and that left Ryan being the sole provider for the family. He however  was recently let go from his job this past month  which means they also lost their insurance. Ryan and Andrea are two of the most generous and loving people you’d ever meet. I only wish I lived closer to help with meals  babysitting  and just being an extra hand or ear. Nurturing one child to thrive can be a full time job in itself  then add medical conditions  known and still unknown  limited health insurance and other kids to love on  it can make that goal seem so far from view. With so little leisure time  they both have to be extra creative in making big sister Micaela and big brother Ethan   feel just as special as their siblings. Talk about endurance. I admire how they keep it all together but I also know that it’s by the grace of God and loved ones that can help carry them through this challenging time.Please  if you can help at all  with your time  meals  ideas  prayer  support and/or a donation  it would be so appreciated.Also if you know anyone who needs an awesome mortgage broker Ryan is your man!

Love and Help for Candie Iannuzzi,https://www.gofundme.com/love-and-help-for-candie-iannuzzi,9,MURRIETA,CA,One of our dear and most beloved friends Candie Marie Timpson Iannuzzi needs your help.  Candie is in desperate need of a liver transplant.  November 2017 Candie collapsed and was hospitalized several times and put on some heavy medication.   December 9  2017 she was admitted to USCD.  After many more hospital visits and medical testing the doctors  determined she has liver failure and cancerous cells and is now  in need of a liver transplant.     As of January 2018 she is now a patient  of the UCSD Transplant Center.  The hospital has worked very hard at keeping her stable but she continuously is in and out of the hospital fighting for her life.   They have waitlisted her for a liver transplant but the waitlist in California is very high and they have told her that she could most likely pass away while waiting for a liver here.  The doctors have recommended that she duel list to be on a transplant list in  other states so that her chances of obtaining a liver are much higher and so is the survival rate because the required meld number required for a transplant is much lower.  She is now in the process of being waitlisted at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.  It is required by the Mayo Clinic that any transplant patients live within the area of the hospital in order to be waitlisted for an organ transplant.   Candie and her husband Gary have made the decision that this would be best so that her chances of getting a liver would be much greater.As you can imagine this has been a tremendous toll on her  her husband Gary and her 4 wonderful children Arianna  Adam  Austin and Anthony.    We are asking for contributions to assist the family with the outrageous medical costs that can not be covered by insurance  up and coming expenses and also for the relocation cost to Arizona. This is a temporary move but a necessary one for her survival.  Anything you can do would be appreciated and please feel free to reach out to her and send her some love.  She is very much asking that you keep her and her family in your prayers.  She needs all the prayer warriors she can get!!!Much Love,9565,50000,19,19,77,265,7

Carron&#x2019;s road to recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/for-carrons-recovery,8,ELIZABETH,NJ,On August 31  2018 around 8:30 pm  my 17 year old nephew was a victim of a horrendous hit and run while riding home on his skateboard on his way home from work.  He sustained life threatening injuries which required him to stay in the surgical ICU for 2 1/2 weeks. Due to his condition his mother was unable to work due to her spending days and nights at UMDNJ next to her only child's bedside praying for his recovery. My nephew is still in the hospital and his mother is there with him daily trying her best to support him while he is recovering. Unfortunately the family has depleted all finances during this time. My nephew who is known to his community as a well mannered  kind  funny  humble and smart kid with a bright future ahead of him  still has a very long road to recovery. Sadly insurance does not cover all the expenses the family has incurred. Myself and the family are asking for donations to help alleviate some of the financial burden that has tragically been placed on them.  P.S. He still has to get a tutor and he has to have a outpatient occupational  physical and speech therapy for at least 6 months. So please any donation is greatly appreciated. We thank you for love  support  and prayers.  http://newjersey.news12.com/story/39011675/linden-teen-fights-for-life-after-being-struck-by-car,1360,3000,8,45,17,174,7
Bender Family Flood Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/bender-family-flood-recovery,2,BURGAW,NC,Dear Family  Friends  & Our Wider Community  Billy & I are reaching out today with an urgent call for help! Thousands of North Carolinians have become victims of the tragic and utter devastation that Hurricane Florence has left in its wake. Our family in Burgaw (within Pender County) became just that as the massive swelling of the Northeast Cape Fear River flooded their ranch home rendering it an uninhabitable wasteland to attempt to salvage and rebuild. Billy’s brother Steven  his wife Allison  & their children Zac & Kim  have lost nearly all their personal possessions to the Cape Fear River’s deluge.It’s been nearly three weeks now and people who weren’t affected by Hurricane Florence are already moving on with their lives yet for the members of our family in North Carolina  the hardship they are enduring has proven itself to be one that will span many months to come. The whole experience is immensely exhausting both physically & mentally for them all.  Displaced from their home  they are currently blessed with having a place to temporarily live and most importantly  are all safe. At the same time  they still must continue to pay their mortgage  pay rent for their current residence  purchase food  clothing  toiletries  household goods  & furniture all the while requiring major amounts of money to even begin the recovery process. This entails removing all the raw sewerage  chemical waste  silt & mud that has seeped in  gutting the house down to its studs  & remediating the massively accumulating mold. This exorbitant expense all must be addressed before they can even consider rebuilding  refurnishing & installing all new appliances for everything was destroyed. They do not have flood insurance yet were able to meet with FEMA and are hopeful about some assistance in that regard. Not knowing how much  or even when any monetary resources might be dispersed  they are in desperate need of immediate financial support so as to halt the onslaught of damage that is advancing within their home each & every day.      Looking from the top of the hill leading to their cul-de-sac. The Bender family's house is to the left hidden behind the street sign and brush. Notice the height of the water by the sign & the back home...the Cape Fear River was still rising at this point & hadn't reached it's peak.The flood water entered the house up to 3 feet throughout.The first round of debris removed...nothing is salvageable when one's entire home sits in contaminated river water for 10 days straightAs I'm writing this  I cannot help but think about a well-known statement that Steve recently posted which I believe sums up all the wonderfulness that typifies this family  even in times of such intense hardship: ”Life is 10% what happens to you & 90% how you handle it ” he posted to his friends & family. Their optimism & compassion for others in spite of their own adversity shines ever so brightly. Allison  being an elementary school teacher  is learning everything she possibly can when it comes to the procedures & hoops one must go through to access help within the government & local systems. She is continuously informing others on how & where to get help & support despite her own family’s tragedy.  Steven & Allison BenderIn the face of the storm  Steve & Zac first raced to assist their neighbors who  on lower ground  were certain to flood as they had years back with Hurricane Floyd. They did indeed flood & their house was submerged all the way to its roof’s eaves. Thankfully  with the help of Steve & Zac  they were at least able to pack a moving van full of belongings.Zac & Allison Bender Then there’s our niece Kim who  instead of worrying about her own personal belongings as the storm rolled in  fought to save 2 Huskies she learned were locked up and abandoned in the bathroom of a house trailer in the community. Along with a friend  she was able to rescue them & with the help of the Pender County Sheriff and Animal Shelter employees  they are alive and well. Kim and Steven Bender Our North Carolina Bender family is without a doubt  a family who believes in “paying it forward” with great love & compassion for others. Regardless of personal circumstances  they always exemplify the phrase  “Love thy neighbor as thyself.”  They have felt blessed and are full of gratitude for everyone who has been volunteering & offering a helping hand to assist them with their immediate needs. We  in turn  would also be extremely grateful for any possible donations  prayers & shares you may be able to contribute. Thank you so very much for taking the time to read this! With great love & gratitude Deanna & Billy Bender,1605,100000,18,2,15,55,7
"Silas, get him back on two feet",https://www.gofundme.com/get-silas-back-on-2-feet,0,Victoria,BC,Silas has had quite the year! On October 5  2017  he severely broke his left leg in a work accident. After spending his 29th birthday eating turkey in the hospital and getting a titanium rod inserted in his tibia to hold it all together  he underwent 10 months of healing. On August 2  2018  things were looking good and he went under the knife once again to get the bolts removed so he could gain more range of motion...normalcy was going to return! Unfortunately 6 days later  he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His same left leg got pinned under a boat keel  weighing a few thousand pounds  that prematurely tipped over and he found himself back in the same emergency room bed: #10. The surgeon had a titanium rod to remove from his leg and a familiar puzzle to put back together  but this left Silas back at square one. Although Silas can keep busy (hopping around on one leg  whittling spoons  and keeping a smile on his face) the time off work and a major set back to getting back to normal has not been ideal. The treatments Silas requires to get back on two feet and live the healthy and active lifestyle he loves are; physio  aqua therapy  osteopathy and a low-intensity ultrasound bone healing stimulator (costs $4K). These are just a few things he will have to pay for and will need a little help from his family and friends.So  let’s help him get back to skipping around as soon as possible and keep him nimble on his leg long term. If you can help  send a little love his way  donate $10 or more today.Let’s give this guy a break.,2045,8810,31,23,22,28,7
Keisha Y. Brown Angel Wings Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/keisha-y-brown-angel-wings-fund,1,MOUNTPLEASANT,MI,Keisha Brown: mother  wife  friend  athlete  coach  and warrior  inspired everyone who had the privilege of knowing her. Keisha played college basketball at Tulane University  where she is the only player in school history to score over 1 000 points and secure over 1 000 rebounds. She is forever enshrined in the Tulane University Athletics Hall of Fame. As a Coach  she led the Sacred Heart Academy Boys Basketball team from 2003-2009. In 2006 the Sacred Heart Irish won second place in the state basketball playoffs  and during her tenure  the Irish had a 114-30 record. She later coached at Alma College for five years. Beyond the hardwood  Keisha was a dedicated mother  wife  friend  and community member. She moved to Mt. Pleasant  Michigan in 2000 where she met her eventual husband  Damon Brown. The two soon welcomed their daughter Angel into the world. A year after Angel’s birth  in June of 2007  Keisha was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her biggest concern was taking care of her daughter  which eventually led Keisha to create the Angel Wings Fund. This Fund provides financial aid to families with a loved one who is battling cancer. It also provides scholarships to students at Sacred Heart Academy  Central Michigan University  and Alma College  who are part of a family that has been impacted by cancer. During Keisha’s battle with cancer  she continued to coach at Sacred Heart Academy and later Alma College. Not once did she miss a game or even a practice  despite countless four-hour trips to and from Chicago for treatment. In April of 2014  after an arduous seven-year battle  Keisha entered into her eternal home with the Lord. Keisha was always determined to ensure that her legacy would be more than just basketball. And through the countless lives she changed and through the Angel Wings Fund  her spirit is alive and well in the community that loved her so much. To quote the late ESPN broadcaster  Stuart Scott: “When you die  it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live  why you live  and the manner in which you live.”Keisha lived her life in a way that never allowed cancer to win. She lived it on her own terms and did not let her affliction dictate what she could and could not do. Even after her passing  the fund she started is allowing the fight against cancer to continue. Every year  Sport Management Students at Central Michigan University host a fundraising event for the benefit of The Angel Wings Fund. This year  a 3v3 Basketball tournament will be held and all proceeds from the “Box Out Breast Cancer” Tournament and this donation page will go directly to the Angel Wings Fund  where it will be used to help those fighting cancer daily here in the Central Michigan Community.

HELP TERESA FIGHT CANCER,https://www.gofundme.com/b9hjxh-help-teresa-fight-cancer,0,DOWNEY,CA,Dear Friends & Family As you may know  our friend Teresa was diagnosed with Breast Cancer and is currently scheduled to receive surgery as treatment. She is looking ahead to receive radiation therapy in the near future  but the costs of medical care  coupled with the time necessary to take off work to receive the treatment she needs  have put her in a position where she has to return to work much too soon after the surgery to save up enough money to pay bills before she can receive radiation. If you’ve ever met Teresa  you know she’s one of the hardest working people you’ll ever meet. She works long  difficult hours  but always manages to put a smile on her customers’ faces  no matter what kind of trials and tribulations she may be going through herself. In all honesty  she didn’t even want to start a GoFundMe in the first place  because she’s a proud  independent  extremely strong person who would never ask for a handout. But those of us who know her and care about her understand that she absolutely deserves the time to heal from surgery and receive whatever treatment is necessary without the additional hardship of returning to work before she’s fully healed  which is why we pushed for this campaign.Please consider donating whatever you can to help aid her costs and soften her recovery in this difficult time. Any little bit helps! Teresa’s health and happiness are extremely important to so many of us  and we want to make sure she is able to fully recover. We know with her strength and will  she’ll come back swinging once she’s had enough time to get better.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Please re-post and share away!!-Teresa’s Family & Friends,215,1000,11,22,5,36,7
That&apos;s What Friends Are For ...,https://www.gofundme.com/rally-around-pangie-and-her-girls,8,Langley,BC,This past weekend  our best friend’s life was changed forever. Pangie Mattheakis lost her husband Michael suddenly and unexpectedly when he passed away in Arizona  USA. Two years ago  the Mattheakis family invested their life savings into purchasing a neglected business in Arizona  in the hopes of turning it around. Plans changed very quickly. A few months later  Pangie found out she had stage 3C Ovarian Cancer while in Vancouver. She immediately started chemotherapy and treatments while Michael was left to take care of the business by himself. Pangie finished her treatments and the family was reunited in Arizona at Christmas 2017 after being apart for 9 months.Pangie and Angelica remained in Canada to be close to her oncologist and physician. They lived with her daughter  Sophia  so Angelica could continue to attend her first year of high school. Sophia remained in Vancouver working full-time to help her family where she could  while Pangie worked on getting her health back. Pangie was in Arizona visiting Michael this past summer and returned to Vancouver for her follow-up scans  only to find out that the cancer had returned. Sophia then quit her job at the beginning of September in order to go to Arizona and help her dad with his business. After being there for only one week  on September 29th  2018 Michael collapsed and died suddenly due to a pulmonary aneurysm. Sophia was at his side but despite best efforts of paramedics nothing could be done to save him. Thankfully  he was not alone. It was a complete shock and has caused extreme trauma to the family. Michael leaves behind his wife  Pangie  and 2 children  Sophia and Angelica  who are devastated by their tragic and unexpected loss. We are trying to help ease the unimaginable pain and burden that Pangie and her daughters are going through by starting this page. They are in the process of bringing Michael back to his final resting place in Surrey and are incurring overwhelming costs for the funeral and legal expenses. In lieu of flowers  please consider making a monetary donation to assist the family in their time of need. Even if you can’t give  please share this link so that we can reach everyone who is able to support them. Rest in peace  Michael. Thank you for helping our dear friend Pangie! Much love  Pangie’s PeepsAll funds will be transferred from Go Fund Me to Pangie and her family to support her during this difficult time.,13365,10000,24,134,94,207,7

A few amazing Samaritans broke the door down to remove Omiis unconscious body from the smoke filled room.Fire has taking everything from my mom but the clothing on her back  her dog and her car! Omii and her need everything to start over and keep them both comfortable during this awful time.My mom is currently without a home and is in 3 day temporary housing at a hotel. Omii is currently seeking medical attention at VCA Vancouver Animal Emergency & Referral Centre. Omii is conscious currently but obvious signs of discomfort  lethargy and lung damage are present. Omii is an Addison patient and is required a daily medication and special diet to keep him comfortable. This can increase complications with the care.As far as cost goes  We have currently been quoted 2800$ (high end) for a one night stay and treatment. This will increase with further treatment.Main focus right now is Omiis health and finding a permanent or temporary resistance for the both of them.

Thank you @brotherRacheed for allowing him to come and share his testimony in your program  he was such an encouragement to me and for all who heard his story of love and devotion to our Lord Jesus in-spite of all the challenges he is facing. His story is a story of transformation and love that is evident in his life. He was diagnosed with stage 5 pancreatic cancer and as of July 2018 doctors have given 6 months to live. Brother Mehrez has been shepherding a local house church in Tunisia for the last few years and is married and has 3 small children. I believe @BrotherRacheed made it clear that as believers we ought to pray for healing and comfort for Mehrez and his precious family  and to also help financially and to come alongside him and his family during this time of great need. Your generosity will be such a blessing to brother Mehrez and will surely encourage him knowing that he has a large family that cares about him and his family.

In recovery back surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/7xhbh7-the-nguyen-family,0,FORTWORTH,TX,We are The Nguyen Family. My name is Diane and my husbands name is Peter. We have 4 beautiful children ages (5 7 9&13) and married 8yrs. We have fallen on hard times. I am not the type to put my business out like this but my family and I need the help.                                                      Mahatma Ghandhi Said                  “If you don't ask  you don't get it.” My husband injured his back a few months back. (Did not get hurt on the job in July) Herniated disc and pinched nerve. His disc 4 and 5 are all kinds of messed up. He was out of work for two whole months. One Income for a family of six is not sufficient. We’ve asked for temporary assistance from the state and we were denied. His short term disability was just recently denied and his FMLA was denied. BUT we were told it can take up to six whole months for them to Approve. It is also up to them to decide if he gets a certain amount of days they will pay him as well. We are still having to file paper work almost every two weeks. If he doesn’t continue therapy or any treatment his FMLA will be denied indefinitely And there is a possibility the company will terminate him. At this point I don’t care for him to receive the short term disability check. I just want him to get better and be able to keep his job.Medical bills have piled up and physical therapy is not cheap  even with insurance. “Meet your deductible” and your co-pay will be less. By that time we have run out of money. The medical bills alone are more than $5000 as of right now. My husband is going in for his second round of steroid injections October 11 and we are praying it works this time. Our last option would be surgery. I am only asking for enough to pay the minimum of everything  for my husbands medical bills  so he can continue therapy and all his medical needs. This way my income would cover our necessities such as keep a roof over our family’s head  food on the table  to keep the lights on and water running.  I also attend school full time (going for my BSN) and work full time. I chose not to drop out of school because I already paid for the classes and books  plus we are half way through the semester. So please DONT judge me for not dropping out of school. I do miss work or school on occasions when my husband needs therapy or is in too much pain. I’ve done my very best to financially hold my family down on my own and I am absolutely exhausted. But I WILL NOT give up! I have also tried every place for payday loans high or low interest you name it! I was not able to get anything. We don’t have many friends or family  but I do pray people find it in their hearts to help. SO PLEASE SHARE THIS POST! Any dollar amount donation is a blessing. All proceeds will go to medical bills only. May GOD Bless you all! Cash app is $VDianeNguyen PayPal and Zelle is vanhkham.nguyen@my.tccd.eduPeter had a follow up appointment with his neurologist last Thursday November 1st and now he is scheduled for surgery December 3. I have recently dropped out of school since Peter can’t stand or sit for long periods of time at work without having tremendous pain. We are still fighting with HR about his short term disability as well. Which I believe they are waiting until after his surgery to approve. As of right now he is on sick leave with no income. I have also tried to reapply for emergency assistance which was denied twice already so maybe since he is scheduled for surgery I might be able to get a little help from the state. We are grateful for what we have received with donations so far but now I am hoping to reach our goal before his surgery. I pray you all find it in you’re hearts to help even if it is a $1. With every view and $1 donation it will help us reach our goal. Please keep our family in you’re prayers and please pray over my husband and his surgeons. God bless you all.,1155,5000,12,23,20,128,7

Dena Fights Lung Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/dena-fights-lung-cancer,1,SANDIEGO,CA,Our family is heartbroken to learn that Dena Davison has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She is  like any mother the backbone of our family. She is a loving wife  an incredible mother and if you ask her  most importantly a beloved grandma or 'Dede' to her beautiful grandbabies. We found out that she has aggressive small cell lung cancer 6 weeks ago when she experienced pain in her stomach and was rushed to the hospital only to discover that it was lung cancer that has metastasized to her adrenal gland and her brain. Unfortunately  the only treatment option available for this type of cancer is chemotherapy. Very strong and very expensive chemotherapy. The treatments have taken her out of work and the medical bills have already started rolling in. With everything she has done for her family  all we want to do is be able to help with what we can so she can focus on the fight against cancer rather than the fight to stay in her home. Thank you for taking the time to read our story and we greatly appreciate  anything that is donated. Everything we raise will go towards keeping Dena comfortable in her home and to help pay for treatments.,2995,10000,8,30,36,378,7

Thankfully he's had life saving surgery to remove the tumor. Unfortunately time wasnt on his side. The tumor was so close to a main artery  Dad couldnt wait to go through the public system. Dad was seen by a private surgeon to get the tumor removed immediately to prevent the cancer spreading. As this has all happened so quickly  the cost is too much to handle. This will leave Dad in more debt than he can afford. As Dad progresses through to chemotherapy he will need all the financial help he can to ease the burden. Anything at all to reduce the cost will be much appreciated. We dont want money issues to cause stress and get in the way of Dad healing and being ready to walk his youngest daughter down the aisle.

Lewis Family Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/lewis-accident-recovery-baby-fund,8,Abbotsford,BC,We have created this campaign with the express purpose of raising funds for Jamie and Crystal to help them and their unborn baby through this devastating time in their lives.Jamie Lewis was critically injured in a single-vehicle accident at approximately 8:00 pm September 27 just outside of Peterborough  Ontario. It took firefighters over an hour to free him from the wreckage  the injuries he sustained were so severe that they rushed him via air ambulance to St Michaels in Toronto in an attempt to save his life. He remained unresponsive until very recently.As I write this Jamies condition is still very precarious but seemingly improving   his vitals are normalizing ever so slightly and he has gained consciousness for a few minutes a handful of times in the last couple of days. Make no mistake Jamie is still fighting for his life and this fight is going to be a long one  he and Crystal will need the support of their friends and family more than ever in the intervening months. It follows that Jamie will be unable to work for the next few months in the best case scenario as he is still far from stable  the worst case scenario would without a doubt devastate this young family emotionally and financially. With that hardship in mind  I would ask that you please find it within your heart to donate any amount you can to help provide financial relief for Jamie  Crystal and their unborn child.  https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/news-story/8931524-man-critically-injured-after-pickup-truck-hits-tree-in-selwyn-township/,4255,10000,14,43,30,144,7

Give a hand to shippa (Troy Selim),https://www.gofundme.com/give-a-hand-to-shippa-troy-selim,0,BentleighEast,VIC,Hey everybody.As some of you are aware  our good friend and champion of a human Shippa hurt his back playing football about 2 months ago. Since then he has not been able to work or do anything at all really. He has been stuck in bed pretty much for the last few months and finally had surgery on his back to try and fix that but unfortunately there were some complications and ended up in the icu for 48 hours and then had to have another surgery to help fix what was going on in there. Shippa is now at rehab and is on the mend but he has a tough road ahead of him. With the help of his family and friends I’m sure he will make a quick and speedy recovery.... now obviously since he hurt his back he hasn’t been able to work so he has had no money coming in to help with anything from medical costs to insurance to car repayments and every other day to day expenses us adults have to deal with. So I thought I would start this page so we might be able to get a bit of money together for the great man and help out with the financial side of things while he concentrates on his recovery.... any money you can spare would be greatly appreciated... Shippa hates to make people worry and hates all the attention but I know if it was me in his position he would be doing the exact same thing and probably more to help me out so please give generously.he is probably going to hate me for making this but I’m sure he will appreciate it in the long run.love ya big fella get better soon xoxo,4060,4000,20,101,44,128,7

Medical expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/jdxpy-medical-expenses,7,NEWPORTNEWS,VA,I have experienced several serious medical conditions that have led to high expenses. I have attempted to cover these expenses with every means available  and not always making the wisest choices; however  I now find myself out of avenues and unable to pay rent. Medical Specialists  numerous medications  and medical devices are all very costly yet very necessary. I am truly at the end of my rope without a net. I find myself not able to shop at a grocery store fully  because of the severe strain  often eating less than healthy because of the cost. I internalize so much so that others will not see the truth and the urgency of the situation. I am embarrassed and humbled to put my reality out there  but also grateful for any assistance that can be given. Blessings to all.,400,2000,22,20,7,18,7
Help Rebuild A Home - Fire,https://www.gofundme.com/life-in-flames,2,HOLLYWOOD,FL,While asleep our home caught fire due to an unknown electrical problem  we barely made it out alive (myself and my daughter). I ran out of my home for my life in only a T-shirt. We are so lucky to be alive; we almost didn't even wake up... Now  we have nowhere to live  no clothes and no food. Unfortunately  everything we have worked so hard for in our entire life went up in flames. We also lost all of our 7 pets  beloved 2 dogs (Miko and Lola)  4 cats (Whitey  Ashi  Kirito  & Deku) and a fish (Jeffrey). This was such a devastating moment  truly heartbreaking to not only lose our poor helpless animals but all our belongings.I am a very devoted family woman. There is nothing I love more than spending time with my kids in my home. I've lived at my home for many years raising my youngest daughter  who is now in college pursuing her studies in Arts. She is a true artist! All her drawings that she had completed over the years and got so many awards for have been destroyed. She has to go back to school with nothing  no clothes  no books  art supplies for her classes...NOTHING! To watch her in such pain devastates me.  I did not have home insurance  so I cannot start there.  The house was demolished  and I would love to rebuild so I can continue to provide a home for her. Any amount is gratefully appreciated! Anything that will help us restore our life and rebuild our home.  Everything helps and is extremely APPRECIATED.

Please help me change my life,https://www.gofundme.com/bcdsar-please-help-me-change-my-life,0,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,Hello.  My name is Dan Scharbrough.  I'm asking for your help in raising funds to purchase a handicapped drive-able vehicle  so that I can get to work  doctor and therapy appointments on time.On February 27th  2018  I fell backwards  20 feet  down a flight of stairs.  I broke three ribs  suffered a spinal cord injury at the T11-T12 vertebrae  and hit my head on a concrete block wall  causing two brain bleeds.  So  a spinal cord injury and two brain injuries at once.  It's not an exaggeration to say that I'm lucky to be alive.As you can imagine  this has completely up-ended my life.  For the first couple of weeks after the accident  I was pretty much immobile.  Then  the therapists at the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana started working on me.  And  I started to get some movement back in my legs.  I now have quite a bit of movement back  and I can stand for short times.  My doctors do think that I will be able to walk again  with the aid of a walker or a cane  but I will never be back at 100%.  And I will always need my wheelchair to get along for any distance.My life prior to the accident was an active one.  For 25 years  I was a high school football official in Indiana  spending my autumn Friday nights under the lights  running up and down a football field.  For almost 40 years  I have worked as an actor  in stage plays  TV commercials  and a scattering of bit parts in films.  I was a 28 year member of the professional union for actors  Actors Equity Association.  I did 46 productions at Beef & Boards Dinner Theater in Indianapolis.  I have worked for the past 26 years as a member of the Safety Patrol at The Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400 (that's me just over driver Kenny Brack's head in Victory Circle holding the Borg-Warner trophy on his car in 1999).  My wife and I were very active with our grandson.  And I'm trying to get some of that independence back  trying to retrieve as much of my life prior to February 27th of this year as I can.I would like to purchase a handicapped drive-able vehicle so that I will not have to rely on  and use the local  Indianapolis  IN based  IndyGo Open Door Paratransit Bus Service.  This service is poorly managed  poorly routed  and the buses are always late  sometimes as much as an hour to an hour and a half.  I am constantly late to work  doctor and therapy appointments  sometimes having to reschedule them because they have been cancelled because I am so late  thereby taking even more time away from work  and not being paid for that time.  I have provided a link below to a news story done by WTHR Channel 13 Indianapolis.  This is an investigative report detailing the major problems that myself and other riders have experienced.  This was produced by Cyndee Hebert and the reporting is done by Bob Segall. https://www.wthr.com/article/13-investigates-indygo-bus-service-keeps-disabled-riders-waiting-riding-hours I could sit at home and collect a disability check  but I don't want to do that.  I want to work  to be engaged  to perform a job that helps me contribute to my family  and gives me some self-esteem.  I need a vehicle that I can drive so I can be on time to work  and the other appointments that this injury requires me to have  so I don't have to rely on a completely unreliable bus to make me late to everything.  And  I want to take some of the pressure off of my wife.  She is now loading and unloading my chair onto a trailer that we haul with her van whenever we go anywhere...in the sun  nighttime  rain  and soon in the snow.  And I want to drive my own vehicle to lessen her burden.  She has been nothing short of absolutely amazing in this whole process.  It’s not hyperbole to say that without her  I’d be a dead man.My research shows that I can purchase a vehicle like I need for approximately $30 000 to $60 000  depending upon if it's pre-owned or new.  Vocational Rehabilitation  an Indiana state agency that works with the disabled community with help in finding employment  housing  work place compliance  home adaptability and many other issues  will pay for the vehicle to be adapted to me and my wheelchair  as well as the driving classes that will train me to drive the vehicle and be certified with the state of Indiana DMV.Of course  I would love to be able to purchase and have a vehicle modified as soon as possible  but I certainly understand this process  and realize that a Go Fund Me page is a bit of a long shot.  So I will just rely on the generosity of you good folks  and anything that I receive here will go toward the purchase of a vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to take a look at this  and if you donate at all  Thank You for your generosity. Sincerely Dan ScharbroughIndianapolis  IN,13655,35000,18,39,199,740,7

Harvest Kindness,https://www.gofundme.com/harvest-kindness,7,WATERFORD,VA,*** UPDATE: Between the GoFundMe and the Harvest Kindness Event we held this weekend  we have met our goal of $20 000!!!  Trying to figure out how to show this on the GoFundMe page  but in the mean time  wanted to make sure everyone knew.   THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR THEIR GENEROSITY AND SUPPORT!!! ****In 2013 Fernando and Jan Mathov purchased a property in Waterford  VA to start their dream of owning a vineyard and joining the local Loudoun wine community.  Jan was to be an integral part of managing the vineyard.  Then in 2014 Jan had an accident on the property in which she sustained a spinal cord injury  leaving her an incomplete quadriplegic.  Jan currently borrows a friend’s Track Chair when it’s available. It is a specialty wheelchair that allows Jan to safely maneuver the muddy fields.  As the vines grow and mature  Jan needs her own Track Chair so she will have the freedom to give her vineyard the time and attention it needs to thrive.   The new chair would also enable her to and stand up to tend the upper canopy protecting the grapes.  The goal is to raise the $20 000 needed to purchase the Track Chair in time for the start of the 2019 growing season.   In addition to this fundraiser  the great folks at the Wine Reserve at Waterford are also planning a Harvest Kindness Event on November 10  at Northgate Winery from 7- 9 pm. There will be food  wine  live music and prizes. Tickets are just $25 and include a commemorative wine glass  glass of wine at the event  and raffle ticket. Purchase your ticket at the Wine Reserve at Waterford tasting room or online at  https://www.townvu.com/winereserveatwaterford/ordering .  The Harvest Kindness initiative celebrates our local wine community and gives thanks for another growing season by paying it forward to someone in need.  We sincerely thank you for your support!!!,20000,20000,20,100,59,174,7
Help My Veteran Fight Rare Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-my-veteran-fight-rare-cancer,1,OWEN,WI,This page has been created by Lucinda Ingersoll in order to help John fight a rare cancer. John Burch was diagnosed in August with a rare form of cancer called Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma. This type makes up approximately 2% of all cancers  and has a history of metastasizing to the lungs. Unfortunately  the tumor was deemed inoperable due to it's size and location  and John was sent elsewhere. Since that time  we have been to several locations and had many scans. We did receive some hope from another surgeon  and were even given details about a possible surgery. A road trip was made  and work was missed. After several more days of tests and scans  the second opinion was shot down  and the tumor again deemed inoperable. This second blow was again devastating  but we are now seeking out more treatment options  to include radiation.We need your help. Costs for travel  overnight stays  loss of work  and medical costs that are not covered by insurance are adding up very quickly. This diagnosis was an emotional shock for us  and is only compounded by financial stress.John & I have been together for seven years  and have found finally found true Love in one another.

Connor&apos;s Road to Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/connor039s-road-to-recovery,5,Keswick,ON,On 10-01-2018  we got the phone call that made time stand still. My brother  Connor Cooper (25) was in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident on his way to work. He was cut off by someone driving a utility / construction tractor with no indicators  lights or signage marked. The driver fled on foot  and the suspect is still at large.Connor was in a critical state. His right femur and knee had an open compound fracture; some bone and his kneecap were missing somewhere on the road at the scene. The tendons and ligaments completely torn away. Left wrist is badly fractured and in a solid cast  along with his right wrist which is also fractured. Right hand  ring finger was lacerated and crushed between the first and second joints  they could not save that  it is gone.  There are other minor injuries  along with lacerations and bruises. That is all I will be explaining in regards to his injuries at this time.We are extremely thankful for the trauma team  doctors  surgeons and all the nurses at Sunnybrook Hospital  ensuring that he has a second chance. As of this moment  Connor is slowly recovering in hospital and is gently making progress. The accident creates a very immense impact on his life  he has many obstacles to face (not alone) on this long journey. He will be facing further surgery  and extended time in rehab down the road. Despite this  he has extremely high spirits.Connor is my big brother. He is known as a brother to many others  and he is always there to give the shirt off his back when needed.I have hopes that this Go Fund Me page will ease some of his financial strain that he is faced with upon leaving the hospital to come home; as we are unsure of when that will be down the road. There are things that will be necessities that are not covered  which will need to be taken care of as well. He has worked unbelievably hard for his motorcycle and cars which are what keeps him happy. He will not be able to bounce back easily. The future is very uncertain right as to when he will be able to return to work  if at all in his current position and I want to ensure I can do everything possible to make things less stressful and accessible for him.Any relief is greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed. I have never requested aid like this before and this is very new to me  I just know we need help and support. Please share this with your network  friends and family and help us help Connor get through this challenging time.Thank you all for your calls  texts  e-mails and direct messages.If anyone needs to contact my family  please contact myself at cassidy_cooper@hotmail.comPlease refrain from contacting John  Kim or Connor.

Devastating loss,https://www.gofundme.com/uwjtwf-devastating-loss,2,NEEDVILLE,TX,On September 28 our home was consumed by fire. This home was my grandparents which we purchased from them prior to our marriage in 1978.  This has been our home for almost 40 years.  Unfortunately we had no insurance.  We have also recently gotten news that my husband has been placed on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.  We were overjoyed at that news but have been overwhelmed and heartbroken with the fire.  We cannot not do both of these major life events alone.  We have been blessed that no one was injured in the fire and our daughter Melissa and her husband Keith have taken care of not only Waymond and I but also our daughter Amanda.   We have been able to sift through and find a few family treasures...but we will have a tough road ahead of us. We would appreciate any help at all.  If you cannot donate please keep us in your prayers.  I have found strength in the prayers and know that God is watching over us.,3505,10000,11,35,34,229,7

Help Brian Battle this BEAST,https://www.gofundme.com/help-brian-battle-this-beast,0,PORTLAND,TN,"I am seeking funds for my dear friend Brian Lance and his family as they brace for his treatment for a recently discovered brain tumor (Glioblastoma).  Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of Brain Cancer that there is and...There is no cure!  You can read about this online if you want to understand more about this BEAST.  Brian and his wife Charlene along with their only daughter Haylie (13 years old) are having to face the reality that Brian will have to face treatment for the rest of his life.We are all trying to wrap our minds around the events of this past week therefore  this post may be lengthly.  It is my prayer and hope that you will read until the end so that you can understand just how fast this has happened as well as the shock that it has created.  This will help you to understand the need as well.Brian began having some episodes a few months ago....Memory and headaches. Then this past couple weeks the occasional episodes became more and more frequent. Brian being the man and caretaker that he is  did not want to burden his family with these episodes and mostly kept it to himself. Brian’s doctor had him scheduled to see a Neurologist in Bowling Green  KY on December 3rd. Fast forward to last Wednesday (9/26/18) when Brian called Charlene and explained to her that these episodes were more than just headaches and that he had two episodes within a matter of hours and knew that something was not right and that he felt it was time to see a specialist.Charlene went straight into superwoman wife mode and began calling Neurologists to see what she could get done.  Charlene found a Neurologist that could see Brian on October 11th.  Charlene took this appointment because it was the best date that she had found. Then a miracle happens....while on the phone scheduling the appointment for October the 11th  the lady on the other end of the line says \we just had a cancellation for tomorrow\""...\""WOW right?\""So Thursday (9/27/18) Brian and Charlene go to the neurology appointment.  The neurologist immediately takes action after listening to Brian explain his symptoms and gets him an MRI scheduled for 12:30pm that same day. Friday (9/28/18) Brian  Charlene and Cheryl (Charlene’s sister and Best Friend) go back to see the neurologist to get the results of the MRI  which they know aren't going to be good after seeing the images of his brain on CD.  The doctor confirms that Brian has a brain tumor and suspects that it is Glioblastoma.  Surgery will be needed ASAP.Keep in mind that Brian  Charlene  Haylie  Cheryl  and her husband Gary have had a trip to Disney planned for Haylie’s fall break for almost a year.  They were to fly out on Monday (10/01/18).  The doctor tells them not to cancel the trip and that Brian needs to make these memories with his dear family while he can.  Charlene immediately wants to cancel the trip and do what is best for Brian but Brian knows how much they wanted to go and he insists that they all still go  himself included.  Brian wanted to go for his family and especially for Haylie!The neurologist continues to work quickly and got Brian scheduled to see a neurosurgeon in Nashville  TN (Dr. Abram).  Monday (10/01/18) Charlene  Haylie  Cheryl and Gary fly out to Disney as scheduled. Brian stays behind to meet with the neurosurgeon on Tuesday morning (10/02/18) and is scheduled to fly out at 1:30pm to meet the family. Tuesday (10/02/18) the family heads to the park for the day.  Of course  they are worried sick about Brian but are also trying to make this a great day for Haylie.  Charlene’s parents take Brian to the appointment with the neurosurgeon as he has been told that he is not allowed to operate a vehicle until further notice due to the seizures he is experiencing from the tumor. After this appointment Charlene’s parents are planning to take Brian to the airport so that he can go and join the family because they had planned to keep this trip as scheduled per the recommendation of the neurologist. They wanted to make this a special experience especially for Brian and Haylie. They had just gotten to Disney  had only been there for a couple hours  just trying to let Haylie have a good time... all the while they were honestly sick... just knowing Brian was at this appointment and would be getting more results. Brian texts Cheryl and asked her to call him when she could get away from Charlene. Cheryl immediately knew that something wasn’t good! From Cheryl \""When I spoke with him  it was so heartbreaking. He of course was holding back tears but also letting them flow too.\""  The neurosurgeon didn’t want Brian to take the trip and wanted to do surgery immediately. The mass was huge... literally shifting half of his brain into the other side.  Surgery is scheduled for the very next day!Cheryl at this point had to tell her sister.  She took Charlene into the bathroom (in one stall) and explained to her what she had just learned all the while trying to console her and keep her composure.  Cheryl: \""thank God for that stall.\""  Of course  they were heading home!Gary (Hero uncle and Brother-in-law) quickly took charge and got all new flights scheduled as well as had Disney there to escort them out of the park the quickest way  within minutes.  Disney was more than accommodating and had a driver ready for them at the exit who drove them back to their condo - off property.  They packed as fast as humanly possible and were headed straight for the airport to get back home to be with Brian. It was as if God has laid everything out for them....  Wednesday (10/03/2018) Brian has surgeryBrian’s Post Surgery Report from Dr. Abram:Surgery began at 2:15pm. Surgery completed at 4:15pm. The tumor was confirmed to be a Glioblastoma Dr. Abram was able to extract all of the tumor to the microscopic level. There was nothing left that was humanly possible to see via MRI. That doesn’t mean every cell of the tumor was removed  it means that all of the cells that could be seen were removed. Further treatment or 2nd and/or 3rd line treatments will be needed as follow up. Dr. Abram doesn’t expect anything other than a temporary deficits of speech or motor skills  even if there are any deficits at all. (There were NONE...Praise the Lord)Dr. Abram stated that with the extraction staying within the tumor and not getting into the brain  there shouldn’t be any long term issues. Dr. Abram did confirm that Brian will NOT be able to drive for 6 at least months (requirement from law enforcement after having the type of seizures he was having). Quote from the Doctor: “There are long term survivors of this type of cancer  why not you?”Friday 10/05/2018 Post-Op AssessmentWe’ve seen a couple doctors this morning from a team of about 15-20. Unfortunately  we found out late last night 10/04/18 that there is an area of the Glioblastoma left in the speech area of the brain and that the initial post-surgery report from the neurosurgeon was not correct in totality. We are sure that the surgeons were also disappointed to know that their wonderful technological report was misleading.  Brian will have to have another procedure.  This area will be addressed with a 3mm laser that will be done in a couple weeks. This should be an out-patient procedure. This area could not be taken out during initial surgery because it would have affected too much. The way they are planning to go in to get it  will be safer and for that we are grateful. Brian will begin oral chemo and radiation in 3 weeks or so. He needs to heal from what he’s been thru already. Radiation will wear him out the most  probably. He’s young though  so it may not. Oral chemo will make him nauseous  but everyone reacts differently. They are waiting to get the exact DNA from his glioblastoma. One type of glioblastoma responds much better to treatment than the other.  We don’t know what DNA his is yet.  Brian’s treatment will be tailored to his DNA.  We are praying his is the one that responds the best. Brian will start with 30 days of radiation. Monday-Friday. Only takes about 30 minutes. Chemo is oral and he will be able to take that at home. Brian is one of the greatest and FUN individuals I have ever known. He did not deserve to have this hit him at such a young age. Brian has always been strong and inspiring  not only for me  but to his many friends and family. He tells everyone that he is going to fight this as hard as he can  saying: \""I am going to kick its A$$!\"" I know he is up for this fight  But...I feel passionately that I need to do something more. I view Brian as a friend and Brother.  Brian has been there for me and my husband time and again.  They share the same name  so we refer to them as \""Loden\"" and \""Lance\""  rather than \""Brian\"" and \""Brian\"" :)  We are all prayed up and prepared to tackle this day by day but in doing so  we also understand that there is a financial need and burden.  I am asking that anyone that can  please donate.  I will answer any questions you have about this fundraiser...but please  please give generously to help Brian's fight!  Time is passing so quickly and your donations will ease the pressure of lost wages and prevent the costs of treatment from becoming an even larger burden to their family. Charlene will likely have to take extensive time off work as well to take care of him.  I assure you that 100% of these proceeds will be transferred immediately to Brian and Charlene’s checking account for immediate relief.  As more needs arise I will do my best to communicate how these funds are being spent. We will continue to keep everyone updated on Brians condition as much as possible!Matthew 19:26 says...But Jesus looked at them and said to them \""With men this is impossible  but with God ALL things are possible.\""I believe that with God  ALL things ARE possible!  This is why I am trusting that those that can  will donate!Thank you so much  in advance   for showing your love for this wonderful man and his family. I assure you that he would always do the same for you!""",3755,25000,11,15,36,249,7

Lolo Strong,https://www.gofundme.com/lolo-strong,1,FORTVILLE,IN,Lauren Hanawalt is a beautiful and intelligent 16-year-old young lady attending Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis  Indiana. Lauren’s nickname is Lolo  which more aptly fits her sweet and kindhearted personality. Lolo loves all animals  but especially her dog  Baxter. And her lovely smile will brighten up any room  day or night. When Lolo was 14  she was diagnosed with uterine cancer and had surgery to remove the tumor. In July 2018  the cancer reoccurred and her doctor recommended treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  Texas  the leading cancer hospital in the U.S. In August  Lolo  her mom  Karen  and aunt  Terry  headed down to Houston for treatment. Lolo’s dad  Doug  is staying back home in Indiana so that he can continue to work and maintain the household. Karen  who is a high school math teacher at Fishers High School in Fishers  Indiana  is taking a leave of absence from teaching so that she can be in Houston with Lolo. Lolo has two older siblings  Sara and Jake. Both Sara and Jake attend Purdue University and have been awesome role models for Lolo. Sara has been able to make two trips to Houston thus far  which really lifted Lolo’s spirits. Lolo’s treatment plan is aggressive and includes chemotherapy  proton beam therapy (radiation)  and surgery. Some days  Lolo has both chemo and radiation. Lolo never complains and is so courageous in dealing with all the treatment protocols  delays  and pain. The current schedule takes them through the end of October  but it could be longer depending on many potential variables. Needless to say  these unplanned direct expenses to the Hanawalt family are outrageous. In addition to the non-reimbursable medical expenses  there are travel and lodging expenses in Houston and potential loss of income. Any monetary donation that you kindly provide will help offset medical  travel  lodging  and other unplanned expenses. Our entire family would like to thank you for reading Lolo’s story and contributing any amount to the fund. Please pray for Lolo  our family and the wonderful health care providers at MD Anderson.,29270,20000,17,146,257,982,7

"Anandaban Leprosy Hospital, Nepal",https://www.gofundme.com/anandaban-leprosy-hospital-nepal,7,Butler,NJ,I have been working at Anandaban Leprosy Hospital in a village  Lele   outside of Kathmandu  Nepal for the last 5 weeks. In such a short time I have fallen in love with this country and the warm hearted people of Nepal: patients  coworkers  neighbors  and friends. The hospital is majorly funded by The Leprosy Mission  a UK based NGO. The hospital is non-profit; many of the patients receive free or very low cost care. The hospital staff work for lower salaries with very limited resources. Before coming here  I knew little about leprosy. I barely knew it was still prevalent. Leprosy is most common in the poorest sectors of local communities. As in many countries  persistent traditional attitudes towards leprosy mean that people with the disease fear the personal  social  and physical consequences. This stigma often leads to being ostracized by the family or  community  losing jobs  etc.; all for a disease that is curable! Delay in diagnosis and treatment  which is common  places the person at risk of developing irreversible nerve impairments affecting sensation and movement  which can lead to disability and deformity. Anandaban Hospital provides diagnosis  treatment  and counseling for leprosy  but also treats general patients in the local villages. There are also specialist services in prosthetics (all made on site)  reconstructive surgery   and treatment for people experiencing complications due to leprosy. The outcomes I have seen are truly amazing! The people affected by the devastating disease of leprosy are somehow the most gracious and kind-hearted people I have ever met!The staff at the hospital is also impeccable. I have learned so much in the short time I have been here so far. They are dedicated to the patients and work with great diligence and care. Since being here I have realized how much I take for granted as a nurse in the US. There is no wasting of supplies here; the issue is that thy need more supplies  and supplies that function well. I would really like to raise some money for the hospital for some simple medical supplies  such as thermometers  blood pressure cuffs  oxygen saturation probes  wound care supplies  materials for prosthetic-making  medications  etc.Any donation would be so greatly appreciated. I am only working here one more month  but I will be in contact with the hospital staff and would keep you informed about what your generous donations have done for Anandaban Leprosy Hospital. Thank you so much!,1825,2500,13,73,23,134,7
Everly&#x2019;s Warrior Princess Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/everlys-warrior-princess-fund,8,Antigonish,NS,As most of you know  my sister Kaitlin Porter and her partner Joel Breen welcomed their 2nd child  Everly Katherine Mae Breen  on Monday  October 1st at the IWK in Halifax  three weeks early. Ms. Everly was born with a congenital heart defect that doctors were hopeful to be able to fix at 6 months  but she took a turn on Tuesday night and surgery was required on Wednesday. Everly is currently resting in the PICU where she continues to fight! She’s got a long road ahead of her. Everly’s parents are required to stay close to the hospital so that if Everly needs them  they can be there within a moments notice. I’m hoping to take some of the financial burden off the family’s shoulders. Please consider donating - no amount is too small! If you unable to donate  please share.,1830,5000,10,37,42,336,7
Kick Cancers Ass!,https://www.gofundme.com/m3fnd-kick-cancers-ass,1,LAKEMARY,FL,After much thought  we have decided to look into other ways to help Nicole and her family to ensure she can continue to fight to kick some cancer ass. For those who know Nicole  you may know how much convincing this took to get her to agree to hosting this campaign (I still don't think she fully agrees  but she has some pretty aggressive friends :D). For those of you are not fortunate know Nicole  there are a few things you need to know before donating to this campaign. Nicole is a mama to four beautiful baby girls  a Cheer mom  a Wife to Joe Defalco  a Manager at her current job (yes  she still continues to occasionally work through all of this...I have no idea how?) and the best friend to many many fortunate people. Her first battle with cancer started earlier this year when Melanoma was discovered and she had to do through a surgery called Wide Excision to remove the Melanoma. We thought she was good to go. Fast forward a few months to May 2018 where it was discovered she had Stage 3C Metastatic Uterine Cancer. The large tumor had spread from her endometrial lining through her uterus and into her cervix and nearby lymph nodes. In June she had a complete hysterectomy to remove all they could and then began her Chemo journey in July. More recently  it was discovered there are additional lymph node and lung involvement which is now being treated with DAILY radiation on top of WEEKLY chemo. Nicole has also tested positive for Lynch syndrome (MSH2) which is a genetic predisposition to cancer  especially colon and uterine cancer. Nicole will need to fight cancer for the rest of her life. Being that she is going through this rigorous treatment  it is near impossible for her to cook dinner  clean her home  care for her family  drive herself or her children to work/school/activities  do braids or ponytails for school pictures  grocery shopping etc. Nicole shouldn't be working and will be forced to stop very soon as the treatments are really taking a toll on her body. She shouldn't be fighting so hard to make money for her family and her medical treatment that she compromising her ability to rest  restore and kick cancers ass.Your contribution to Nicole and her family will give her the chance to not only fight for herself  but also fight for her family and friends. Her children need her and they need us. Many people are asking what they can do to help  this is it. Every penny counts. Every share counts.,4306,10000,9,43,65,607,7
Help Alexis&#x2019; Kidneys,https://www.gofundme.com/kidneybills,4,JOHNSONCITY,TN,With Baby Wallace on the way we specifically decided it was time to reach out to our friends and family. We don’t know where to turn right now and our bills are stacking up from a compressed kidney  to a swollen kidney  to an improperly functioning renal vein. It’s becoming more saddening figuring out how to pay this than it was with the uncertainty of what would happen with Alexis’ kidneys in July and now. Over the weekend our medical debts increased and that isn’t concerning the bills from the most recent hospital stay as they haven’t even come in yet. We are very graciously asking for help for various hospital bills and outpatient treatment that has occurred from July until now. With our bills at $9011 and growing  we have no idea where this will come from. It has put us back so much already that we aren’t successfully able to continue making payments. Some background: Alexis was admitted to three hospitals in July for nauseating pain  a 104 fever and unable to move her right side. Unsure of what was going on  we were fianlly told a kidney infection. After discharge  we found out the medication given to treat at home did not clear up the infection completely and ended up causing two separate infections throughout August. Thinking everything was okay  after being told all white blood count had dropped to normal levels and there were no nitrites in her anymore  we felt confident. Until 14th of September when this time it was the left side. Nauseous  hurting to move and a 102 fever  she was admitted again. Immediately prepped for surgery (which thankfully hasn’t had to happen yet) things started to improve from what they were and she was diagnosed with Acute Pyelonephritis as it had reached the kidneys. With the right side still healing (and close to being normal) and the left side now swollen it has caused a lot of stress and upset in our little family. Not even 24hours after discharge we started getting calls to pay the bills. One slightly over $4000  one $1044  more and more  hospital after hospital  from a radiologist to different techs  for a rare medicine that the hospital had to special order because nothing else was working- the next thing we know it’s pushing $7000. This was July alone. We haven’t even received the bill from September’s stay and it’s terrifying because we know it will be even more since the baby was also accounted for in the treatment. Theres 6 weeks left before the baby is born and we have a whole uncertainty on if this will occur again. At this point we desperately need help and don’t know where else to turn. We are asking for a portion to at least help keep things at bay until the baby comes. We are sad  distraught and just stressed out. Please  please help our family. ￼Miller likes the food ha￼Jensen was happy because she got to hear the baby on the monitor.,2000,4011,17,50,17,66,7

Rachel&apos;s Hit N Run No No Fun,https://www.gofundme.com/67vz4m0,5,AUSTIN,TX,On Thursday night October 4th Rachel was hit by a car while riding her bicycle. The driver made an illegal left turn and hit Rachel head on traveling at a very high speed. Rachel had a green light and the driver failed TO PAY ATTENTION. The driver FAILED TO SEE HER. The driver failed to yield to give her the right of way. The driver failed TO STOP AFTER HITTING HER HEAD ON. The driver made the disgusting decision to flee without rendering aid. They made the decision to flee without waiting for the police to arrive. They fled the scene leaving my sister in the middle of the road BLEEDING. The driver made no attempt to stop. Rachel's injuries are SERIOUS and her recovery process will be long. Luckily  a witness was able to follow the assailant that fled the scene AND was able to aid in getting the license plate number off the car--- 90014F (Honda paper plate). We are lucky and eternally grateful for the help of these Good Samaritans. They witnessed this horrific hit and run and took immediate action to follow the driver who fled. Rachel's journey to recovery is just beginning. As I write this she is in surgery now... any contributions made to this go fund me will be utilized to put Rachel back together. We are extremely lucky she is alive and will recover. Help  in any form  is vital and greatly appreciated. Please pray for Rachel and donate if you are able! Thank you from her family---Melissa and Jessica  Mom and Dad  and Traé ❤️,13890,20000,20,69,129,389,7

She has issues from in her brain  disc issues down her neck and down her spine  severe nerve issue and damage and issues down both arms and legs. Nearly 4 years ago she was forced out of being a Pastry Chef.She started off with forearm crutches 3 years ago  then in Feb 2018 her condition in her brain also gives her really bad paralysis and she broke 4 different bones in her left knee getting out of bed not realizing that both legs were paralyzed. Since the day after that she has been in a wheelchair. Every treatment and every doctor isnt helping. So  we are going to try and go at this from a different direction.

But  we just need help on some of financial part of getting starting. We are going to need 2 big crates (one for her truck  she wont be able to lift in and out every time)  we need some specialized harnesses as he/she get bigger... and bigger. Also  we may need a few shots in a few months and to get the pup fixed.  We have wanted this for her if she falls at home  the dog will be trained to brace to help her up  trained to work with a specialist trainer  trained also to walk with her chair and just so so many plans. Please  if there is anything that you could possibly donate to help us try and make this Mobility Dog a reality for her safety and my sanity while I have to be at work   then you could truly change the course of our family's safety and stress.

"Friend of Doug, please help.....",https://www.gofundme.com/fundraiser-for-doug-chenault,0,MORRILTON,AR,I can breath...   for a long time I’ve depended on you my friends for my next breath.   There were times when I felt like I was gasping for my last breath and one of you would come through with just enough money to get us get us through.  Prayers answered to be sure  I’m so grateful and blessed the good Lord has so many good people to work through to provide for our needs.  God is good and so are so many of you.  Words cannot convey how much we appreciate the love and support we have received during our times of need.   I am happy to say that we now have a steady income flow.  We are not cash rich  but we are so rich in the love we share with the many people that have reached out and embraced us the past several months.   We have grown close to so many people and the relationships we have with so many people are gifts that that are simply invaluable.   We have a steep hill to climb  but we are on our way and we have you to thank for keep us from drowning.   We love you.   Thank you! After a difficult few months toward the end of the year  2018 ended on a positive note with many blessings received.  Thank you so much for your prayers and support.  Doug  his family and I personally thank you so very much!!!!   In the words of John Lennon  he has gotten by with a little help from his friends.  I want to remind you that his needs continue and ask that you please continue to support him going forward.By the grace of God and the power of prayer  Doug spent the holiday with his growing family.  The gifts may have been fewer and smaller  but the time spent together was more precious and special  the love shared was more abundant and meaningful.   We never know how much we love someone until faced with the prospect of losing them or actually losing them.  Live each day as if it is the last because it just might be...I hate to but I must ask you for help again.  2019 comes with more financial challenges for Doug.  He is still unable to work due to the blockage in his brain.  He filed for Disability but is likely at least 2 months away for any financial support from that.  As we all experienced  Jan. 1 started with new deductibles.  With his medical conditions  this is hitting him hard due to his many medications  doctor visits and medical tests.   This is in addition to simple day-to-day living expenses.  Please help if you can.  And again  thank you to those that have already given  you are so appreciated.  Sincerely Big Al For any that are are not aware of the background on Doug's condition  please see below:_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________11/14/18 My very best friend of more than 50 years  Doug Chenault needs our help.  He has 100% blockage in a major artery that supplies blood to his brain  as you can see below. As challenging as this situation is he has just recently lost his job. I'm hearing now that his heart doctor is concerned about his blood pressure issues. It looks as if this may require some additional test to see if they can determine what's going on. Once again as you can read below he's dealing with a blockage in a main artery that feeds the brain  which makes this blood pressure issue very concerning. He's doing his best not to be stressed  which only aggravates everything  but right now it must seem like the weight of the world is resting on his shoulders. I want to thank all of you that have helped thus far and for those that would consider helping. God Bless!   Big Al On September 4th  Doug had pain in his left hand that soon led to his whole left side starting to feel strange.   He went to the ER at St. Vincent Hospital where he was immediately taken back for testing and admitted later that evening.  He spent 5 days in the NSICU.  They found that Doug had a mini-stroke. During his hospital stay  several MRI and CT scans uncovered very a dangerous and serious issue that could have proven deadly had it not been found.  His condition is still very serious.  Doug's Basilar artery is completely blocked.   The blockage has been determined to be inoperable due to the high danger of a massive stroke  or worse.  By the grace of God  he has some oversized arteries that are working extra hard and his body has even generated new arteries to supply blood to his brain.  They are treating him with medications to reduce the risk of further clotting and keeping his blood pressure high to help push adequate blood flow to his brain.  The high blood pressure causes other complications for the heart  eyes and other body parts.  It’s an extraordinary balancing act that requires a team of specialized physicians working together.Due to the high cost of medical treatment and loss of income Doug is in need of your prayers and financial assistance if possible.  I am asking you for any help you can provide for this man and his family that means so much to me.  Please help me  help him!  Thank you Big Al,10285,25000,24,41,77,178,7
Help Liz with Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/help-liz-with-medical-expenses,0,GENTRY,AR,I’m starting this fund-raiser for my Aunt Liz because she’s the type of person who won’t ask for help even when she’s truly in need. On October 25th  Liz is having a double knee replacement. Although she has health insurance (thankfully)  as anyone who has had major surgery knows  the actual medical costs are only a fraction of the expenses associated with such an event.  Not only has she had to make expensive modifications to her home to accommodate her anticipated lack of mobility  she is looking at a prolonged recovery time which will significantly affect her income. I am hoping that we can raise enough money to help offset the financial burden that she is simply not prepared to absorb.Often when we see fundraisers  we wonder if the person is truly in need or is “deserving” enough. I’ve known more than one person in legitimate need  yet this is the first fundraiser I’ve ever done. I feel compelled to do this for Liz because I know she won’t give herself the honest credit she deserves. One of the most generous and supportive individuals I know  she is always helping and lifting others up. Whether it be time  encouragement  technical ability  knowledge  or even financial assistance  when Liz encounters another in need  she gives. I know this first hand. After my mom passed away  I was a recipient of Liz’s kindness and compassion. Knowing how devastated and lost I would be  my mom had designated her as the Trustee of her estate. She knew she could count on Liz for the time-consuming and onerous tasks of handling her final wishes. Liz not only handled the estate manners  but gave hours of her personal time to go above and beyond the role of Trustee. She made what was an overwhelming and confusing time  manageable. I was numb and shell-shocked. Normal tasks were beyond my capabilities. Had it not been for Liz  I don’t think I would have been able to continue providing care to my grandma and uncle  and then weathering my grandma’s passing too. Never once did she balk at handling what “should” have been within my capabilities and were legitimately my responsibility. She knew I was hurting and she was there  physically  emotionally  and spiritually. That’s just the type of person she is. Since my mom’s passing  I’ve gotten much closer to her. I’ve seen again and again  Liz act without consideration for her own needs  and never with an expectation of a return  help many people.One of the challenges posed to Liz is that she’s an extremely self-sufficient and capable woman. She forged a path in authenticity and self-realization long before it was fashionable. She’s a veteran  a blackbelt  she scuba dives  she rides a motorcycle…. she’s tough! It seems inconceivable that she actually needs help. I’m concerned that many of her friends are unaware of her need for assistance  because in most of her circles  she is THE support person. I’ve seen time and time again certain individuals always giving  but when they need help  there are few offers of assistance. I don’t think it’s out of malice or intentional thoughtlessness  it’s just because that person is so capable and self-reliant  the thought of them being otherwise is simply unimaginable.She’s definitely facing a challenge she can’t surmount on her own. Although she needs actual physical support as well  she resides in a different state. I can’t help with that. But I can help her financially  and am hoping and praying that those she has helped in the past  will be encouraged to do so as well. The financial burdens I touched on earlier are real. As an entrepreneur  her income is directly reliant upon her time  something she will not have for several weeks  extending into months. Additionally  she is already facing increased expenses and is anticipating many more. Simple things like transportation  errands  meal preparation  pet care  and home and yard maintenance will need to be hired out. She will have physical help with some of it  but I know it’s impractical to assume that her friends and family will be able to provide all of this support  particularly when one considers their support system (Liz) will be out for the count. She isn’t the type of person to ask either. If she doesn’t have the resources to procure these services  she’ll either go without or injure herself trying to do it on her own. I don’t want to see that. I also don’t want to see this giving soul  who is always taking care of others  feeling as though her genuine support is not reciprocated. I’m praying her kindness is returned to her and that she is shown the same support she has shown many others. Thank you so much for reading my request  much love!!!,1646,4000,12,41,19,121,7

Dr. Quinn and her staff from Burtchville Veterinary Clinic did everything they could to save her  but she inhaled too much smoke and wasn't able to recover from it.In order for Sheri & Charlie Paws  her only surviving furbaby  to be able to return to their home  there are many things that have to be done to the structure  including but not limited to  rebuilding the kitchen from the walls out  professional cleaning of all walls  ceilings  ducts as well as replacement of doors  windows  floor coverings  draperies  appliances and furniture. Sheri had a small renter's policy  but sadly Jim didn't have a homeowner policy  which would normally pay for the structural repairs. We are asking that you see it in your heart to help out Jim & Sheri  40+ year friends  with the expenses of the above mentioned repairs  so that Sheri & Charlie Paws can return to their beloved home. Thank you so very much. We are certain that Sheri  Jim & Charlie will appreciate every gesture.,1727,10000,11,17,17,122,7
We need help with our cancer battle,https://www.gofundme.com/we-need-help-with-our-cancer-battle,1,THECOLONY,TX,"I was diagnosed with stage 2 aggressive  breast cancer on February 14th 2018. Since that day my life has changed dramatically. I have been fighting for my life. The chemotherapy treatments ended with me being admitted to the hospital for severe dehydration  and gastritis. Then the surgery for removal of the tumor  and finally 30 rounds of radiation. Next I will be having follow-up scans  and continuing medications for 5 years. (that's if everything goes as planned) If there's one thing I have learned on this journey it's that you don't get to have a map. What I mean is that everyday can pose a twist or turn in the road that you had not planned or anticipated. That is why I'm starting this  Go-Fund_Me.Our financial situation because of this Cancer fight is overwhelming us to the point of desperation. We have been doing everything we can do to increase our income  and decrease our outgo. It's not been enough.Because of the generous gifts of friends and family through this Go-Fund-Me we have been able to meet a financial need of over $4 500.00.To say that we appreciate all that we have received is an understatement. Up until now Robert and I have been on the giving end of life. Now we find ourselves on the receiving end  and it's very humbling. God has been meeting our needs miraculously throughout this journey.This reminds me of a verse that explains my heart better than my words:\Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine  according to his power that is at work within us  TO HIM BE THE GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER!\""                                                                             Ephesians 3:20                                                           If you have already contributed to our cause then you are a  part of this miracle and part of our story. Thank you for reading this.

Kelso is currently unable to attend day care due to his chemotherapy treatments. As part of this treatment  it is imperative that Kelso attend clinic appointments and in the setting of illness needs to be in the presence of a caregiver who can bring him to the hospital immediately.Increased expenses apart from the overwhelming amount of hospital time  treatments  and numerous continued visits include gas money  eating at the hospital  lots of diapers. His mother needs to replace their washer because it broke ages ago but now has to change and wash Kelso's sheets daily so the laundromat just became a lot more expensive. Because she only found full time work in May of this year   she doesn't have savings and doesn't qualify for FMLA.Kelso is the youngest of three siblings  age 3. His older brother's are Calvin is 5 and Gus is 8. Their mother is Jeni Mallinen and his father is Mike Dodge. We know that GoFundMe is the third largest medical provider in the U.S.  and while it's not ideal  we know that this is what we can do as family  friends  and a society   to help this kiddo and his family.

Sauvez mon camion adapt&#xE9;,https://www.gofundme.com/handicapealunettesmobile,3,Trois-Rivieres-Ouest,QC,Bonjour  je me présente  Jean-Sébastien. Je me surnomme l'handicapé à lunettes. Je requière votre aide pour sauver ma liberté mobile. Mon camion adapté avait été saisi par la banque suite à une faillite du propriétaire légal. J'ai réussi à le racheter à la banque 11 000$. J'avais déjà payé 15 000$ au propriétaire pour le conserver chez moi  mais comme cet argent n'a pas servi à payer le camion  j'ai perdu cet argent. Mon camion adapté m'offre une liberté que je n'ai jamais eu auparavant. Il m'a grandement rendu service. J'ai pu l'utiliser pour aller faire réparer mon fauteuil roulant le jour même du bris ou aller d'urgence chez le vétérinaire pour soigner mon chien d'assistance. Le transport adapté est très inconfortable et peu pratique puisqu'il faut réserver 48 heures ouvrables à l'avance  prévoir ses heures de départ et retour. Il est aussi impossible de se déplacer en dehors dehors de la ville de Trois-Rivières sans faire appel à un transporteur privé à prix exorbitant.Mon divorce m'a laissé plusieurs dettes que je peine à payer. Si j'avais un imprévu comme un électroménager qui brise  il me serait impossible de le remplacer. Je prends donc un prêt pour payer la facture. Avec les taux d'intérêts à 10%  le remboursement s'élève à près de 16 000$. J'ai dû prévoir un montant d'emprunt supérieur pour pouvoir faire retirer un tumeur sur la tête de mon chien d'assistance.Voici le bilan de mes dépenses à rembourser:- prêt de 12 000$ pour acheter le camion- 2 006$ pour les taxes sur le camion- 450$ pour faire enlever la tumeur de mon chien- 1 500$ / 3 000$ pour le divorce- 15 000$ donné au propriétaire avant la faillite- dette de 3  800$ laissé par mon ex-femme J'ai grandement besoin de votre aide!

John Miller Medical Support Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/john-miller-medical-support,6,CAROLSTREAM,IL,The medical bills we faced for John this  year after his sudden leg amputation and heart and vision issues have been staggering  even with insurance  and the time has come to ask for help. There's still so much financially in regards to his care that is not covered by insurance and John has still not been approved for disability benefits. In January  our out-of-pocket insurance premiums will start all over again and I'm still paying bills for this year. I'm hoping to raise $2 000 which will cover our maximum out-of-pocket costs for all of 2019. Knowing I at least have the premiums paid for will be a huge burden lifted and I can concentrate on the other expenses John will need for his ongoing care. If by some miracle we raise more than $2 000 the rest will be put toward a motorized wheelchair for him  which will make it so much easier for him to get around when we want to be out for a longer period of time.I can't thank all of you enough for your tremendous outpouring of love and support for John this past year. It's meant the world to both of us!,1035,2000,15,52,24,114,7

Handicap Lift Equipped Vehicle,https://www.gofundme.com/handicap-lift-equipped-vehicle,7,PAYSON,AZ,Hello  we are Paul and Barbara Glinzak and we live in the High Country of beautiful Payson Arizona. We have lived in Payson for 20 years. I am a United States Air Force Veteran and served from 1975 to  1989. We have been married for 38 years. Barbara and I are both on disability. We are trying to raise funds that will help us obtain another vehicle that will need an electrical lift installed for my 4 wheel Scooter. I recently purchased a vehicle  made the down payment  and was told I could get a lift installed for my scooter. However  after owning this vehicle for four months now  I found out from the VA that my current vehicle has no capability to tow and now I need to get something that will accommodate the combined weight of the electrical lift (250 lbs.)  and scooter (180 lbs). Because I am handicapped and disabled  I am unable to walk normally without the aid of a walker or scooter. I can only walk about 20 feet as I suffer from chronic pain from my lower back and both hip joints. I got on disability in 2015 because I was no longer able to perform my job of 16 years due to major heart complications. Our hope is to meet any financial obligations that this will involve such as vehicle down payment  insurance  and tow package installation. We have no excess personal funds to do this with so we are humbly asking for help. Our goal is to raise $5000. I hope that my family  friends  and all others will consider helping me and my wife. Thank you.,285,5000,7,6,5,58,7
Helping Taylor after a fraud scam,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-taylor-after-a-fraud-scam,0,SHARPSBURG,GA,Recently i took a job as a personal assistant. It was a work from home job  which i believed to be perfect since i just had my daughter 2 months ago and i wanted to be able to stay home with her. This job required me to do tasks and make payments on behalf of my boss. I transferred money into my account and would withdraw it to pay for what he told me to. Well  it turns out the account i was transferring from was a stolen account  and all the money i took was not his. So basically like a bouncing a check  all the money got returned. But since i spent it when my “boss” told me to  i do not have any of it. So i owe the bank $39 000. obviously I do not have anything close to that and the bank is not able to help me what so ever. I hate asking for help like this  but we are so desperate. Please  any amount will help us so much. It’s going to be such a long road from here trying to fix this mess  but prayers are greatly appreciated. If anyone sees any “work from home personal assistant” jobs  please  be very cautious. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. Thanks for your help. -Taylor and Gabriella,1425,39000,7,4,21,254,7

Elena has been sick for the last year and a half since her family was PCS-ed to Colorado; a location with a high elevation and extremely dry climate. This was due to her Father being apart of the Military. Severe  persistent asthma has been a constant plague along with several atypical diseases that doctors have been unable to control. She  also  has extreme allergies due to environment they are living in which results in chronic hives and more difficulty breathing; despite the 9 medications she is on. She cannot go outside due to the severity of her asthma and allergies... And  she cannot go to school due to the chronic illnesses that continue to effect her. Though efforts have been made to assist  her Lungs refuse to adapt to the extreme climate change for which the move has placed her in.

However  her time is up.Elena now needs multiple procedures done in which she cannot have. She has developed GI issues and has been in/out of the hospital. She needs procedures done to further diagnose these new problems  but her lungs are not stable enough for her to go under anesthesia. She needs surgery on her teeth  due to the large amount of medication for her asthma causing significant damage. And  she is in constant pain. The doctors cannot clear her  though  due to high risk of respiratory distress it presents.Her Doctor are saying she is at risk of developing a life threatening condition called Tachyphylaxis: in which her rescue meds will simply cease working due to how much she has already had to use them.

She and their 4 children are coming back home to Florida so Elena can get medical care without fear of dying from a simple procedure because her lungs don’t function properly where they are. They'll only be leaving with what clothes they can fit in the car to get little Lanie over here.As they are not being assisted by the Military or anyone else  though  they will need finances to travel from where there down here.

Kevin Conwell Life Flight Transport,https://www.gofundme.com/kevin-conwell-life-flight-transport,9,BOZEMAN,MT,As many of you know  Kevin Conwell  Bozeman High School's Principal experienced a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in 2017  requiring a stem cell transplant at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. In his traditional spirit  Kevin focused on recovery and returned to campus earlier than doctors expected - resuming his duties with unwavering commitment and school spirit. If you have kids at Bozeman High School this fall semester  you have undoubtedly already seen Kevin in the halls and around the administration offices  back to work and back to his usual self. During the last week of September  Kevin was battling what appeared to be a common cold. It quickly progressed and moved to his spinal cord by the evening of Friday  September 28th. The virus caused inflammation  rendering him paralyzed with a condition called Transverse Myelitis. At this point in his treatment  Kevin needs respiratory support and has extremely restricted mobility.  While he has received excellent  stabilizing care at Bozeman Health Deaconess  Kevin’s best opportunity for recovery requires transfer to a larger  out-of-state medical facility with a specialty in spinal cord injury rehabilitation. The Life Flight transfer and the temporary relocation for the family outside of Bozeman involves many expenses that are not covered by insurance. We are asking you to wrap your arms around Kevin and the entire Conwell family as they are faced with this enormous  but necessary  financial burden to provide Kevin with the best care and the best foreseeable outcome.  While Kevin’s precise prognosis is uncertain at this time  we remain hopeful that he will eventually recover. Kevin's wife  Barb  three daughters - Laura  Jennifer  and Mary - and his grandchildren  Bridger and Emmie  are so grateful for the community's incredible support and are thankful for your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time. We will keep you updated as we move forward and would like to thank you for your continued prayers and support! Kevin has made a tremendous impact on the lives of our children and in the larger community. Let’s help Kevin get the best care possible to speed his road to recovery. Donations of any amount are much appreciated and will be used to provide Life Flight transportation and care during his out-of-state treatment. We will continue to provide updates on Kevin’s progress.,35840,40000,23,90,442,1000,7
Help Bill Fight his Brain Aneurysm!,https://www.gofundme.com/ThumbsUpForBill,9,JACKSONVILLE,FL,"On Wednesday  October 3rd 2018  my family received a horrifying phone call in regards to our dear uncle  brother  and friend William \Bill\"" Leavitt. We were told Bill had suffered a large brain aneurysm  and was being transferred via life-flight for emergency neurosurgery.  The aneurysm  which we now have learned runs in our family  had ruptured and caused a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage  which had subsequently lead to a massive stroke.Nevertheless  following his miraculous surgery  Bill survived and was transferred to the ICU - Condition: Critical  Coma. His Neurosurgeon proceeded to tell our family that \""his prognosis was very poor  and that approximately 80% of people in similar conditions have died instantaneously\"". The neurosurgeon then questioned us about any advanced directives or living wills  four hours after his operation. At that time  his neurosurgeon was very honest about his current condition and his likely clinical outcome - If Bill makes it through the next 24 hrs which are critical  his life will be tremendously different and he likely will live the rest of his life in a vegetative state.On Thursday October 4th 2018  only 24 hours later. Our Bill opened his eyes and squeezed our hands  letting us know that he was here with us.  We now have hope! Bill still cannot move  see  or speak. Sometimes  he can give us a \""thumbs up\"" with his right hand.He is still in very critical condition. However  he is now on the road to recovery and he has a chance at life again.As you probably know  medical bills are no joke. Brain surgery and ICU care is expensive. Bill's recovery in the hospital will last for weeks  and then most likely will have to be transported to a rehabilitation hospital so he can regain whatever motor control he can. Unfortunately  Bill does not have medical insurance at this time due to a career change (He had it at his old job  and hasn't been at his new job long enough for benefits)We ask of you for a small donation to help him financially. Any amount helps. Thank you.Thumbs up for Bill!!!""",3189,10000,8,32,44,439,7
Give Good Karma a PUSH,https://www.gofundme.com/give-good-karma-a-push,1,MIAMI,FL,As many of you may know  Darlaine de Troyban  is fighting the biggest battle of her life.  Her enemy  all too common unfortunately  is Cancer.  She has an inoperable biliary (liver duct) tumor  cholangiocarcinoma. After a grueling 7-hour surgery and over a month in the hospital with many post surgical complications  her remaining weapons are a remarkable medical team  chemo and radiation  and above all  faith and prayer.  She is currently undergoing chemo  with radiation to follow; a long  challenging road lies ahead of her. Aside from the tough side effects  secondary painful treatments for low blood cell counts   and the emotional roller coaster of not only her own fight with cancer  but also having her daughter  Jeanine  diagnosed simultaneously with cancer as well (thankfully  now cancer-free and recovering)  Darlaine is facing an insurmountable financial burden of medical costs  literally thousands a month currently not covered by her insurance. Due to the rarity of her cancer  there are no foundations or organizations in existence that are able to help subsidize treatment costs. She has many more months of treatment ahead of her.Darlaine is cringing at the moment because I have gone this route. Those who really know her  certainly can attest that she would never ask for anything for herself  no matter how much it is needed nor how much she is hurting.  I  however  her big mouth little sister  have no issues with this  since I feel all I am doing is giving Good Karma a PUSH in the right direction  so Darlaine can receive some of what she has given out freely  back. Darlaine is one of the most giving human beings I've ever known.  She was an amazing daughter to our parents  supporting them  including financially  through their old age when they were unable to; she is an incredible sister  always there for all of us as the new matriarch of our family; she is a caring and giving mother  wife  and grandmother  aunt  cousin  godmother.....you name it! She was an amazing boss  with so many of her old employees becoming life-long friends. She gave to her community through so many ministries and organizations  like Kairos Prison Ministry  being a catechist for young children  Cursillos  and helping ANYONE who asked in any way she could never asking for anything in return. Darlaine is one of my heroes  and an example of faith and fortitude.  Let's honor her with the help she needs.  We so very greatly appreciate any assistance you are able to provide.  GOD BLESS!,7900,50000,19,16,74,250,7
The Clark family flood relief fund,https://www.gofundme.com/236v4x-starting-over,2,MATTHEWS,NC,Hurricane Florence affected a lot of people in so many ways. My husband's sister's family had to leave the home that they were renting located on the Waccamaw River two days before  Hurricane Florence hit.  Ted  Jamie Jordan  Carlyn and Camden evacuated  with a  few items that they thought were of the most importance hoping for the best.  Unfortunately  their home was completely flooded. Not only that  because of the road leading to their home being flooded  it took 2 long weeks before they could check on their belongings. The house and contents are unsalvageable. So  they are not only facing relocation costs  replacing furniture etc.  but also all of the basic items we use everyday. Due to chronic health issues their financial situation is exacerbated.So if you are able to give  please consider this worthy cause.  I can't think of another family that deserves it more. Thank you for encouraging them in this new season of their life.,3715,5000,12,74,40,255,6

Fred Halik Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/fred-halik-fund,9,ROCHESTER,NY,Fred Halik  a man of selfless service; willing to drop everything he's doing to help others in need. There is an elderly woman who he mows the lawn for and picks up her groceries from the store. This man gives rides to complete strangers and provides them clothing so they can stay warm. When his son in Colorado lost his dog  he took the day off of work and made arrangements to go out there to help him find her. Fred has never asked of anything from anyone. He is 3 years from retiring and having his retirement to provide for him and his wife Cathy. Fred is an RTS bus driver of 10 years  providing a service to the community and his fellow peers.Fred was riding his bike to fix a vehicle that had broken down. During his ride  he was involved in a serious accident resulting in him being rushed to the Neurology section of the ICU at Strong Memorial Hospital and being treated for a traumatic brain injury. He currently has a fractured skull over the majority of its surface  and has damaged the language and comprehension portion of his brain.  His inter-cranial pressure has risen to the point of needing a catheter to drain the excess fluid and blood from his brain cavities.**Fred has made some progress. He is breathing on his own and has shown small signs of comprehension.The situation at hand is that Fred is the sole provider for his family.  Doctors do not believe that he will ever be able to drive again  which creates the financial problems of being able to pay the mortgage and medical  bills. Short-term disability will only pay $150/week and his family risks losing everything that they have worked so hard to achieve. His pay with sick time will only cover the next two weeks. The clock is ticking before the financial burdens will begin to diminish this family's dream of being able to retire. Please help this family continue being able to pay their bills and help a great man recuperate and continue helping people in his community. Any help will be greatly appreciated during this time of healing.Proceedings will go to Cathy Halik in efforts for her provide for herself and financial obligations. Thank you again for any support that can be made.,2735,50000,13,5,25,136,6
Benefit for Levi,https://www.gofundme.com/benefit-for-levi,6,FARMINGTON,ME,***UPDATE***10/10 - Levi's surgery yesterday was 9.5 hours and went exactly as the surgeon was hoping for with no surprises. The during surgery MRI scans show two tiny spots that we think are bleeding spots from tumor removal so he was confident he got either all or 99.9% of the tumor. Everyone's positive energy  prayers and vibes worked and Levi's life saving surgery went very well! Now we are in the recovery phase which is a crazy long journey with a lot of scary steps along the way. As you can imagine Levi has spent his first day post-surgery sleeping a lot and very confused. He also has pretty severe swelling. The drain remains in place while we wait to see if his body returns to drain fluid like normal or if he will need an additional surgery to install a shunt to redirect the fluid. We also are awaiting the final answer if the tumor was malignant or not. Keep the prayers coming for our brave little warrior!!10/8 - Thank you all so much for the donations  love  and support. Today we met with the neurosurgeon who is the head of the department and the one performing the surgery and acting as the lead on the team. Levi goes into the OR Tuesday at 6:30am and due to the size of the fluid filled cyst we don't know how long surgery will be  it could be 4 hours or 9 hours. The cyst is the fluid filled sac  the actual tumor is in two places and quite small although that doesn't mean it's simple. We won't go into the list of risks and complications as there were many. The goal of the surgery is to 1. Remove the fluid from the cyst 2. Remove the tumor and 3. Address any issues (that arise from the sudden drop in pressure in his brain  that has been there for months). Our surgeon said he would be shocked if the tumor sample came back cancerous but he can't rule it out (it takes a week for results). There are chances of further or future surgeries depending on what happens as well. Please keep Levi in your thoughts and prayers all Tuesday and this little boy has been so strong through this and needs our help to remain strong during the days and weeks ahead. 10/7 - The new MRI shows that the tumor is very large  which we knew. However  it is fluid filled  which is the easiest to remove! The only negative is that they will not know if the fluid in the tumor is cancerous until they get it out  so even though the previous fluid was negative for cancer  we're still not totally out of the woods yet. The removal is scheduled for Tuesday. 10/6 - Huge thank you to everybody for your love and support. Levi had his first emergency brain surgery last night to place an external drain to release some fluid and relieve some of the pressure. The drain is temporary and requires he stay calm and quiet (not easy for a 4yr old!) and it drains fluid safely. Next steps are MRIs that will help the team see the big tumor the best and create a plan for removal probably on Tuesday.  ***Levi Shaw is a bright and thoughtful 4 year old whose vibrant personality brings out the best in us (while usually making us laugh quite a bit). He is a wonderful big brother  and beloved son to Danielle and Adam Shaw. Levi was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital for swelling behind his eyes and around his nerves. After the CT scan came back as concerning  an MRI confirmed an 8 cm mass in his brain. Due to the seriousness of the mass  he was flown to Boston by helicopter for surgery and is in critical condition. We are asking for help for Danielle and Adam Shaw to meet their insurance deductible  and for help with Levi's continued medical care. Any donation amount helps  and is sincerely appreciated. Please keep Levi   Danielle  and Adam in your thoughts and prayers as they undergo this trying experience.,14235,25000,22,57,203,512,7

Andrew T. King Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/andrew-t-king-support-fund,7,HACKETTSTOWN,NJ,On Monday morning  October 1  instead of joining his colleagues in his new school to teach his third grade students  Andrew was admitted to the hospital with impaired vision and coordination.  His condition rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to the ICU and placed on a ventilator where he will remain until his respiratory system grows stronger.  Doctors determined he has been stricken with Miller-Fisher syndrome  a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Although the prognosis for his recovery is positive  it is not uncommon for recovery from this syndrome to take six to twelve months. Andrew had a violent reaction to the initial immunoglobulin treatment. He is currently undergoing Plasmapheresis treatments administered by the Red Cross in which his own blood is being replaced by new  donated plasma.  There will be a series of 5 treatments over a 10 day period.  Andrew is devoted to his girlfriend Cassie  his family and friends. He has a passion for teaching  and has never shied away from helping others in need.  He was excited to begin teaching at his new school and loved his co-workers and class.  Your donation will help offset the medical costs associated with the lengthy hospital stay  the Plasmapheresis treatments and other supportive therapy Andrew requires to regain his health and to restore him to his family  his friends and his life.Thank you for your generosity  prayers and support!,5500,50000,14,11,89,451,6
Chad Piddock Recovery Fund!,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpChadPiddock,5,AUSTIN,TX,Alright everyone  it’s been a roller coaster with my homie/roommate Chad Piddock. He was involved in a Motorcycle accident two nights ago on 10-3-18... he is suffering from brain trauma and also unfortunately he had to get his left leg from the knee down amputated. He literally needs everyone’s prayer. He is being more responsive today trying to move his body but still in a slight coma. Please just pray for his family and his recovery.The reality of the situation is tough so his brother James Piddock and I along with our close friends and family will be starting this gofundme just to help with the everyday struggles that will be coming pretty fast. This fundraiser will just try to help with some of the quick stuff in life that still sticks around even if you are in a hospital. This will just help pay for his bills/ food/ transportation for his family everyday to the hospital as well. And whatever quick rehab we can get him in once he wakes up.  I’m sure after this fundraiser  his mother and family will start another fundraiser for all of his medical expenses that the insurance won’t cover after we get more of the facts. .,6130,5000,16,123,54,224,7
Help Larry Kick Cancer&#x2019;s Butt!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-larry-beat-cancers-a,0,PITTSBURGH,PA,My father  Lawrence L. Warner III  one of the best humans I know.....he was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer with Mets in August 2018. Today  October 5th  2018 marked the beginning of his journey in fighting this horrific disease as he had surgery to remove the primary of the cancer. It has been advised that he rest  and no heavy lifting for 4-6 weeks. Moving on to the next steps in this fight  October 11th for port placement and the 12th for a full panel of testing to determine addtional areas of concern (if any.)On October 19th we will have a treatment plan in place and will be given the green light on the chemo start date. He will need to receive chemo every 3 weeks for 4-5 treatments. This will be very taxing on my father and his ability to make a living. He is an independent worker and if he does not work  he does not get paid. My mother is a sole supporter with a new job that she is thankful for  but won’t be enough to stay afloat. I have gotten a 2nd job in hopes that I will be able to help offset when needed  but looking at this with fresh eyes......much more is needed. My only wish is for my Dad to have the time he needs to relax and not rush back to work.He WILL go to work if the bills aren’t getting paid. For anyone that knows him  knows this to be true. Realistically  his ability to work will be limited...and the stress of that financial barrier will be all to much for him to bare. My father would give the shirt of his back for anyone. Maybe he has to some of you. If you could help in any way  no amount is ever too small.My family would be forever grateful for your kindness. It took a lot for me to type this up because typically us “Warner’s” like to handle our business. Not today....today we ask for just a Little Love for Larry. My only concern is my Dad being able to get his treatment  get healthy  and be restored to good health.Thank you so much in advance. Love  Kim  Deb  Lisa and Shelly,4160,10000,8,42,88,1000,7

Please Help The Kernan Family,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-the-kernan-family,0,BALDWIN,MD,"Please help the Kernan Family with  funds to keep their home!!! Due to the devastating car accident that occurred involving Phil and Korey  the family has suffered not only physically but financially as well. They desperately need funds to save their home. They also need funds for everyday costs while they are both recuperating. Please help this loving family get back on their feet   to be able to stay in their home  and to heal!Funds will go directly to Krystal Kernan who is handling the families responsibilities at this time.Words from Krystal:\They say it comes in Threes\"".....Boy  have we been misinterpreting this old adage! For our family  it certainly has been the number three...but three full YEARS of tribulations.  Our hearts are still here  but they are heavy  they are tired  and for the only time I can ever remember  they are asking for help instead of giving it. For those of you who know our family  you know already that our symbolism of \""Threes\"" began in August 2015  when our Kernan world  ceased to exist they way we had  forever known it....Momma stepped into her light.  As a whole  we are the furthest from self- involved  so we certainly know we were not the first souls  nor could ever be the last  who's Wife  Mother and Gigi transcended far too soon. Nevertheless  this rocked our world...and not the way The Rolling Stones intended it.  We grieved  we carried each other  and we LOVED. Momma's way...Love  Love  Love.Then January of 2016 rolled around. On the 20th of this month (the day before Mom's first birthday in the Heavens)  Dad's house...the home he built with Mom (and that he built with his own two hands  I might add)  the home that all three of us Kernan kids (and ALL of our friends) had the most awesome childhood growing up in....burnt down. A fluke fire began in the chimney   spreading through the basement  living room and continued through the upstairs. By the Grace of whatever Higher Power you believe in...EVERYONE was safe!Fast forward to two (Yes  TWO) years later  and Dad's home was rebuilt. (Worst. Contracting. Company. EVER...but that's another story). In this time  not only was Dad  Korey and Kaylee displaced for so very long  we also lost Mom's Mom...aka Gram...and Mom's brother  George...who  for the last year of his life  was cared for solely by Dad. Much more over the last three years  but that's just the most jarring of accounts.  Then we come to August 2018.....end of the Summer; Kane's birthday; as typical a morning as could be....until THAT moment. That moment that shook us all again  not knowing what would become.Dad and Korey were involved in an accident with an 18 wheeler. Physically  Dad sustained broken ribs and a fractured knee. When he came to  he realized that his child  (although an adult...still his child)   was not in the passenger seat. We still do not know how Dad got out of the vehicle...(MIRACLES)... but somehow he did  and he searched and found his kid. Korey's door was buckled from the impact  ejecting him from the truck. This landed him under the 18 wheeler  which then drug him about 100 feet further. His arm was pinned under the massive truck's wheel.  I cannot tell you what thoughts were in my Father's mind (mostly because I cannot let myself even imagine those thoughts as a parent  let alone as a  sister) but I know those thoughts  those images... haunt him every time he blinks... Korey and Dad were flown to Shock Trauma. Dad's injuries allowed for him to remain awake and coherent  and we were able to take him home the next morning  to care for him. It was not easy to get him to leave his son in Shock Trauma (this is the most understated sentence EVER  by the way.) Korey's injuries were a different story. He was in a coma for 4 and 1/2 days. I was bedside with him  and although those days blurred together  every moment plays back like a slo-mo movie reel  to no avail sometimes. Dad physically could not be there with Korey every minute  because broken ribs and a fractured knee keep you pretty immobile...but that Kernan stubbornness though  he was hell on wheels when the crutches could come into play!Let's jump to Korey waking up (because those 4 days can not be rendered into words from my perspective).  Korey had multiple lacerations  stabs  gauges  glass  road and debris embedded from head to toe  and 3 blood transfusions. His right arm  was mangled beyond belief...like a shark attack (only thing I have ever laid eyes on to even come closed to the imagery). When he finally woke  he had just had his 3rd reconstruction surgery on his arm. They removed muscle from the length of his back to rebuild the meat of the arm  and graphed his legs to regrow skin on almost the entire surface.  2 more surgeries followed the massive reconstruction. So far  they  have been successful. No function yet  but blood is flowing and there is regrowth! Several surgeries are scheduled for the near and far future.Luck isn't even a word to use here.....Miracle...nothing but a Miracle.  2 more weeks were spent in Shock Trauma  and then he was able to be brought home. We all finally breathed again that day. (My Father though...he has yet to exhale.) Kane became their 24/7 nurse/crutch  shoulder...you name it  and Kane was that for Dad and Korey both. (And he still is  every day). WARNING: Images are gnarly....So here we are  almost 3 months later...physical healing  is going as well as we can pray for. Some days are tougher then others  but at the end of each day  the reality that they are both still here to walk the earth  makes the bare of it all much lighter to carry.  Now emotional healing...unfortunately  I can not say the same. The damage to his arm has left Korey disabled by all accounts. He is a carpenter by trade  and right handed.  As anyone who has ever filed for disability knows  they automatically deny you...several times...before even considering.  With Dad having been retired for several years now  and Korey unable to work  there is NO money. Besides the intensity of the accident and following weeks themselves  Korey being unable to help provide for Dad  himself  and his beautifully sassy 11 year old  Kaylee...has taken it's toll on Korey  on a level inconceivable for anyone who has ever known him and his personality.  And Dad.....Dad  forever our ROCK..... is in a place that crumbles me from the outside looking in. I'm sorry   but I can't even put this part of the story into words for you. So  here we are....Please help my Father keep his home. Please help the Kernans HEAL...on all levels. We WILL pay it forward.  We WILL share the love.  We ARE forever grateful. LOVE TO YOU ALL-Krystal--------------------------------------------""",6809,40000,15,17,63,301,5
On a Journey with Grace,https://www.gofundme.com/on-a-journey-with-grace,0,LIBERTYHILL,TX,My name is Grace McKinney and the story I want to share is not about WHO I am because that seems reconciled but rather it is the telling of an unexpected life journey that I have managed to travel these past four years. I was diagnosed with amblyopia and strabismus at age four which was the introduction to what would come to be the “focus” of a lot of my struggles.Who I am is an 18-year-old creative soul who anchors in a deep faith that helps keep me on track as my physical body wreaks havoc on me. I did not choose this journey  but it has chosen me and stolen from me the “typical” life I thought teenage years would bring. While others worried about their clothes  going out with friends  the colleges they would choose  I fought to make it through every day with pain and headaches unimaginable. Even though the pain and anxiety pulled me one direction  I pushed through to hold on to any scrap of normalcy I could squeeze out of high school. I did this not only for myself but to make it easier on those around me who would never understand the hell I was living inside my body and behind closed doors.Amblyopia  Strabismus  Significant Scoliosis with a double curve  Dry Eye Disease  Meibomian Gland Disorder  Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome  anxiety  chronic pain  headaches  cornea neuropathy  and auto-immune diseases that still have no answer are all vying for a dominant place in my life and daily existence. And YET – no one sees any of this!I came to realize in high school that I was living with Invisible Illnesses and had joined the ranks of so many who “look fine” but are raging a battle with the fight for health and normalcy with little to no support of those around us. In wanting to be “normal” and fighting so hard  I did not only myself a disservice but those around me. I wrote my Senior Thesis on the reality of Invisible Illness just so I could take the first steps to turn my tapestry around and let people see the ugly side – where all the knots and strings hang from the beautiful picture they created on the other side.My parents are my biggest champions and they have gained their own medical degrees (not really but they should have) in the amount of research and time vested in trying to connect me with doctors and interventions that might be able to help solve the underlying issues. We have learned that many physicians only want to answer the obvious and so I was dismissed by many due to my age and their lack of knowledge or willingness to recognize that SOMETHING was wrong. My parents did not give up and we have travelled near and far to seek out help. Passion has driven this  but it came at a cost as the doctors who know the most often did not take insurance. A lot of sacrifice of which I am truly grateful.The fight still goes on as I was most recently tested for Lyme disease. After so many years of being treated for inflammation  although there have been some improvements in hormone levels and vitamins  there is still obviously something that is being missed because the pain is still there and sometimes just as bad as when all this began. I travel to Nashville for PRP drops for my eyes and see a specialist in Austin for overall management but there are more tests and treatment that I need which brings me to launching this out for those that might be able to support me on this journey to health.Please know I continue to fight and take opportunity to bring Invisible Illness to a place of Visibility so that others do not suffer in silence. I am taking a gap year and not starting college because I need to focus on my health and pray I can get to a place that I might be able to attend college. In the interim  I am working on my own creative brand and passion as well as working one day a week(which is all I can really physically handle) just to keep me engaged. I blog to tell my story and to inspire people with the joy of creativity (and dogs).Asking for financial support is something I never imagined I would do but I also never imagined that I would be in this place fighting for my life and a cause that is now so close to my heart. Please know if all you do is read this then I have opened up the conversation with one more person about Invisible Illness and now you no longer can ignore the reality that someone right in front of you may be hurting or suffering from a disease you cannot see. Disabilities do not all come in wheelchairs or in blatant forms so as to make you stop and render aide so pause and show compassion in the chance that someone needs it.I realize many of you want to know what is ahead and how does the money get used. Here is what we know:Counseling (weekly to address all that come with living with Invisible Illnesses) - $400 monthly (no insurance taken)Local Specialist (who is managing and helping to unravel all the pieces) - $1200 yearly -I see him about 3 times a year (no insurance taken)PRP drops (done in Nashville by eye doctor who specializes in this for cornea nerve regeneration) -$500 per collection (insurance does not cover) done about 2-3 times a year and involves travel.Supplements and Medication - $300 monthUpcoming Infusions - $1200 (Looking to have about 3 different infusions to address different issues in hopes of pain relief)Visit to reknown Cornea Specialist in Boston - wanting to go see a doctor at the New England Eye Center who is published on the issue of cornea neuropathy and the pain associated with it and is engaged in ongoing treatment modalities to address the severity and reality of this condition. We are waiting to go until after my infusions as this will involve cost for travel and accommodations while seeing the doctor over several days. - approximately $4000Again  I know that many people are in my same boat and many struggle financially so the goal here is more than dollars but rather the opening of a conversation. I am looking for others to come along side me on this journey through prayer  support  inquiry  passion  creativity and hope.Thank you in advance for reading and caring. May the blessings of that genuineness come back to cover each of you.,4040,20000,10,20,13,108,7
Aaron White&apos;s medical assistance,https://www.gofundme.com/aaron-white039s-medical-assistance,6,PRESCOTT,AZ,My name is Barb White  and I'm organizing this account to help fund needed medical assistance for my grandson Aaron White.  Aaron is 8  and has three brothers--Mason his twin   Logan   and Daniel.   Aaron has been complaining of pain in his hips and knees so his parents took him into a local orthopedic doctor for further examination and given an x ray  which revealed a chip in his kneecap from an earlier fall on the pavement; and his left femoral bone to be growing different than his right femur which explains why he is pigeon toed.  An MRI was then ordered and the results showed a fracture in the left femur bone above the growth plate with an image (either a bad infection or a tumor). No wonder he had been complaining of pain!  The doctor here then referred them to a sub specialist at Phoenix Children's Hospital for further consultation and tests.   The parents have been told that what Aaron is facing wil be very expensive  not only with determining what kind of a tumor this is   and possible surgery to remove it   but also down the road to address the realignment of his left hip and the need for physical therapy afterwards.  They have some insurance   but any assistance you could give this family would be appreciated to help cover any upcoming copays  tests   physical therapy and trips back and forth to Phoenix.  I'm a firm believer in prayer and that God is good!  If you're unable to give financially    please lift them up in prayer.   Thank you so much for your support!,8839,26000,9,34,105,1000,7
Help Heal Sanctions: Mohamad&apos;s Tale,https://www.gofundme.com/save-mohammad039s-life,7,BROOKLYN,NY,Help Heal Sanctions: Mohamad’s Tale How often does news of US foreign policy and its causalities leave you feeling powerless? Who wants to scroll their news feed and feel numb or depressed before a day of work  knowing there is absolutely nothing you can do to help? Great way to start a GoFundMe  right? Look  I’m not going to pretend like we’re going to save the world through this stuff.  I know I can’t. But what I know is I can start where I’m at.  Sometimes that’s enough to make a difference. If even for one person. Meet Mohamad. If he could last two more years  doctors say the medication he needs to cure his illness will be available to reverse the devastation wrought. Let’s rewind. Until age 14  Mohamad did two things in life: Play soccer with his friends  and run to school [to stay fit for soccer]  where he was studying hard to become top student in his class. Suddenly  tragedy struck 4 years ago  when Mohamad was diagnosed with a fatal disease: Lafora.  That’s when he stopped playing soccer. And  also  when he stopped running to school. Over the last 4 years  the once agile and witty Mohamad has suffered a slow progression of increasingly severe and frequent seizures  rendering him barely cognitively and physically functional. To delay this deadly progression  Mohamad is taking a number of medications  the most crucial of which  Fycompa  is only available to him for thousands of dollars  every round [12 more times over the next two years]  due to sanctions which have made it both difficult to get to Iran and extremely expensive due to the ever-weakening currency.  With our help  Mohamad will last two more years to get a new disease-curing medication—Can you help him make it to that time [We are raising to cover the next 12 treatments spread out in 2-month cycles for the next 2 years]? His middle-class family has now gone into debt funding the meds to keep him alive. Your support is invaluable. Thank you. Please pass this on.,290,10000,15,3,10,46,5

Bugs Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/8fm3z5-bugs-medical-bills,6,ERIE,PA,This is Bug. She was bitten in the face by a dog a few months ago. As she healed she became blind in her left eye and her tongue sticks out slightly because her jaw doesn’t line up properly. However  as She continues to grow she will need to have surgery done. She can’t open her mouth very wide so soft food is all she can eat. She may need to have her jaw realigned and her eye will need extensive care or possibly removed.

Chelsea Raquel Pharr,https://www.gofundme.com/chelsea-raquel-pharr,1,CLOVIS,CA,Update:  There have been close to 500 shares and over 2 000 views.  Thank you for your thoughtfulness.  However   with all that sharing and viewing  there have only been 14 donations to date.  Please know that even $10.00 or $20.00 when given by many adds up.  Chelsea's co-pays are $55.00 - and with 5 months of chemo  followed with I don't know how many rounds of radiation and finally surgery.....all those co pays will add up as well as the cost of the surgery.  Not to mention no paychecks while she is in the infusion room  radiation room  and off during surgery. So please  consider donating something  anything at all to keep this young person from falling into deep debt while she is fighting for her life!To know Chelsea is to love her.  She has a heart full of kindness  love  and service for others. For those that don't know her - she is so young - only 26 - with her entire life ahead of her.   When we heard the news that she has stage 2  triple negative breast cancer we were devastated.  However  nobody was as devastated as our sweet Chelsea and her immediate family:  Julie Maxwell  her mother (my niece)  Carole  her grandmother (my sister)   her brother Brandon and her sister Destiny. Cancer and chemo are scary words for anyone - let alone someone in the prime of their life.  She has an aggressive cancer  so she will endure aggressive treatment with chemotherapy  radiation and surgery.  She will lose all of her beautiful hair and miss a lot of work on unpaid leave. Chelsea lives alone and is self-supportive.  She has always worked in positions where her job was to serve others with intellectual or developmental disabilities.  Which speaks to the type of heart she has.   It would be wonderful help support her financially during these trying times and give back to her.  The money will be used to buy a wig and to help pay for her medical treatment and living expenses.  Like most young people starting out  she does not have sick or vacation pay or savings account to carry her through the next year.  Although we all have life crisis to live through   Chelsea has had more than her fair share. Most recently  she was the rock for her mother Julie when her stepdad killed himself.  Chelsea loves the Lord  so please remember Chelsea when you pray each day.  Thank you  everyone  for your donations and for bringing encouragement and hope to my sweet niece.,1217,5000,3,24,17,544,7

Medical Fund for Daniel Varela,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-fund-for-daniel-varela,0,ESTESPARK,CO,A brief life history about Daniel Varela AvitiaDaniel was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). He is legally blind but not completely  he can still see some shapes  shadows  and figures. Daniel and his parents first moved to Estes Park when he was just 5 years old they had left Chihuahua Mexico to give Daniel a better life and to seek healthcare for Daniel’s eyesight. He went to school here in Estes Park to unable to speak or understand English. Spanish was his primary language along with his parents. His parents had always worked very hard. Daniel had challenges and obstacles growing up but nothing has ever stopped him even after being stuck in the river and had to be rescued or had an accident while driving an ATV. Throughout his school years he was scared at first because of language barriers and slowly he learned to speak English and that has helped him. He had gone to Eagle Rock  School for the deaf and blind in Colorado Springs  and then graduated high school early from Loveland High. At the same time Daniel has worked in restaurants as a host  dishwasher  and prep. Shortly after High School  Daniel had the help from Lyons Club and Gail Frey of Longmont to help him get his seeing eye dog Wrigley. They became best friends immediately and after a month of training Wrigley has come home with Daniel. After high school Daniel has decided that he wanted a career but not another 2-4 years of school  so he looked into fast track classes and found his calling as a Massage Therapist at Healing Arts in Fort Collins. He grew up as an only child and in 2011 he has gain a little Sister Danaly. After he had earned his Certification of Massage Therapist he looked for jobs and no luck  so he again didn’t give up and decided to write up a business plan and put it into motion and open his own Massage Business in 2013 at the Old Churchshop downtown Estes Park. Later in 2013 he had found his soulmate Maria Yazzie and shortly after they got together. Maria has permanently moved from Az to Estes Park CO in October 2013. Maria and Daniel and Wrigley along with his parents and sister have gone through so many challenges and obstacles and they have never given up. On May 2017 Daniel was home alone with Wrigley while everyone was working  he had a medical scare that he thought he was a having a stroke. Then he was taken to EPH and from there sent him to MCR to see what was happening. All his testing had come back negative and the Drs couldn’t explain what he has suffered. Daniel had completely lost movement on his left side of the body. Speech  hearing  eyesight (what was left of it)  strength and wasn’t able to walk. But he still didn’t give up at all. Going to get off track for a while: later that year in 2017 Daniel and Maria decided to get married but had to put it on hold due to Daniel medical scare. They had decided to have a wedding this year in Oct. but again they have once again are going to put it off for a while longer. After being released from MCR Daniel continued to be weak  but he had slowly regained strength back with the help of his fiancée Maria and parents. In November 2017  Daniel began to feel sick and again after numerous Dr and ER visits he was told that he was fine. In January 2018 he couldn’t hear out of his left ear and had made an appointment with Dr Luchsinger of EPH and she notice that his left ear was completely covered with blisters and sent him to MCR to get treated and was diagnosed with Ramsey Hunt Disease (shingles). So the shingles was developing on the inside of his ear and affecting his left side of his body. It was attacking his nerves from the inside. To make the long story short Daniel worked closely with Dr Luchsinger and number of other speciality Drs from Infectious Disease  Rheumatologist Neurologists Ophthalmologist  ENT and etc. During this difficult time Maria Daniel’s fiancée had to get a second job just to try to keep up with some of the bills (personal and medical). But Daniel still does work at his Massage office but not liKe he use to before his illness. He’ll do a couple massages here and there just to help stay a float. Since Daniel was unable to help provide for the both of them. Daniel’s immune system is unable to fight off any infections  virus  or bacteria. So Dr Luchsinger has decided to send Daniel to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to see if they can figure out what is causing all of Daniel’s medical condition to get worse. At this time they are just waiting to get the call to get the appointment setup. But as they did their research it could takes weeks or months before Daniel can be seen at Mayo. That is where Maria (Daniel’s Fiancée) is asking for help with any kind of donations. They would like to get something started and saved for when they have to travel to Minnesota. Anything helps  they have to travel to Minnesota for who knows how long. Maria will have to take time off from both jobs. Any donations will be used towards the travel  and medical bills or deposit that is needed once they get to Mayo. If there is any donations left it will be used towards Daniel’s future medical treatment and Dr visits. Daniel  Maria  his parents and little sister would thank you in advance for any contributions they received.,2765,25000,8,11,30,323,7
Help My Sister,https://www.gofundme.com/bhyvy-help-my-sister,0,BALTIMORE,MD,Hello My name is Leron Baucum and I’ve started this campaign on behalf of my sister  Angela Bannerman. She recently became homeless and yesterday  her car was repossessed while at work. This left her stranded in DE and unable to get back here to MD  where she is temporarily staying with me.Let me explain how things got to this point. During the last four years of our mother’s life  my sister took time away from her job as a teacher’s assistant to be Mom's full-time caregiver. Having worked in healthcare her entire 25-year career  Mom was adamant about avoiding nursing home care. Even though it meant having little or no income  my sister did what she could to keep Mom from going into a nursing facility if possible.After Mom passed  we found out she had to take out a reverse mortgage on the home at some point. This meant my sister would have to pay off this mortgage  or get refinanced  to keep the home. Her salary as full-time teacher’s assistant was not enough to afford the monthly mortgage required to stay in the home. So  in June of this year  she was evicted from her home – the only home she's lived in her entire life. With no immediate place to go  she became homeless. Eventually  I found out how bad things were going for her  including having slept in her car a few nights  and insisted she come stay with me. Unfortunately  this is only temporary as my lease does not allow another tenant long-term.Yesterday  the hole she's in got deeper & wider when her car was repossessed. Not only was she stranded in DE  it also meant she wouldn't be able to work her second job as an Uber driver. Yes  my sister works two jobs but still does not make a living wage.Our mother didn’t raise us to ask others for help  which is a large part of why Angela didn’t reach out to anyone (including me) until these final blows of homelessness and repossession. I wish I could provide the assistance she needs but cannot. I am on Social Security Disability and can only provide a roof over her head  no substantial financial help. This is why I have set up this page asking anyone  everyone  whomever reads this to help get her back on her feet.The goal has been set for $4 500. This amount will get her car back ($2 125) and help cover a few months for the storage unit (where her household items  most of her clothes  and her prized piano are). It will also provide enough for at least a security deposit and first-month's rent so she’ll have a place to call home again.I am sure there are many stories like Angela's.  I  and she  would be appreciative and grateful of any and all donations that are given.Forever Grateful Leron Baucum,1325,4500,20,29,12,35,7

Ashley&apos;s Fund 2 Fight Cancer #3,https://www.gofundme.com/ashleysfund2fightcancerx3,1,ERIE,PA,We want to start by thanking everyone who contributed to our last GoFundMe campaign for Ashley.  Ashley was sincerely touched by every single person's donation and could never thank everyone enough for the support they showed her.  Everyone's generosity allowed her to focus on her health without worrying about finances. In addition to dealing with the physical and emotional challenges related to her ongoing battle with cancer  we were also faced with putting to sleep our 17-year-old family dog  Dylan  in June.  Then again in September  her 1-year-old cat  Leo  got sick and passed away.  2018 has been a rough year and we'd like to lift any financial worries from her shoulders. Ashley's battle from the beginning: In June 2017  Ashley was diagnosed with cancer on her vocal cords. She had 29 treatments of radiation  concluding in August. The cancer returned 6 months later in February and her surgeon told her she would need a total laryngectomy (removal of the voicebox and separating the airway from the throat).  This news was pretty devastating since it is a life-changing surgery.  After seeking 3 additional opinions at other top hospitals  she chose to have a partial laryngectomy (removal of part of the voicebox) in Cleveland. Ashley had surgery on March 29th and spent 10 days in the hospital.  The surgical pathology report showed that instead of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) she was originally diagnosed with  she actually had high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC)  which explained why radiation alone didn't eliminate the cancer completely.  MEC is very rare  particularly in the voicebox.  She had a temporary tracheostomy (tube in the neck to breathe)  which was removed about 1 month later.  In May  she had some complications that sent her to the ER twice  back into the OR  leading to 10 more days in the hospital.  After months of tube feeding and practicing swallowing exercises to learn to protect her airway when swallowing  finally by the end of June Ashley was able to start eating by mouth  and on July 2nd her feeding tube was removed.  Things were looking up! At Ashley's 4 month post-op follow-up appointment on August 6th  a growth was seen in her throat that called for a biopsy.   It was confirmed that the cancer was back and this time she would need a total laryngectomy.  The total laryngectomy separates the airway from the esophagus  so you no longer breathe through your nose and mouth  but through a permanent hole in your neck called a stoma.  Ashley had this surgery on September 10th and spent a week in the hospital.  During the surgery  she had a TEP (tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis) placed.  A TEP is a small one-way valve placed connecting the esophagus to the trachea that allows air into the esophagus and up through the mouth so Ashley can talk  but stays closed when she eats so food and liquids don't pass through into the trachea.  She also needed a free flap reconstruction procedure  in which the surgeon took tissue and a blood vessel from her forearm to rebuild her esophagus.  A skin graft was taken from her thigh to cover the wound on her forearm.  Since Ashley had radiation last year  the reconstructive surgeon is waiting until October 12th to let her attempt the swallow test (to make sure there are no leaks) and to try talking.  We're hoping both of these go smoothly. After discussing the surgical pathology results  Ashley's doctors are now recommending that she receive chemo and radiation treatments.  Her cancer was super aggressive and invasive  and even though chemo and radiation aren't completely proven to work for MEC  they want to fight it as best as they can to prevent it from coming back.  Chemo and radiation have a better chance at fighting stray microscopic cancer cells that may have lingered after surgery than at eliminating visible tumors.  Ashley will start 6 weeks of chemo and radiation in Cleveland on October 22nd. Ashley used up her sick days last year to recover from radiation and for doctor's appointments leading up to her surgery in March  leaving her no paid time off to take April-June.  While she earned more sick days this school year  she has already used them up and will be going unpaid into the beginning of January.  Hopefully Ashley will be able to stay at the Hope Lodge in Cleveland during her treatments  which is provided for free by the American Cancer Society.  She's currently on the waiting list.  Please don't feel obligated to donate  but even small donations are helpful and appreciated :-)  If you'd like to donate outside of this website  please send me (Kristen) an email by clicking on my name on the right side of this page.  Thank you all so much.  Let's help Ashley kick this cancer for good- third time's the charm!,3385,6000,24,56,51,113,7

Her PET scan and MRI alone cost them well over $12 000  which her mom had to put on a credit card.  Unfortunately  this is just the beginning.Sonja is in the process of trying to get health insurance  but so many of these procedures will not be covered  including the attempt to preserve her fertility by retrieving her eggs before having to have a full hysterectomy.  This is someone who has dreamed her whole life of having children  and deserves a chance to do so with the love of her life.  Her journey will not stop there - she will also have to go through chemo and radiation  and obviously will not be able to work during this process.  I started this in hopes of relieving some of the financial burden Sonja and her family are facing on top of this heartbreaking diagnosis.  Please help in any way you can - whether it's a donation  by sharing this page  or a much needed prayer. ❤️,7950,35000,12,23,121,767,7
Oscar&apos;s Kidney Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/oscar039s-kidney-transplant,3,UNIONCITY,NJ,Hi everyone! My name is Ana Salgado Dennery. My dad has kidney failure and has been on dialysis for a year and a half now. My sister  karen  has been undergoing testing over the past year to see if she could donate a kidney to him. Luckily  we found out just a few days ago that she is a match  and they will both be having transplant surgery on nov 14th. My dads health insurance covers most of the cost for the procedures  but there is an out of pocket cost for some of the anti rejection medication that he needs to take immediately after surgery. These medicines are very expensive but without them  he can lose the new kidney. My sister works full time as an ICU nurse  has 2 kids  and is the main bread winner of the househole  including both my parents. She will be out of work for at least 6 weeks and unfortunately the temporary disability benefits will not cover all expenses. Between my mother  brother  sister  and myself  we will do as much as we can  but we are asking for your help. Anything you can donate will be greatly appreciated❤ ¡Hola a todos! Mi nombre es Ana Salgado Dennery y yo creé esto para ayudar a mi padre con los costos médicos en los que incurrirá debido a su trasplante de riñón. Ha estado en diálisis durante un año y medio. Después de muchos examenes  mi hermana Karen descubrió la semana pasada que es compatible y que va a donar uno de sus riñones. La cirugía será el 14 de noviembre de este año. Aunque tiene seguro de salud  no cubre todos los medicamentos contra el rechazo que deberá tomar durante un mínimo de 3 meses después de la cirugía. Cualquier donación ayuda ya que mi madre sola no puede pagar todos los medicamentos. Tambien ayuda a mi hermana a pagar los bills ya que ella tiene que dejar de trabajar por dos meses. Por supuesto que yo  al igual que mis otros hermanos  ayudaremos  pero no podemos hacer mucho. Gracias a todos y que Dios los bendiga!,2670,7000,15,38,42,203,7

We first met Tini on a service learning trip in Fiji.   One night we were playing \Duck Duck Goose\""  we all noticed that he was really limping  so we talked to his dad and asked him what happened.

The next day we discussed putting together a project to help this boy.  This will benefit this Tini for the rest of his life.  He will also be able to have a childhood full of laughter and running without pain.   The village that he lives in is on a remote island.   It is difficult to access medical services  especially a complicated procedure like he needs.  The Children's Hospital in Los Angeles has a program that we can work with.  We just need to figure out a way to help the family with the transportation costs.  We would be grateful for your donation to help Tini and his family.""",3200,7500,40,43,19,9,5

Pastor with No Insurance- Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/pastor-with-no-insurance-surgery,8,MANSFIELD,TX,"Uncle Phil is not my uncle  technically  but he could be anybody's uncle. I was heartbroken when I received a phone call that nobody ever wants to hear  informing me that this stalwart of a man-- a longtime pastor  a loving husband and outstanding father--was in the ICU. Confused  weak  with no appetite  dehydrated  with sores on his legs and feet.He's been wrestling with diabetes for years  but the situation has become more complicated.The doctors quickly surmised a major issue; blocked arteries to the brain. Yes  arteries  plural. One is only fifty percent (insofar as I can say only  when talking about blocked arteries to the brain) while the other is a full hundred-percent obstructed by plaque. In the long-term  this puts him at drastically higher risk for a stroke  but obviously it's taking its toll already. And the toll is more than physical.Phil is a pastor  traditionally cared for by the congregation he shepherds  but with no insurance to cover him  his costs will be very high indeed. The surgery that would be required to fix his clots typically costs anywhere from $8-12k  and the particular version of the surgery being considered rests on the higher end of that range. Throw in an anagram for the unknown bacterial infection on his legs  plus treatment  and we're probably looking at costs upward of $20 000. That's not all. Phil's amazing wife  my 'Aunt' Dian  is a full-time mother of two teenage boys (as a brother of two boys  I can testify that this is a full-time job  and then some). She has not been properly on the workforce for years  and will have a very difficult time supporting her husband and kids while Phil is unable to perform his duties at the church. Our hope and prayer is that God will provide for the healing of Phil and the sustenance of his family. I say \our\"" hope and prayer  because Phil is not alone. He is surrounded by his family  and he is also being tended to by those in his congregation. But we need your help.I'm not exactly strapped with cash  but I'm giving what little I have to help-- and it won't be a lot. Maybe a few cups of coffee a week. But it doesn't have to be a lot  because I won't be alone.If you want to know more  or want to send some letters of encouragement  please reach out to Dian at rehoboth_family@att.net. Please let your church families know about Pastor/Uncle Phil and the plight of his family so they can help through prayer and giving.""",3475,30000,24,12,21,45,7

We were not wealthy to begin with but without my income so I can stay home and help with him we cannot afford the hospital bills and the cost of a much needed portable oxygen concentrator. I normally would not ask for help from anyone but when you see what cancer does to your loved one day by day it makes you want to do anything possible to comfort them.

Rally for Rebecca,https://www.gofundme.com/rally4rebecca,0,SANFRANCISCO,CA,Hello friends  family  and strangers! My name is Mercedes. I consider Becca to be one of my best friends. From all the teenage angst and drama of high school to the ‘hood (parenthood  that is)  Becca has always been there to offer words of wisdom and encouragement. Becca is one of the people who really wouldn’t hurt a fly  insisting instead that it just be shooed from her home. She’s saved many a spider when I’d be ready to kill it with fire. She inspires me with the way she is as a mother to her two children  Phae  who recently turned 7 and Adrian  who’s 4. She’s gentle  compassionate  understanding  open  and patient. All of the things I aspire to be. She’s also been there for me through many of my life’s trials including brain injury from a car crash. That’s why I’m in her corner today. As we face life halfway across the country (she’s in California while I remain in Minnesota)  we stay in touch almost daily. She informed me of her fertility appointment as she and her husband Drew were hoping to add to their family. On September 27th  2018  I  along with our friend Leticia received a text message from Becca stating she found out from her fertility doc that she has a 2.5 cm prolactin producing benign macroadenoma after a series of blood work and an MRI. I remember reading that trembling. Since then we found out that it’s actually non-prolactin producing. There are a lot of unknowns. Here’s what we do know so far  little more than a week since she sent me that text:*There’s a 90% chance that it’s non-cancerous (thankfully). We’re hoping it stays that way and no new tests reveal anything cancerous.*Some of her peripheral vision might be compromised because...*The 2.5 cm brain tumor is compressing her optic nerve  which her endocrinologist says could cause permanent damage including loss of vision.*We don’t yet know how fast the tumor is growing. Which is one reason why...*Surgery is highly likely at this point. But not a definite. Her endocrinologist stated that he will be referring her to neurosurgery once her vision test results are in.*Becca also has a Protein S deficiency which means she has an increased risk of developing blood clots adding to her concerns during and after surgery.*Due to the location of the tumor (on top of her pituitary gland  invading her sinus cavity)  it’s possible that not all of it is going to be removed during surgery. If that’s the case  radiation therapy might be used to shrink the rest of the tumor. *Recovery from the surgery itself is expected to take approximately 6 weeks. Recovery from radiation doesn’t have an exact timeline because we don’t yet know if or how much of the tumor will not be removed during surgery or if radiation will even be prescribed. As life is  many things are unexpected. There’s more obstacles that Becca and her family have been battling. First  they’re running into challenges with their health insurance coverage. Also  her 4 year old son Adrian (who was born prematurely at 28 weeks) has ADHD and is undergoing growth hormone therapy . Due to the care Adrian requires  no daycare facilities Becca interviewed this past summer were able to enroll him meaning Becca stays home to care for him. Adrian has surgery scheduled next month (November 14  2018) to correct his bilateral extropia (eye misalignment). The expected recovery is 3 days. In addition to all these health challenges  Drew is facing health challenges of his own and was on short term disability leave from work when Becca was diagnosed with the tumor. He is still on leave but anticipating his return to work any day now. Maybe you’re like me and you’re wondering what you can do to help. As you can imagine  with everything going on all at once  finances can be even more stressful. Here are some tangible needs arising out of this situation that this fundraiser campaign would assist in covering:*Whatever meds  equipment  or anything their insurance informs Becca that they won’t cover.*Transportation to and from doctor’s appointments  school (for Phae)  and necessities like groceries while Drew is at work. This is because of possible sudden complications that can occur with the tumor making driving unsafe for Becca. *Someone to act in the capacity of a PCA to help during Becca’s recovery by assisting in the household tasks Becca and Drew do on a daily basis. Laundry  general cleaning  food prep/cook meals  and caring for Becca  etc. *Grocery delivery service (or above). *The occasional baby sitter to watch Adrian and/or Phae when Becca does have doctor’s appointments or needs time to complete certain tasks before and after surgery (again if surgery is necessary).*This is my own add on but I figured  this adorable family has gone through enough with more to come. Christmas is coming right around the corner and I feel they deserve to be overwhelmed by the goodness of their family and friends. They’re going to be more than thrilled with having each other and their bond at the end of this long  arduous  journey but there’s something about the Christmas season that puts miracles on display and instills a renewed sense of hope and optimism. Let’s show our cherished  friends Becca and Drew the light at the end of the tunnel by being that light. Money isn’t the only or even the best way to show your care. I will be updating the address for the P.O. Box as soon as Drew has it set up. Cards and/or letters of encouragement  etc. will be greatly appreciated. P.S. Additionally  I know this is a long shot but if you or anyone you know works for an airline and can assist with discounts or stand by flights  that would help immensely as Becca’s mother (and friends who volunteer) will need to fly to California from Minnesota and Drew’s parents will need to fly from Pennsylvania to assist any way they can with the recovery. *Note: The campaign goal (dollar amount) may change to more or less than the original goal depending on the level of coverage received from their health insurance company and whether or not Becca needs surgery or any other treatment. We will be updating as soon as possible. Updates can also be found here:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/eutermoserfamilyblog*AS OF 10/5/2018 THIS IS THE ONLY GOFUNDME CAMPAIGN AND ONLY FUNDRAISER APPROVED BY BECCA AND DREW.

Sasha Fights Stage 4 Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/sashafightsbreastcancer,1,BRONX,NY,Hello family  friends  and supporters of Sasha  Thank you to everyone who has reached out with your overwhelming generosity and support. The donations and outpouring of love from people who know and care about Sasha has been incredible. Sasha has been undergoing a lot but with her community  she has been able to endure. We'd like to update you about Sasha's condition. As you know  she was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last fall. Her oncologist recommended palliative chemotherapy which would help to alleviate her pain  but not treat the cancer  essentially saying Sasha was out of options. Sasha refuses to give up. She has spent the last months searching for a surgical oncologist  someone who would offer some hope and other treatment options. The good news is she finally found one that will provide her with radiosurgery and who also takes Medicaid. Sasha began this treatment this week in NYC at the Cancer Treatment Center NY. In other good news: Sasha's story was featured in the Jamaica Observer on World Cancer Day  February 4th. Please share with friends and family and let them know about the campaign.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BtdudLag4_O/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1jlmjmwf8ejah Here are some things Sasha still needs help with: Medical: The Medicaid covers the costs of the treatment only but everything else  including scans  bloodwork  tests  is her out-of-pocket responsibility. Housing: Sasha has a place to stay in the Bronx but the surgical oncologist is in midtown Manhattan. Part of the stress on her will be traveling back and forth from the Bronx to Manhattan daily after intensive medical procedures. If anyone in the community can suggest housing that’s closer  please let us know. Food/transportation: Sasha is still not able to work  so any donations to help with these necessities is greatly appreciated. The GoFundMe funds have generously gone towards Sasha’s expenses for medical bills  travel  meals  and immunotherapy which has been helping to relieve some of her pain. Thank you again to those who have been helping our dear sister Sasha to make it this far. Any donations or suggestions that can help her at this critical time of need are very much appreciated. Keep thinking of her and sharing her story. We know she is strong because of you. With gratitude  Team Sasha / February 2019_________________________________________________Dear friends  family  and supporters of Sasha Sasha has been in New York City for over a month  still awaiting cancer treatment. The positive news is: Sasha's working with an oncologist from NYU-Langone who sees her at Bellevue Hospital. She will begin aggressive chemotherapy on November 20th. And she has been approved for Medicaid which will cover some of these medical costs. We have to wait to see what expenses will become patient responsibility. The downside: Her oncologist doesn't think the chemotherapy will affect the cancer. She's prescribing chemo only to ease Sasha's pain. She's not recommending surgery because the cancer has grown too large. The chemotherapy has been scheduled so far in advance because her doctor is requesting Sasha build up her immune system before chemo can be done. Sasha has had to repeat multiple blood tests and scans. They are causing her extreme pain  and she is very underweight. It's been frustrating having to wait for answers. Things are slow-moving  but Sasha is lifted by knowing that you all love and support her so much. Here are some ways you can continue to help: Your donations have generously helped Sasha pay for meals and transportation to and from the hospital. She's on a vegan/vegetarian/plant-based diet. 1) The cost of her food supply is expensive  groceries range between $100-$250 a week. 2) Transportation back and forth from uptown to the downtown hospital multiple times a week is also expensive. There are times when she is too weak to walk. 3) Sasha needs more information. A second-opinion from a doctor who may know about more effective trial medicines. Bellevue was the only hospital that would receive her. If anyone has any contacts or knowledge in this area please let us know. Everything helps at this point. Thank you to everyone who has generously donated  to the hundred of you and more. Keep sharing her story to friends  family  schools  media  organizations. Contact someone from the team if you have other thoughts on how to help Sasha. Email goteamsasha@gmail.com  or Team Sasha Facebook. This is a very crucial time. Please keep her in your hearts and prayers. With gratitude  Team Sasha / November 2018__________________________________________________________________Dear friends and family  SASHA IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE.  Sasha has STAGE 4 BREAST CANCER. This is metastatic advanced stage breast cancer that has spread to her lymph nodes. For anyone who has ever been touched by our Sister Sasha  she needs you right now in the fight to help save her life. Sasha is in New York City. She has sought emergency treatment at NYU's Langone Medical Center.  The emergency doctors have asked her to find an oncologist and prepare for surgery immediately. She has been unable to secure an appointment with an oncologist because she is waiting for her medical insurance to be approved. It's been a week since the emergency doctors requested she get surgery. Sasha is with family in NYC  but navigating the US medical system has slowed down the process and has wasted precious time in addressing her serious condition.  She cannot delay. We cannot let money delay her treatment. We anticipate that she will need to pay for the oncologist visit out of pocket now  and partial billing for the surgery and the hospital stay.Some have asked for her medical bills cost. We don't have that answer right now. We will update this information as it becomes available. Just know that because of the seriousness here  she will be in recovery for the next year. Which means she will not be working. Even if her insurance covers the costs of the medical procedures  there are still many additional costs she will be up against after surgery.  We anticipate she will need funds for food  transportation for hospital visits  medicines  possibly at home nursing care. Every cent will matter.Sasha is an angel  she's a gift  she's been a light for so many of us.  We need this message to reach everyone at her home in Jamaica  and all of the people and places she has touched.  If anyone has access to the Jamaican media  please get in touch with us. We need this campaign to accelerate. It's urgent. Continue to pray for Sasha  but she desperately needs funds to get through this next stage.  Sasha is very thankful for all the support she's received so far.  Thank you for everyone who has been sharing and sending this campaign. Keep it going.  We know you all want to speak with her  but so that she can focus on treatment  please direct your questions or support to someone on her Team. You can email goteamsasha@gmail.com   or post messages at Team Sasha Facebook    or get in touch with one of us directly and we'll get your message to her.  Thank you from all of our hearts at Team Sasha/ October 2018Shocko PhillipsIsa PhillipsKimesha JohnsonHensley CampbellRuel AshburnTissana DacresAva-Gale SimpsonMarjorie DallasLaurie Thomas Hear Sasha's words from one week ago:,6612,25000,13,26,111,628,7
Maryann&#x2019;s fight with Osteosarcoma,https://www.gofundme.com/Roccostrong,1,SELDEN,NY,I would like to give you a little background on my mother; she is a 56 y/o wife  mother  grandmother and sister to a very loving family. She spent most of her life dedicating to her family and putting everyone else’s needs before her own. My mother never had any serious medical conditions or social history that would alter her life or lead to risk factors associated with other diseases. She is a devoted employee that never stopped; she always worked two jobs one as a cosmetologist and the other as a teacher assistant for medically challenged children. She has always been this incredible  strong  hardworking woman. Nothing ever got in my mother's way; she always strived and pushed herself to make sure her family was secure. Now leading to the battle that we did not choose  my mom’s fight with osteosarcoma began back in July of 2016 from what we thought was just some calcification in an unexpected area on the gingiva (gums). One morning in 2015 my mom noticed a bump on her gum right above her central left incisor (left front tooth). At the time the word cancer was never even a thought  after all she has always kept up with her dental hygiene and health.  My mother made an appointment with the dentist and endodontist and they were inconclusive in their diagnosis. At the time they didn’t seem like it was anything to be concerned about. She had obtained CT scans and partial removal of what they thought was some sort of calcification. But unfortunately the growth had grown back and even bigger this time. Now my mom was starting to experience discomfort such as temperature sensitivity and neuropathic facial pain. The endodontist sent my mother to a specialist (maxillofacial surgeon) to obtain a biopsy of the calcification. The maxillofacial surgeons initial attempt of the biopsy after 5 weeks of pathology reviews came back inconclusive. Upon submitting a second biopsy  which consisted of a larger specimen sample it was discovered after two weeks of further pathology evaluation  the teams final diagnosis was the one word that was dreaded the most Cancer (Osteosarcoma). My family was in disbelief and absolute shock by this devastating news. After a few weeks of pure denial and sadness  we as a family pushed through to do whatever we had to do to face this dreadful disease with fortitude and faith. The battle was on and we were determined to make several appointments with different cancer specialist to get as many professional opinions as possible  but they all came up with the same course of action  the cancer had to be removed. In August 2016 was the first surgery for removal of the unidentifiable localized cancer and they told my mom she didn’t need any chemo or radiation because the cancer was considered unidentifiable. The surgeon stated they cleared the margins and this type of cancer is normally treated just with surgery. During some time in November 2016  she started to feel like something was growing below her left nostril. The surgeons voted it to be normal postoperative changes from the surgery labeling it as scar tissue. After several subsequent recurring visits some deformity started to show and they finally suspected something was not right. After a CT scan in December of 2016 and April 2017 they came to the conclusion that the cancer recurred and is located in the left premaxilla adjacent to the left nostril. In May of 2017 was the second resection and reconstructive surgery to remove the recurrent cancer from the primary site. The reconstructive surgery consisted of the removal of her left fibula to reconstruct her upper jaw and palate. After that resection we waited to see if she needed radiation or chemotherapy based on the pathology reports and recommendations from the tumor board. Once confirmed  it was decided by the tumor board to be treated with proton radiation. She began treatment in August of 2017 through October 2017. After receiving radiation treatment and multiple PET/CT scans with results showing no signs of cancer  excitement grew that she was in the clear. Unfortunately in February upon a normal visit with her surgeon they noticed some signs of tissue abnormality and immediately followed a biopsy in February of 2018  which came back inconclusive. With not much concern based on the inconclusive result of the reports my mom continued on her path to recovery. In June of 2018  she went for a follow up PET/CT scans  which delivered terrifying results. With abnormalities on the PET/CT scans  she was sent for blood tests and received the news the cancer metastasized (multiple sites). Upon this terrible news chemo was immediately started in early July. Being the strong woman that my mom is she endured chemotherapy very well up until October 31st 2018 when she became extremely neutropenic and ended up in the hospital for 6 days. Still receiving chemotherapy and battling this terrible Cancer she managed to continue working as a teacher's assistant working with autistic children from grades 1-2. After getting out of the hospital we agreed she must take a medical leave of absence and focus on getting through this journey to recovery. As we all know traveling  medical expenses and the cost of living (especially in New York) is never easy. With everyday bills and medical expenses adding up it can be overwhelming  as we all may know.  Worrying about expenses is the last thing we want for her to deal with. Osteosarcoma is one of the rarest cancers out there  especially in adults. Because of the limited research on this cancer we want to seek out multiple medical opinions and treatment options outside of New York to get my mom the best treatment plan as possible. We will be seeking out opinions at Dana Farber in Massachusetts and MD Anderson in Texas as well as immunotherapy drugs  which is not covered by most insurance companies. So we are reaching out for help. My mom has always donated to causes to help others in need and has been a giver all of her life. I am hoping that through this page we can raise enough money to take some of the financial burden off of her and my father as she continues through this journey to fight and win against this Cancer. All and any donations are deeply appreciated by my family to help my mother seek the medical treatment needed and to support getting through these difficult times. Thank you in advance for your consideration and support. Sincerely The Rocco Family,17847,20000,17,89,151,589,5

Victims of Home Invasion Need Help,https://www.gofundme.com/victims-of-home-invasion-need-help,2,SANDUSKY,OH,Earlier this week  my Aunt's home was burglarized while my young cousins were held hostage at gunpoint. Physically  they are fine and both perpetrators were apprehended thanks to my 20 year old cousin who was able to hide and call the police quickly after they broke in. It has been a whirl-wind of emotions for my cousins and their mother   who rushed home from work when she got the call of what was happening. While my family is so very grateful that no one was hurt and everyone got out of this situation alive  this was (as you can imagine)quite a bit of a set-back for them. Property was damaged  t.v.s were broken  priceless items completely destroyed  money stolen (and lost due to missing a few days of work to re-coop and work with detectives) among other things. I am asking anyone who is able and willing  PLEASE help this wonderful little family get past this traumatic event and back on their feet and SHOW them that there is still a little bit of humanity in the world!! Any little bit helps!! Thank you  in advance.,285,2000,12,14,11,66,7
Medical expenses for our daughter,https://www.gofundme.com/bxkcre-medical-expenses-for-our-daughter,9,CHILDRESS,TX,On August 21st 2018 our beautiful daughter  Danielle  attempted suicide. On the outside she was happy  loving  selfless  outgoing  and beautiful. But on the inside she has been fighting demons and hiding so much pain. That night she didn't feel like fighting anymore and decided she needed to end her life. By the grace of God she was found passed out on the floor  after taking 2 full bottles of pills  before she made it to her bedroom to only be found the next morning after it was too late. She was rushed to the ER in time to pump her stomach but still had to be airlifted to Lubbock and admitted into pediatric ICU with heart complications  she spent 3 days in ICU then sent to a pediatric psychiatric clinic in Amarillo. After 5 days she was able to come home. Since then Danielle has been having to see a family counselor every week and a psychiatrist once a month to regulate her depression and anxiety meds. She is still having heart problems and needing to see a cardiologist. For those who know us  we don't ask for help.

Team Womkey,https://www.gofundme.com/team-womkey,8,DENVER,CO,Welcome to Team Womkey: Let's Make a Baby.The Situation: As many of you know  the wombat and I (the monkey) have been trying for almost four years to add a child to our family. We've exhausted every possible avenue except for this last one: IVF (in vitro fertilization). Please Consider Contributing: We feel strongly about growing Team Womkey. We're a solid family and are very much in love  with each other  our life  and our two fur-babies  Roland and Arthur. We've dedicated countless hours and almost $20k cash money to researching fertility and exploring treatment options. We very much want to be parents -- a joy and happiness that will be possible for us with IVF. What You'll Get: Seriously good karma for helping a family realize their dream. And who knows? Maybe we'll name baby womkey after you. Infertility has been a long road  full of grief  frustration  and hopelessness. We could not have made it this far without the support of our community -- thank you for being in our lives. With your continued support  we will make our dream come true.  Any amount is received with profound gratitude -- as are your good wishes -- and will go explicitly toward the IVF procedures and medications (approximately $30k+. Our insurance does not cover a dime).We begin this next stage with love  hope  gratitude  and grace. Thank you for being a part of our journey.,4255,30000,15,14,104,476,7

Dan,https://www.gofundme.com/uaj2gx-dan,1,FALMOUTH,KY,Been fighting cancer well over a year. They put me through 6 rounds of chemo which lasted less than 8 months before it came back. Then I was put on a pill which actually reversed the cancer up until a little over a month ago and the cancer came back again. This time doctor told me if I had waited a day longer my kidneys would have shut down. Anyway the cancer is very aggressive form of lymphoma . Next they gave me a Heavier dose of chemo which is where I  now. My platelet levels and hemoglobin levels are staying low thus keeping me in the hospital.They took bone marrow biopsy to see the possible problem as they are not sure if the cancer is killing everything off or if it's my antibodies or if it's just remnants of the chemo . Hopefully I will get to start a new pill but it's not yet FDA-approved.I am going on 2 months in the hospital so you can only imagine getting behind on just about everything.Thanks and God Bless!,1095,3000,12,37,22,144,7

We are in a bit of dire straits  as our only source of income was suddenly halted.Jesse is disabled and in the process of filing for disability and is unable to work  due to continued thyroid cancer treatment and a myriad of other health issues. My employer  suddenly and without notice  shut down operations for a company restructuring that was said to take only 2 days. Our last day of work was September 18  2018. It is  now  almost 3 weeks later. In the meantime  I have been submitting resumes and have already completed a promising interview. Unfortunately  because of this  I have been unable to pay rent. I did receive a partial check  but not the full amount  and it didn’t include late penalties  that are due to me and it appears I may not recover that money. We have already been served a 60 day notice and will either have to relocate to rural South Carolina (definitely not LGBTQ friendly) or figure out a way to catch up our bills before we have to vacate our home on November 1. In addition  our health insurance was cancelled by the state  and Jesse hasn’t been able to see her doctors  obtain her thyroid hormone  which keeps her alive  nor any of her other required medications.We have both called California our home for 14 years and we are heartbroken at the idea of having to leave our adopted family and our freedom to live in peace.Please don’t feel obligated  but anything helps.Please share this  you are able.We appreciate your time ❤️,345,5000,5,7,12,207,7

Friend in Need When Cancer Hits Home,https://www.gofundme.com/a-friend-in-need-after-hysterectomy,0,CANTON,GA,Receiving a cancer diagnosis is never easy to hear. It impacts not just the person diagnosed  but all the people that are close to them. In the case of my friend Heather  the person impacted most (outside herself) is her wife Jenn. The Start of a Journey Heather and Jenn met in high school. They had an instant connection. Jenn likes to joke that Heather took her home for dinner one day  and she never left. They have been together for over 25 years  and have built a life and a business together. The Road So Far...What makes this less of a typical love story is that Jenn has Cerebral Palsy. As the years have gone by  her joints have decided to cooperate less and less  and she has been bound to a wheelchair to get around for quite a while. This means that Heather is her full-time  primary caretaker. You rarely see one without the other. They are a package deal. For the last decade  they have been building their own sound and digital editing business. They made the decision many years ago to leave work in corporate America and pursue their dreams  which makes their income stream unpredictable at times. It also means they do not have insurance. A few months ago  Heather was experiencing some severe abdominal pain. She is the type of person that will tough it through most things  but this was bad. She had no choice but to go to the doctor. What they discovered was that Heather’s cervix was dilated to the point that it looked like she was giving birth. A very large polyp had essentially put a stopper over her cervix. That polyp however  turned out to be a life saver. If that had not prompted the visit to the doctor  Heather’s cancer may not have been found for years  and would have progressed much further. But because of that polyp  Heather was diagnosed at Stage One Uterine Cancer (something the oncologist she was referred to almost never sees). Unfortunately  this life saver cost them about $8000  out of pocket. During the process of tests  biopsies  game-planning with the oncologist  Heather and Jenn began the arduous process of applying for Medicaid. They were assured by the doctor's office that they were sure to be approved  as this was a women’s health issue  and should be fully covered. She was not approved. After weeks of back and forth  they were basically told she had the “wrong kind of cancer”  that because it hadn't originated in the cervix then she would have to wait until it was cervical cancer and then she would be approved.  Now that they've been denied however they've been told they can't reapply for 2 years so that door is closed regardless of any further diagnosis. Now what.... So they paid for everything out of pocket. Heather got scheduled for her hysterectomy  and they paid almost $20 000 for the surgery  hospital costs and anesthesia. This was money they did not have to spare. They arranged for family and friends to tag team taking care of both Heather and Jenn  because Heather cannot do any of the things she has done for Jenn  because she cannot lift or pull or push while she is recovering. Four days into recovery their long-time client decided to put their contract on hold  and that meant what little money they had coming in right now was not going to be coming in any more. Also during her recovery period  to add insult to injury  the AC/furnace unit in the house went out  apparently damaged by rats that had quietly infiltrated in the last few months and have chewed up just about everything. It’s not covered by their homeowners insurance so that’s another $10-15 000 to get rid of the rats and squirrels and replace the duct work and units that were damaged. Heather still has follow up visits that they don’t know how they will pay for. They have no income coming in right now since Heather can't work right now and can't help Jenn get to necessary appointments and meetings.  They are not the type of people to ask for help  but this goes beyond being in over their heads. We are asking for help on behalf of our friends. It’s never easy to ask for this kind of help  especially when you have been independent for so long. Thank you in advance for any help and for sharing this to spread the word.,2000,50000,10,4,21,170,7

Help Afford Neurologist/Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/help-afford-neurologist,0,LEWISVILLE,NC,I’ve been having eye issues such as massive lights flashing  stabbing pains and burning sensations  and I have had these since March this year  and in July I started having Migraines and it’s gotten to the point that none of them get any better. I had a eye doctor appt today at Town Center Vision and the eye doctor said it wasn’t good. There's something neurologically wrong with me. He did a neurological test of both my eyes and I failed in two crucial spots of my eyes. My left eye was a little worse off in the peripheral test but the biggest concern happened to be in the same area on both eyes and were in the same quadrant. He's making a referral to see a neurologist because he said I'm gonna have to have scans of my brain. To rule out majorly serious issues such as forms of brain cancer  Multiple Sclerosis  and other degenerative disorders. He said all physical tests of my eyes came back fine and the referral to the neurologist is 215 just to talk to them not including the imaging and other tests they may produce.  I don’t know what else to do man. I have hit my absolute rock bottom and nothing has gone right for me within the last two years. And of course without insurance and a job (due to other health issues such as chronic pain  clinical anxiety and my high blood pressure) I don’t know how to afford or go about any of this. My eye doctor contacted the neurologist and said a doctors nurse from Salem Neurological on Monday 10/9/2018 is going to contact me to set up my first appointment and said that just a consultation will be around 213 dollars and some change. They then said they will make separate appointments just for the testing  such as spinal fluid testing  imaging done of my head and what not  to which I’m going to have to pay most of it upfront as they are hundreds-if not thousands of dollars to charge because I don’t have insurance. My eye doctor  Dr.Jameson said this all needs to be done in the next two weeks based on how long my eye has been bothering me. And how it’s progressively worse. Every update I get I will update on this campaign  every paper relating to testing/appointments and such will be posted  a long with any and all appointments that I’m able to go to will be documented here and such to protect the people who donate and show all receipts from the neurologist to show where my the money is going towards. Firstly I’m just trying to get enough to see the neurologist first and then go from there. Thank you all for your help and support. The people who have been my friend since we were kids know that I hate asking for help and that I’m trying my best to get by as much as I can. My heart goes out to every single one of you who shares so that this can reach those who KNOW why the American health system sucks  this way maybe one day someone can fix it and stand by those like me  and can help all of this people in need.,630,1500,13,42,21,122,7
Support Dena &amp; The Siress Family,https://www.gofundme.com/support-dena-and-the-siress-family,6,TUCSON,AZ,In June of this year the Siress' found out that Dena has a lesion on her brain. At the time they were 32 weeks pregnant with Raelynn and doctors initially were wanting to take Raelynn by c-section almost immediately. God quickly intervened and changed the hearts of their doctors and Raelynn stayed put until July 25th when she was 37 weeks. Dena had an MRI with contrast at the beginning of August which showed that the lesion did not grow or enhance significantly. Shortly after getting this information they decided to get a second opinion from the Mayo Clinic. After meeting with the doctors at Mayo they agreed that they felt Mayo was the best option to pursue treatment. While surgery is not neccessary it is the best option. At the end of August Dena had an additional couple of MRIs to map her brain and assist the doctors in preparing for surgery. Towards the end of September they met with the team of surgeons and surgery was looking like it would be at the end of September. Plans changed and the doctors scheduled surgery for October 10th. Dena will be in the hospital for a few days and there is the potential for a second surgery to resect more of the lesion.At this time the doctors do not believe the lesion is cancer but without a byopsy they do not know. Once the resection is done the lesion will be tested and they will have a better idea of what future treatment will consist of. Dena will likely have either radiation or chemo or a combination of both.We ask for prayers for the doctors as Dena goes into surgery and that God will guide them. We also ask for prayers for Dena and Raelynn through this procedure. We have set up this account to help the Siress family with medical expenses along with all the other expenses that accompany this difficult time.,2500,5000,12,50,27,168,7
Gigi&apos;s ALS Battle,https://www.gofundme.com/gigi039s-als-battle,7,OXFORD,CT,Gigi Sakr is a vivacious and fiercely independent woman who conquered countless obstacles in her life to become an entrepreneur  single-mother  and friend-to-all. In the prime of her life 3 years ago  Gigi was diagnosed with ALS  a debilitating neurological disease that slowly erodes muscle function. Extremely rare and eventually fatal  it currently has no cure. Within months of diagnosis  Gigi had to close the business she started to seek full-time treatment. Her only daughter  Gizelle  gave up her couture gown business in Egypt in order to come home and care for her mother. For months she slept by her mother’s side in the hospital  working tirelessly as her advocate. She remains her sole caretaker  shouldering the enormous financial burden of her mother’s treatment by working overtime during the week in New York and spending as many weekends as she can at home. Because ALS is rare  severe  and misunderstood  many of the treatments currently available for this devastating disease are not covered by either Medicaid or private insurance. The rarity of this disease also means that the research is chronically underfunded  meaning that treatments within an arm’s reach are delayed simply due to a lack of resources. Thanks to initiatives like the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge  enough funds were recently raised to release a treatment called Radicava  which slows the progression of the disease. This treatment has been a godsend for Gigi; for her  waiting for a cure is a race against the clock. She most recently lost her ability to walk  as well as almost all of her hand function. Her breathing is also in decline  and she will inevitably need a tracheostomy. Despite this overwhelming situation  Gigi and Gizelle remain hopeful  and Gigi remains mentally sharp  witty and vibrant as ever. As the research for a cure speeds ahead  they know that they simply need to buy Gigi enough time to survive until this cure is found. In this situation  “buying” really is the operative word because the only way to survive the wait  is with treatments like Radicava which most insurances do not cover. This means that though the family is assisted by Medicaid  Gizelle is carrying an enormous financial burden to pay for these lifesaving treatments. Devastatingly  this also means that Gizelle can’t spend as much time with her mother as she would like because of how hard she needs to work to pay these medical bills. Please consider making a donation to support this family as they fight the toughest battle of their lives.,890,10000,7,9,14,173,7

He is one of the best people I know. Our Uncle Dan wasn't acting himself and was very weak.  On Tuesday  Oct 2  he was brought to the ER and within just a couple hours  we found out that he has 3 brain tumors and he was diagnosed with brain cancer. After further testing  it was discovered that he has a very aggressive stage 4 brain cancer.  This is a terminal cancer.  The news has devastated our family.  On Wednesday  we decided as a family for him to have brain surgery to try and reduce the size of the tumors. Not doing the surgery would give him maybe at most a few weeks to live. Doing the surgery will help to prolong his life just a little longer. He had the brain surgery yesterday.  The surgery went well but since it involves the brain  he is still very critical.   Our Uncle Dan is the most genuine  caring  loving  sweetest person we know. He takes care of his family and would give anyone the shirt off his back. With everything that has happened in the matter of a couple days  medical bills and other expenses have accumulated very quickly.  He always takes care of everyone else  now it's our turn to take care of him.

The Gray Family Needs Your Help,https://www.gofundme.com/the-gray-family-needs-your-help,8,FRESNO,CA,The Gray Family Needs your Help Jason and Kyndra Gray are the proud parents of four wonderful children. They have their own business  they volunteer  Jason brews beer  and together they do their best to keep their household happy  welcoming  and filled with friends.Unfortunately  their oldest Padyn  has been ill for quite some time without the family realizing it. Thinking Padyn to just be naturally thin  recently through a series of medical check-ups  it was discovered that Pady’s lack of nutrition has been affecting her organs  including her brain  bones and heart with potentially severe health repercussions.  Padyn has been hospitalized as a result.Padyn’s treatment plan means spending the next few months in San Diego at the Rady’s Children’s hospital. This has thrown the Gray family into a bit of an upheaval. Kyndra is going to spend all of that time in San Diego with Padyn  advocating for her health and providing what comfort and support she can to her daughter.Jason has stepped away from his business and is taking a leave of absence. He now has the full-time job of caring for his household of children while also planning weekly visits to San Diego when possible to care for his daughter. This GoFundMe’s purpose is to alleviate the financial pressure the Gray family is facing on Padyn’s road to recovery.If the Gray family has touched your life in any way  they truly need help and this is your opportunity to love them in a tangible way.  Any amount you feel comfortable with contributing (or just the prayers needed to help the family through this hopefully short treatment period and recovery time) will be joyfully and thankfully received.Thanks to each and every one of you in advance for your kindness and consideration.,13155,25000,15,53,113,550,7

Mike Dahlberg Family Benefit Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/my-brother039s-family-medical-bills,6,MOORHEAD,MN,Multiple medical emergencies affecting an entire familyI am creating this GoFundMe page in hopes of helping out my brother  Mike  and his family.  This past year has been a tough one for them and they are still in the middle of treatments and follow-up care that have affected them emotionally  as well as financially.   His wife  and each of his 3 children  has had to struggle with medical issues recently.  My hope is that I can help him by sharing his story and allowing others to donate financially  to assist them with the multiple medical bills that they have accrued  and continue to accrue with ongoing medical appointments and treatments  yet to come.  Most recently  his wife  Shannon  was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2018.  The cancer has moved to her lymph nodes and she is currently on round 7  of 16 necessary rounds of chemotherapy.  Once that is finished  she will have surgery  followed by 6 weeks of daily radiation therapy.  Shannon continues to impress all of us with her strength and positive attitude. One month prior to Shannon’s diagnosis  his oldest daughter  Abby  experienced stroke like symptoms  while at home.  A CT scan and MRI were done during her emergency room visit and the doctor's discovered a tumor on the back of Abby's brain. It was determined that she had an Acoustic Neuroma - a benign tumor.  Due to the large size of the tumor  surgery was scheduled and performed at Mayo last month.  The doctors were expecting that this was one tumor but as surgery progressed  they instead found several tumors that were entangled in her facial and hearing nerves  further complicating the surgery  which ended up taking 10 hours.  Doctors removed 90% of the tumors and the remaining tumors will need to be shrunk using a gamma knife  which uses radiation to shrink the tumors.  She will need genetic testing to establish if the tumors are likely to grow back  later in life.  Abby has lost all of her hearing in her right ear and has mild paralysis on the right side of her face.  She is unable to work for the next 3 months  at a minimum  and had to put her college education on hold for now.  She has such a beautiful spirit and is taking cues from her mother and appreciating each day as it comes.  A few months prior to this  Mike’s youngest daughter  Olivia  needed to have spinal surgery in April of this year.  Doctors had spent the past couple of years  trying to correct a curve in her spine but it reached a point where the curvature was at 63% and the writing was on the wall – Olivia would require spinal fusion surgery.  They traveled to Gillette Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis and stayed for 5 days  supporting Olivia through her 10 hour surgery and recovery in the hospital.   Olivia continues to heal at home and will follow up with doctors at Gillette next month.  This sweet  young girl has a contagious smile and continues to be thankful for each day.Lastly  Mike’s son  Sean  broke his wrist last year and needed to have surgery to place a plate and pins in his wrist.  Surgery was successful in stabilizing his wrist and allowing full use of his wrist  which is important to a young man who is attending college to be a nurse.   This young man wants to help others and has a bright future in front of him. I truly appreciate help from anyone who has the means to help my brother and his family. No donation is too small and will help provide relief  no matter the amount. I know that Mike and his family will be so grateful for any donations.  If you are unable to contribute financially  please share this link and know that prayers are always welcome.  Thank you!Lisa,3995,30000,12,13,44,277,5
Move Mountains for Nick,https://www.gofundme.com/rrtpe8-move-mountains-for-nick,6,ALTAMONTESPRINGS,FL,Some of you may not have heard that my soulmate has been hospitalized and is now diagnosed with degenerate disk disease . He’s lost complete range of motion in his right leg and it’s starting to spread. He’s been out of commission and unable to work for almost a month now. We’ve been in and out of hospitals cause the pain gets unbearable some days. Surgeon estimates if surgery isn’t done as soon as possible he could permanently be paralyzed and won’t be able to walk again  however  there’s still hope. He got an experimental trial done last week and the nerves in his spine responded well to the treatment  however insurance doesn’t cover the costs of the treatments and surgery  so please guys anything small towards his healing would be such a blessing.

Todos unidos por Brenda,https://www.gofundme.com/todos-unidos-por-brenda,3,MIAMI,FL,Hola a todos  mi nombre es Brenda María Urdaneta León  soy Venezolana  vivo en Maracaibo-Venezuela. En Septiembre 2018  mediante estudios descubrieron en mi organismo una Lesión Ocupante de Espacios Tiroideos sugestivos de Adenomas. Sin embargo  el dia 15 de Octubre de 2018  mediante el resultado de Biopsia fui diagnosticada con un Linfoma no Hogdking difuso de células pequeñas a medianas inmunofenotipo B. No es para nadie un secreto los Sucesos Inhumanos que diariamente vivimos en Venezuela  en materia social  económica  alimentaria  entre otros muchos aspectos. Siendo así  en Materia de Salud  hemos pedido todos los Venezolanos Ayuda Humanitaria. En mi caso no es la excepción  poder tener acceso a la Salud  lejos de encontrar algún tipo de alivio a mi padecimiento incrementa negativamente cada segundo que pasa mi situación  obtener estudios médicos cuyos pagos en moneda extranjera resulta para mi inaccesible  hace pensar por un momento que tener salud en Venezuela es un lujo que pocos pueden gozar  aunado a ello  inexistencia de medicamentos e importación de Materiales Quirúrgicos simplemente para poder gozar de un Tratamiento Médico que por Derechos Humanos  tengo a bien disfrutar. Por todas y cada una de estas razones  tanto mi Familia como mi persona necesitamos de la ayuda de cada uno de ustedes  para poder luchar por mi futuro y estar presente en el de mi hijo. Por ello  solicito de las oraciones de cada uno de ustedes y de su contribución económica  pues el Tratamiento Correcto para mi recuperación se encuentra fuera de mi país  y por eso los fondos recaudados a traves de esta campaña serán utilizados para poder salir de mi país Venezuela y cubrir parte de los costos que se originan en concepto de intervención quirúrgica  transplantes  quimioterapia y radioterapia; en virtud que aqui en Venezuela  no existen los medicamentos ni menos aún el tratamiento idoneo para poder sanarme. Por ello  con cada contribución estarias apoyandome para poder llegar hasta España  y en ese lugar sere atendida por un equipo medico y poder sanarme. Mi tratamiento espera por mí y para poder salir de Venezuela y empezarlo necesito de ti  en razón que no tengo los recursos necesarios para poder cubrir los boletos de vuelo para poder llegar a España  ni menos aún cubrir parte de los costos elevados que genera mi tratamiento médico. Necesito del apoyo de todos para poder ser tratada.  Aun tengo mucho camino que recorrer y eso también depende de Ti....Dios les bendiga.,855,20000,21,4,34,96,7

Jael  one of the most compassionate  generous  and kind-hearted beings in the universe  has been dealt a tough hand. Those of us who know her understand that she is a fighter  but this fight will be a long  rocky  and definitely expensive one.At the end of September  Jael became very sick and was diagnosed with aggressive Stage IV Rapidly Progressive Metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It has metastasized and spread beyond the breast tissue. She has just begun chemo  but we do not know how things will play out. What we do know is that Jael is putting all of her energy and drive into fighting this insidious disease and can use as much support and love as possible.Jael  being the selfless person that she is  has helped countless people throughout her life as an advocate for recovery and social justice. She has offered everything she has to people in need; no matter what their situation  she is always ready to help with an empathetic heart and nonjudgmental spirit. She has created “gofundmes” for literally dozens of her friends  and it is now time for us to pay her back. We have the chance  and honestly the obligation  to step up and return the favor.Please help Jael through this battle with cancer. Whether you can give a lot  a little  or contribute by keeping her in your hearts  anything helps. Jael is in tremendous pain right now and is unable to work. In a month  she will be let go from her job and lose her health insurance. I’m sure everyone understands how expensive cancer treatment is  and the last thing we want Jael to focus on right now is whether or not she will be able to afford her rent  her treatment  and other expenses.We will update this page as time passes and we receive more news. In the meantime  please spread the word and spread the love. Give what you can  send messages of support— whatever you’ve got.This gofundme has been set up by friends of Jael’s  but the money raised is going directly into Jael’s bank account.

Jerry and Brenda Lumley,https://www.gofundme.com/jerry-and-brenda-lumley,8,MACON,GA,LET'S SURPRISE BRENDA AND JERRY!As many of you know  our dear friend Jerry was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in March of 2017. You may remember he had a very tough heart surgery last spring. The cancer has spread and now attacked the other 2 heart values. Fortunately he has found a heart surgeon at Mayo in Rochester Minnesota.  The group there understands the connection of his specific cancer and the heart. If there are no complications they will be in Rochester for a minimum of 2 weeks  but as we know from their last experience that could easily be longer. Many of you have asked what you can do to help. If the surgery was in Macon  we could take food to their house. Since they will be away  we would like to take up a little collection to help with meals while they are so far from home.  As a true  ol' fashion southern gentlemen  Jerry would graciously accept a meal being brought  but would hesitate to take any monetary contributions. Therefore  we would LOVE to SURPRISE them with a love offering to take the place of meals that we would traditionally take to the house. We would like to present them with the funds on Saturday  November 17th at their family Thanksgiving get together. However we will leave the page open throughout their stay in Rochester. Thank you all for your love and support. Please look to Jerry's Caring Bridge page for updates from Brenda. As always your prayers are so very appreciated. FamilyPapa and DavisJerry and BrendaWorking in the AirportWorking at in the doctor's waiting areaJerry and CarolinePapa offering a little homework help,4585,5000,12,92,59,358,7

My Brain Tumor Grew Back,https://www.gofundme.com/brain-tumor-grew-back,1,CHICAGO,IL,My name is LeeAnna (Lea) Ciastko. I had a craniotomy December 27th  2017 to remove a brain tumor. Unfortunately  2 new brain tumors grew back. My MRI on September 27th  2018 showed a new tumor (close to the original)  a second new tumor (in the middle of my brain)  some tumor cells in the lining of my brain  and finally tumor cells at the end of my spine (due to the movement of spinal fluid through my brain). Thankfully  I had a successful craniotomy on October 2nd  2018 in order to remove the operable tumor (the one close to the original spot). I have yet to meet with my radiation oncologist and my primary oncologists to discuss my new form of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. I am hoping to do that within the next 6 weeks  my surgery recovery period. My primary oncologists told me the original goal of my cancer treatments was to cure my cancer  but now since it has progressed  the new goal of my new cancer treatments is to keep my cancer at bay  so I can live longer. When asked about an amount of time  one of my primary oncologists said  given his experience with this form of tumor  to measure my time in “years ” would be more on the optimistic side. Well  I’m a total optimist and I plan on doing everything within my power to help myself both physically  and mentally! After my first craniotomy  I did a solo standup show at a Second City Training Center Theater that I called  “It’s My Cancer and I’ll Laugh If I Want To.” This time around  I want to put on a different solo standup show called  “When Life Gives You Cancer  Make Comedy!” I truly believe I am lucky and I want to spend my time doing what I love the most  which is making people happy. This GoFundMe is to help me with my cost of living  while I'm not able to work.  Any donation  read  or share is greatly appreciated; thank you for your time!,10733,10000,22,107,101,269,7
My Lyme Disease Treatments,https://www.gofundme.com/mrjvq-lyme-disease-treatments,7,LOUISVILLE,CO,"I have been suffering from Lyme Disease for almost 4 years. I have tried several treatment protocols but as of today my symptoms are still intense and debilitating. A lot of folks don't understand Lyme Disease  not even the doctors. The symptoms vary from person to person. It's called the \great imitator\"" because the symptoms range from loss of muscle function  flu like symptoms  fever  brain fog  extreme fatigue  muscle pain  joint pain are but a few but they are the main symptoms I suffer with. Treatments vary from antibiotics to herbal protocols. I have had them all  with no success. This disease has ruined my life. Thankfully there is a treatment protocol offered by a clinic in Utah. It is the same protocol that has been offered in Germany and Mexico for years  but for a fraction of the cost. The protocol in Germany is well over $50 000 and in Mexico it's over $25 000 which does not include airfare and accommodations. It is highly effective and I am hopeful that I'll be able to raise the necessary funds to participate. The clinic's website is:  http://lifehealthcenters.com/ They have a 90% success rate. Unfortunately I have exhausted all but a few thousand dollars in my personal accounts. In the past few years it has been nearly impossible to work. My hope is not only to get well but regain a semblance of life that includes working  tithing and being healthy enough to spend quality time with my daughters and friends. I never thought I would get to this point but I don't see any options outside of reaching out for help. This is humbling. Thank you for reading my post and your generosity. I'm available to answer any questions anyone has. Sincerely  Gary 303-947-3537""",5265,14000,22,38,45,112,7
Janie&#x2019;s Cancer Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/janie-hannah,7,BIRMINGHAM,AL,Janie was diagnosed with triple positive Breast Cancer in June  2017.  Due to underlying chronic health issues she was not a good candidate for heavy dose chemotherapy and the surgeons she consulted did not want to attempt surgery unless she had undergone chemotherapy.From September  2017 through July of this year Janie pursued natural and non-toxic therapies from doctors in North Carolina to Atlanta to Sarasota  FL.  Unfortunately  though these therapies were like a full-time job for her  the primary tumor grew and metastasized to her liver.  With failure of the therapies and with the Catscan results in August  Janie knew it was time to consider one of the other options she had been given - treatment overseas.  A year ago she was referred to Clinics in Austria and Germany for their success rates treating cancers with lower dose chemotherapy in conjunction with Hyperthermia.Janie researched a number of clinics and doctors in Europe and Mexico  emailing quite a number of them.  She was most impressed with Dr. Alexander Herzog with Fachklinik in Bad Salzhausen  Germany.  He replied promptly to her inquiry with his straightforward opinion and preliminary treatment plan.  He is an Oncologist with a lengthy resume including heading his own clinic for over 20 years.  He is also a researcher  a medical school professor and has one of the most extensive experience histories in the various types of hyperthermia.Janie has been at his clinic since the first of September though mid-October.   She has had a very good response in just this period of time but needs three more rounds of therapy  at least two of those at the clinic in Germany between now and January.  The next two stays should only be 10-12 days in length so not nearly as costly as the expense she and Scott have incurred so far.  By the time this trip is paid for plus what they have spent in this past year  their total out of pocket will be around $100 000.Estimated cost for each of the next two stays is approximately $15 000  at least as far as what is known at this point.  We are trying to raise $50 000 for these next two trips and to cover some of unpaid bills of the first trip.  There will also be expenses in Birmingham and maintenance trips in the future.Would you please say a prayer for Janie  the healing of her body and the purpose God has for her in Germany?  She is giving the Great Physician the glory for the direction that He has given through this journey  the progress she is seeing  how well she has felt throughout these treatments so far  and the international friendships she is making.Thank you for your help!Alison and Skeet Edmonson,7655,50000,11,15,36,256,7

They still travel throughout the U.S. and to many Latin American countries sharing God’s Word and ministering in song. This recent diagnosis and Mom’s treatment plan will affect their ability to travel for a while  which will  consequently  put considerable financial strain on them.

We have set up this GoFundMe in hopes of raising enough funds to help with any medical costs not covered by insurance  and to offset lost income due to treatment and recovery.

(Because of their ministry  your donations are tax deductible.)While this has been a shock to our family  we are united in our love for our Mom and in our belief that God is in control.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any help you can give and for your prayers.,7096,8000,12,89,56,351,7
Helping Sam on the Road to Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-sam-on-the-road-to-recovery,9,Nepean,ON,"For those of you who know or those who have yet to find out; this fall my sister Samantha  lovingly referred to as Sam  suffered several small strokes while visiting and teaching in Rankin Inlet  Nunavut.  During each stroke  she went to the local health centre and was discharged after a few hours without a neurological follow-up. While a full neuro work-up is difficult in the north due to the lack of appropriate equipment  patients are flown out to Winnipeg to receive more intensive treatment. However  this did not occur.  By sheer force of will  Sam somehow made it to Ottawa where she suffered severely from the symptoms of her strokes and was immediately rushed to emergency. Once again she was discharged without the appropriate follow-up.  We went back to the emergency room for another visit and we weren't leaving without a CT scan. She was finally admitted and the CT scan showed that she had several small strokes within the last 3 weeks.  These strokes have paralyzed her right side  compromised her speech and presented Sam and our family with life-altering circumstances.  While there is a lot of hope for her recovery  Sam will need to undergo months  if not years  of intense physical rehabilitation.  Even though she is receiving the care she requires now  there will be a lot of expenses that are not covered by any plan. The treatment has yet to be fully laid out as Sam will require several other tests  but she will no doubt need to spend a significant amount of time at a rehabilitation facility. In the meantime our parents house will need to be retrofitted to accommodate the changes that Sam will need to assist in her recovery.  Sam is only 22 years old. She was about to move to Vancouver to pursue her dream and attend film school. She is smart  funny  kind  an avid boardgame player  and a bit of a weirdo  but that's what we love about her.  Please help Sam and our family by donating anything you can spare to help assist us with the expenses. Our family has an extremely long road ahead with some fairly big obstacles.  Any help and support you can provide in this time would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read through this and for making a donation. **Please note that there is a \tip\"" drop down bar when making a donation.

She needs all your prayers and your heartfelt financial support in any amount you are able to contribute.Gerri retired in 2015. In 2018  trying to make ends meet  Gerri took a job as a Health Caregiver.  She needed the money to cover her living expenses  as her income from Social Security just isn't enough and unfortunately  Gerri doesn't have a Pension.  She treated her patients as if they were her own family and made sure all her patients’ needs were taken care of.  She loved what she was doing  but when she learned of her condition  she had to resign her position.Gerri  in all her fights to overcome CANCER  is always the first to help someone in any way she can.  It could be by prayer  or for someone who needs to go somewhere and can't drive for one reason or another.  She helps her friends and neighbors in any way she can.  She prepares meals for people that she knows who need them just to be sure they are nourished.  She is always ready to help someone with a task or volunteer her time for a good cause.TreatmentNow CANCER THREE struck in September 2018.  Her Oncologist who treated her prior cancer told her that she must have chemotherapy and radiation simultaneously  then surgery six weeks later to remove portions of both the esophagus and the stomach.  She will be hospitalized for weeks.  There will also be many medications needed.Gerri is overwhelmed.  To say the least  it will be difficult for her to sustain this THIRD ROUND OF CANCER physically and financially.  GERRI’S FRIENDS ARE PLEADING FOR YOUR HELP.  Those of us who know and love Gerri for the wonderful person she is  know what a great friend she has been to all of us.  We will be so grateful for any help you can offer at this time! Please help our dear friend Gerri!  THANK YOU!,1455,25000,22,6,15,38,7

I am an outstanding athlete who practices mountain biking and soccer. I’ve also been an excellent student  and I love cooking. Actually  one of my biggest dreams is to be a  recognized chef. However  my current health issue is preventing me from doing all the activities that I  as a very young boy  love and dream to do.At the beginning of current year  2018  when I was doing my last year in High School  I was diagnosed with a malign tumor in my testicles. Right after this diagnosis  I got a surgery to remove the tumor and started a chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately  this treatment did not have the expected results  and now a new tumor in my stomach showed up. Besides that  a pair of ganglions started growing in my shoulders' area. The doctors in Venezuela do not have any other treatment they could recommend for my case  but I have a new opportunity at The Virgen de la Arrixaca Hospital  in Murcia  Spain  where I have to travel with my mother as soon as possible. There  I will start a new treatment that will hopefully help me recover my health and allow me continue my life as a normal young boy at my age.My family does not have sufficient funds to cover all the expenses regarding flight tickets  stay  food and medicines.  For this reason  I decided to create this fund raising so everyone who wishes to support my cause can donate through this platform. I truly appreciate your help. No matter the amount you may donate  your help means the life to me.

De hecho  uno de mis más grandes sueños es estudiar para convertirme en un chef de cocina reconocido. Sin embargo  mi actual problema de salud me está impidiendo realizar todas las actividades que yo  como cualquier otro joven  ama y sueña con hacer.A comienzos del presente año 2018  me dieron un terrible diagnóstico: un tumor maligno crecía rápidamente en mis testículos. A los pocos días  me operaron para remover el tumor en su totalidad  y luego comencé un tratamiento de quimioterapia para remover cualquier rastro de células malignas en mi cuerpo. Desafortunadamente  la quimioterapia no dio los resultados esperados  y lamentablemente un  nuevo tumor resistente a la quimioterapia apareció en mi zona abdominal y aún no para crecer. Además de esto  un par de ganglios también crecen en la zona de mis hombros. No existe ningún otro tratamiento que pueda ayudarme en mi país  pero tengo una nueva oportunidad en el Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca  en Murcia  España  país al que debo viajar con mi madre tan pronto como sea posible. Allí  comenzaré un nuevo tratamiento con la esperanza de recuperar mi salud y continuar mi vida como un joven normal a mi edad.Mi familia no cuenta con los fondos suficientes para cubrir los gastos referentes a tickets de avión  estadía  comida y medicinas. Por esta razón  hemos decidido comenzar una recaudación de fondos para que todos los que deseen apoyar mi causa  lo hagan a través de esta plataforma. Apreciamos muchísimo su ayuda.

Help Sinjun train a Service Dog,https://www.gofundme.com/help-sinjun-train-a-service-dog,3,HELENA,AL,￼￼Hi  my name is Sinjun Sinclair  and this is Boss (short for Big Boss). I will be training him to be my service dog.I created this page to raise money for his training and supplies to take care of him for a year.  At age 4 I was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a degenerative neuromuscular disease  caused by DNA mutation  which prevents cells from producing dystrophin  a vital protein used for muscle growth and regeneration. It rendered my muscles very weak and beyond repair. Over the years it has gotten progressively worse and worse. I became partially wheelchair bound at age 10  and fully bound at age 13  after I broke my leg from a fall. At 14 I was required to receive spinal fusion surgery  where a metal rod was fused to my spine. This was to treat my scoliosis caused by DMD. However  due to my back muscles being cut and lack of physical therapy  my upper body strength was dramatically reduced. Along with scoliosis  DMD resulted in osteoporosis  Vitamin-D deficiency  lung problems  increased risk of heart failure  anxiety  and depression.  Boss is a 8 month old Rottweiler and weighs about 71 lbs. He is very sweet and very intelligent. Someone is donating him to us from Texas. He is on his way and will arrive on October 13th. I need to have a service dog. It will help me be a lot more independent. Boss will be trained to do several tasks:  -Open Doors -Pick up and gather items (remotes  blankets  etc.) -Get and open drinks from fridge\n -Push buttons -Pick my arm up -Help lean me back -Get help when I'm in danger -Help with anxiety attacks The total cost for this service dog will be around $3 500. The training itself will cost $1 800. The rest of the donations will go towards caring for the dog for about a year. That money will cover:\n -Food\n -Getting fixed\n -Toys -Supplies (bowls  mats  bed  leash  vest  etc.)\n -Evaluation fee (for training) -Vet trips Any and all donations are greatly appreciated. Even if you are unable to donate  you can help by sharing with friends and family.  Any donations beyond the goal will be donated to the local Humane Society. A friend of mine  who is an artist  will be helping me with rewards for donation tiers. These rewards will be announced soon. Hola  mi nombre es Sinjun Sinclair  y este es mi perro Boss. Mi deseo es entrenar a Boss para que sea mi perro de asistencia. Quiero recaudar fondos para mandarlo entrenar y comprar las cosas necesarias para su mantenimiento por un año. A la edad de 4 años fui diagnosticado con una enfermedad que no deja que mis musculos se desarollen y crescan como deberian de crecer. La enfermedad ha ido empeorando con los años  y desde los 10 años he estado sentado en mi silla de ruedas. A la edad de los 14 años  tuve una cirugia en la espina dorsal y ahora tengo una barilla de metal en mi cuerpo. Ahora  los musculos de mi espalda fueron cortados y la fuerza en mi espalda es muy poca. Todo esto es por causa de mi enfermedad  la cual ha tambien causado que tenga problemas con mis pulmones  me da ansiedad y el riesgo de tener un ataque al corazón es muy alto. Boss es un perro de raza rottweiler y tiene 8 meses de edad. Su peso ya esta en las 71 libras. Es muy cariñoso y muy inteligente. Alguien en Texas me lo esta donando y llegara a mi casa el 13 de Octubre  2018. Necesito un perro de asistencia por causa de mi enfermedad. Tenerlo a el me va ayudar a ser mas independiente. Boss va ser entrenado en diferentes areas como por ejemplo: -Abrir puertas -Levantar cosas que yo no alcanze -Pasarme cosas del refrigerador y abrirlas por mi -Empujar -Levantar mi mano\n- Ayudarme a reclinarme - Ayudarme en caso que yo este en peligro -Ayudarme cuando tenga ansiedad - Y muchas otras cosas mas El total para que mi perro de asistencia sea entrenado es de $1 800 dolares. El resto de las donaciones las queremos usar para cuidar del perro por un año. Ese dinero cubrira cosas como: -comida -Juguetes - Tapete  cama  chaleco  collar  correa  etc -Visitas al veterinario  Les damos gracias por sus donaciones. Si usted no puede donar nada  ayudenos a compartir esta pagina con sus familiars y conocidos. Si sus donaciones sobrepasan la cantidad que pedimos  entonces lo donaremos nosotros a una organizacion que ayuda a perros abandonados. (Humane Society).  Un amigo que es artista nos estara ayudando a pintar unos regalos para aquellos que donen cantidades arriba de cierta cantidad. Ahorita no sabemos cual sera esa cantidad pero pronto lo anunciaremos. Gracias a todos por su tiempo y ayuda.,592,3500,9,17,13,108,6

Help Chance,https://www.gofundme.com/Help-Chance-Elliott,0,MOLINE,IL,The first 19 weeks and 6 days was an easy pregnancy for my Mommy...no nausea...no morning sickness...and all food tasted great. All ultrasounds showed a strong heartbeat and an active little me...once the doctor even called me a dancing gummy bear! So the ultrasound for the 20 week anatomy scan gave Mommy and Daddy nothing to worry about...Mommy actually went alone this time because a mixup the day before on the appointment already had Daddy off early. I  as always  was active...even yawned a time or two! My measurements were all just fine  then they checked on Mommy. Mommy’s check did not go so well. Mommy’s scan showed some concerns with her cervix and when her doctor examined her it showed that Mommy was dialated 1cm. Mommy was sent to the Downtown Houston hospital for a procedure to close her cervix and was told to plan for a week of bed rest...and this she did! Although  two days after the procedure Mommy's water broke...back to the hospital she went. A test confirmed it was the water that broke  not much fluid was showing up around me  but no one knew why this happened. The information from the doctors was all grim...basically Mommy and Daddy were told aborting was best  but the pregnancy could continue and with that choice more concerns were given than one could count. Mommy and Daddy didn’t need time to think this over...Mommy and I were both healthy...the pregnancy would continue and things would be taken day by day. The next 3 days were spent at the hospital with antibiotics for Mommy then she was sent home with strict bed rest orders. Weekly doctor visits were Mommy’s only day out of bed. The goal was to get to October 9th...24 weeks...Two days short of this goal Mommy had some concerns and headed to the hospital again...she was admitted  examined  and told everything was fine  but she would be staying at the hospital...kinda like moving in...until I arrive. Mommy is in Downtown Houston at the hospital and Daddy is home so he can take care of my 3 big brothers and go to work. This is our family’s current situation and will be until I make my grand appearance. Mommy has had steroid injections to help strengthen my lungs and my heartbeat is monitored twice daily. The doctors are ready for arrival at any time...but no one knows exactly when that will be though...NICU has already talked to Mommy and Daddy about what my stay there could be like. Mommy and Daddy are a strong team ...but your support will help releafe some stress I know they are feeling.,975,10000,4,10,13,309,6
Fukushima Survivor and  Chronic Lyme Warrior,https://www.gofundme.com/florida-lyme,0,TALLAHASSEE,FL,At the end of March 2018   I went hiking off the trails to the hidden sinkholes in Florida  with my boyfriend. Before I knew it I was covered by 15 ticks. Unfortunately they were nymphs and I didn’t recognize all of them and until a couple of days later. Flu like symptoms hit me about a week later. Raging fever  nausea  vomiting  extreme joint pain  fatigue  myalgia  mental confusion and the list goes on. I thought I had the Flu. After visiting the first doctor  she refused to put me on antibiotics even though I told her the story on how I was covered in ticks. Instead she sent me for an emergency ultrasound on my abdomnen that was $400.00 and refusedto give me the standard blood work to test for any tick borne illnesses.I didn’t find a doctor who would start me on antibiotics until three weeks later.  They only tested me for Erhlichosis and the Elisa for the Lyme test instead of the standard western blot test. One negative erhlichosis test and two negative (Elisa) Lyme tests later  my doctors began to treat me like I’m crazy. Of course this is after raking up my medical expenses by almost 9 000 after just two visits. Not only did I have to battle this violent disease alone  I was accused of being a drug addict by my employer. One of my former supervisors showed up at my house during my approved sick leave and accused me of being a drug addict after months of having to endure a hostile work environment I was forced to resign in early July.Current StatusUnfortunately  during the time I became ill  my mother claimed to have no revolution of the exreme abuse I suffered as a child. I do not have a stable family member in my life at this moment and could really use your support.  I’ve lost my career  my family  my friends  my security  my savings  and almost my sanity through out this entire process.  But I refuse to give up. After eight months of excruciating pain  I have begun alternative therapy. I haven’t seen much improvement yet but I’m damn determined to get back to Nature! If you have any questions  concerns or are looking for a new friend please don’t hesitate to contact me❤️ Please share or donate if you can. Thank you so muchCurrent Symptoms: I am beginning  to have extreme light sensitivity in my eyes  that is mainly effecting my right eye. My knees are still swelling and feel like they’re being stabbed with shooting pains all down my legs.My shoulders ache so bad  deep in their sockets and bones and my fever continues to spike through out the day.I fall over all now all of the time and I’m in tears every time I have to move.HopeThe instilled stubbornness continues to push me to go outside everyday. Whether it’s for five minutes or five hours  I push myself to continue to do the things I have always enjoyed. I refuse to let this disease ruin my dream of working one day as a nature conservationist. Never give up and I hope you find your inner stubbornness to keep fighting too. Thank you so much for your time!,825,10000,7,8,9,120,7

Help Tammy Franke Beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-tammy-franke-beat-cancer,9,RENO,NV,Hello  my name is Tammy Franke and I have been dealing with a rare form of cancer called leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava for 14 years. I have had several metastasis  (liver  both lungs  liver again  pancreas  kidney  skin and colon) I have tried all conventional treatments but unfortunately we are down to more drastic measures. There is a doctor in Santa Monica named Dr. Chawla that deals with the more difficult cases and more cutting edge treatment. I went to see him this week and he has a treatment that he feels confident about. Unfortunately it has to be done in Santa Monica every 3 weeks. The costs would entail air fare  gas  if we drive  hotels  food  rental car  medical expenses  etc. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. God has blessed me from the beginning and He continues to carry me and my family through this journey. Thank you all in advance.,9150,10000,12,92,93,613,7

#MieMieStrong,https://www.gofundme.com/wukq3w-miemiestrong,9,LAVERGNE,TN,To know Mijha is to love her:MieMie was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. She is currently undergoing more test and will start chemotherapy soon. How it began: Summer of 2018  MieMie started to experience cold/sinus like symptoms. She went to the doctor and was given medicine to treat a sinus infection. After several trips to the hospital  Mijha was diagnosed with pneumonia. The symptoms never went away  and on September 11  Mijha went back to the doctor and was referred to see a pulmonologist on September 13  2018. The day of her appointment  Mijha started to experience chest pains  her husband urged her to go to the hospital. Once she arrived  the doctors did a CT scan and noticed a 7 1/2 cm mass on her lungs. The next day  prior to being discharged Mijha started to experience migraines. The doctors performed a MRI and noticed 3 lesions on her brain. Mijha recently saw a radiation oncologist  who recommended radiosurgery to target the spots on her brain. We thank God that they were so small that radiation isn’t necessary on her brain. We are raising money to help Mijha  Marcus and their six kids. Mijha is not working as much and her ability to work a full schedule will continue to decrease as she starts treatment. The money will be used to assist with bills  food  and providing basic necessities for their children. Mijha will give the clothes off her back to anyone in need  Let’s all get together and shower her with prayers and assistance.

Keep Shantina Smiling!,https://www.gofundme.com/keep-shantina-smiling,9,Gibsons,BC,Keep Shantina Smiling!We all love her smile… you just can’t help but smile back when you see it! It’s Shantina Rose MacArthur’s wonderful and amazing magic that softens our hearts  reminds us to celebrate differences and teaches us acceptance and generosity. There’s no scale to measure the actions she has inspired in others. Her magic is the value she adds to the lives of all of those lucky enough to know her. This is her story...Shantina was born in January  2007 with Down’s Syndrome and a congenital heart defect. She required surgery at just 4 months of age for a AVSD repair. At 4 years of age  Shantina required another surgery to remove excessive scar tissue that built up in her heart and interfered with normal heart function. Unfortunately  her rapid growth has now put extra stress on her heart and on October 10th she will have her 3rd surgery before her 12th birthday.  There’s also the great possibility that Shantina will need a mechanical valve which would require her to take Warfarin medication for the rest of her life. Her doctors expect that her recovery will take at least 6 weeks but  with all these uncertainties  her Super Mom  Louise Parent  desperately needs our support. Louise is a hardworking single parent who also works full-time as an Education Assistant with B.C. School District #46 (Sunshine Coast). She is not only incredibly dedicated to the care and needs of her own children  but to all of the children in our community. Louise has had to take a leave from work to focus on Shantina’s care in Vancouver  while she is in B.C. Children’s Hospital and also during her ongoing  recovery at home in Gibsons. Your support is urgently needed and would be greatly appreciated in assisting Louise with loss of income  her stay in Vancouver (pre and post-op)  ferry  other travel expenses  food  medication  home support  and most importantly  maintaining their mortgage payments and household bills to relieve any and all fears of losing their home during what is already a very stressful time in both their lives.B.C. Children’s Hospital regularly performs miracles and has saved Shantina’s life before  for this we are eternally grateful  but nothing compares to the power of a mother’s love and devotion. No one is more deserving of our help than Shantina and Louise. Please share their story and help if you can.Thank you for your love and prayers and we are so very grateful of any contributions to this amazing heart family! May every soul  regardless of ability  shine bright!              ❤️ We love you Shantina!❤️,4690,10000,19,47,57,185,7

Getting Back On My Feet,https://www.gofundme.com/67zfh14,5,AUSTIN,TX,Originally I was in a car crash. I broke my hip and for a short period of time  I actually died. After having my right hip put back together it wasn’t until weeks later that my doctors realized that I had a build up of fluid in my left thigh that went up into my hip and around to my back. Sadly this fluids became infected and extended my time in the hospital. The crash was on June 30th and as I’m writing this it’s October 5th  since I’ve had countless surgeries and have just recently been allowed to walk again. As you must already know I’ve fallen behind on bills and the upcoming hospital bills will be ridiculous. If you are able to help me out in my journey to recovery it would be greatly appreciated and much thanks to you.\n-DeVante,840,5000,18,17,11,39,7
Baby Levi,https://www.gofundme.com/ezry8s-baby-levi,9,THERESA,WI,My name is Kelly LeGreve and I am lucky enough to be the teacher of Brooklyn  Levi’s 4 year-old sister.  Please take a few minutes to read the following about Levi  written by his mother.  He’s is fighting for his life and we can all help make life a little easier for this family. Thank you for taking time to read their story and consider giving anything you can. When I was 23 weeks pregnant we got Levi's diagnosis of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome or HLHS. This meant his left side of his heart  specifically his left ventricle did not develop properly. This is one of the most severe heart defects because the left ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to the body. Normal oxygen saturations are 98-100% but Levi is only at 78% right now  which is noticeable through his blue lips  finger  toes  cheeks  and nose. From 23 weeks on I had weekly appointments  sometimes up to 3 different appointments a week. This was very costly and required me to take off of work frequently.We had a scheduled c-section at 39 weeks so that we could ensure Levi was born at Children's Hospital in the very best care. Levi got placed on my chest for about 10 seconds and then taken right to the NICU. I had some complications and could not get down to see him for 24 hours. Even then  I only got to hold him for 20 minutes  Dan not at all  and then he went to the CICU. Since he had a breathing tube we could not hold him at all and at 5 days old he went for his first open heart surgery. At about 2 weeks old he was finally recovered enough that we were able to hold him. However  he had several complications and we had to stay in the hospital until his second open heart surgery and finally made it home after 4 months in the hospital. Things were going well until he was 9 months old and stopped breathing one day. I had to perform CPR until the paramedics arrived and Levi was flighted to Children's. For about an hour I did not know if my child was alive or not  and even then if he would be ok. Levi recovered  but he had a stroke and we were in the hospital for a week and a half. Since then  levi had been doing fairly well  but he is now in heart failure and requires oxygen 24/7. Due to his condition he is also 100% g-tube dependant and gets fed every 4 hours during the day and continuously overnight. He also has a medicine schedule and I had to give him lovenox injections twice a day for several months. Because of his needs I have not been able to return to work since he was born. We are now in the hospital to put him on the transplant list and will more than likely be here until he gets a heart. We also have 3 other children  ages 14  7  and 5.Despite all he has been through  I have people constantly asking if Levi is always so happy  and he is. He brings joy to everyone who meets him with his infectious smile and bright blue eyes. We are beyond thankful to all of the people Levi has touched who have offered so much to our family.Levi checking into the hospital. Brooklyn and Levi,2540,5000,9,51,31,274,7

He currently lives in Taos  New Mexico and has to travel to Albuquerque  New Mexico (which is a little over 2 hours) several times a week for treatment.  Being that he is unable to work and is the sole provider for his family  this diagnosis is not only affecting his physical health but also his financial state.

Transportation To Dialysis,https://www.gofundme.com/gad5y-transportation-to-dialysis,5,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,On August 15th  2018 my beautiful daughter Stacey was rushed to the ER thinking she had a bad case of the flu. They determined she had a very serious case of sepsis  her liver and kidneys were shutting down. This particular hospital thought it was best to transfer her to a hospital that had a liver specialist on call.  She was placed in ICU for almost 2 weeks and was told she had 7 months to live as her liver was not functioning and her kidneys were shutting down so she would have to immediately be put on continual dialysis.  During this time the hospital and Dr's were doing what they could to save her life and she was not responding to dialysis very well because her blood pressure would plummet and we almost lost her twice. Stacey was so ill she received her last rights and all we could do is wait and hope that she would be able to tolerate dialysis a little better and get stronger. Maybe eventually she could have a liver/kidney transplant. The Dr's were not giving us much hope.  They were able to get the sepsis under control and things began to look up a little and she was moved to a progressive unit where they manage end of life issues and try to make the patient as comfortable as possible and talked to us about hospice.  But that didn't happen as Stacey began to get stronger against all odds.  As it is now she has progressed enough that she'll be able to leave the hospital and go to medical rehab facility to get stronger and eventually be able to leave and come home and live with me. That's where we have a problem. She's going to need transportation every other day and I do not have a car so I need to buy one. Also if she's able to have a transplant there will be numerous Dr appointments she'll need to go to.  I am her mother and the absolute only person who will be able to make sure she can get there. Everyone else is either working or just for whatever reason aren't available to be her transportation.  I'm not employed so I have all the time she needs.I had a stroke in 2009 and have been disabled ever since and can not work.  Before I had the stroke I had been working for Anthem and had a pretty decent income and car. After the stroke everything changed of course and money was and is tight.  With the back pay from disability I was able to buy a nicer car knowing it would be the last car I would own.  The reason I do not have a car at all is going to make a couple of people uncomfortable but it's the truth and they can't deny they're responsible.  I was letting my other daughter drive my nicer car on occasion not knowing she had a drug problem.  To make a long story short she wrecked my car and it was undrivable. I only had liability insurance and my car went to a friends junkyard. That car is now repaired but I can't afford to pay for what it took to repair it. But I still had my old car. Until my brother in law asked to use it not telling me he didn't have a drivers license. He got pulled over  car impounded and he didn't have the money to get it out and because I'm only paid once a month I couldn't afford to either. By the time I got paid again the fines were more than the car was worth.  So no car at all now. I've been getting around by bus  walking etc.  which has been fine with me since I realize now I shouldn't have been nice enough to let anyone use my car in the first place. I have to be able to help her. I can't afford car payments so I'll have to get something that will get us back and forth to dialysis.  I'm in absolute panic mode about not being able to do this for her and this is my only recourse if this doesn't work out I'm at a loss.I hate to be asking for handouts but at this point I can't let my pride get in the way and I honestly don't know any other way. Thank you.,375,2000,16,19,5,23,7

Support for Brittany Sass,https://www.gofundme.com/brittany-sass,9,SYRACUSE,NY,Hello Everyone! This is Brittany and at the young age of 27 she had a heart attack and a stroke. Brittany had been taken out of work for two weeks prior to finding out she had a heart attack and stroke. She had been taken out for Pneumonia. She started to feel dizzy and was not getting any better and went to the emergency room. From there they had determined Brittany had a stroke that was caused by her having a heart attack.She was rushed into three surgeries  two of which were very risky and we are lucky for such an amazing team at Upstate to pull her through. First she underwent the process of taking the pressure off her brain. Once the pressure from her brain was released it opened the blocked valve in her heart  causing the blood clots that were there to release to her legs. She was rushed into open heart surgery where they were able to pull most of the clotting and repair the damage to her heart. After the open heart surgery she then had to have the clots removed from her legs. The chance she could loose a leg  both legs or her feet still loomed in the unknown. Brittany made it out of all surgeries alive and in a lot of pain. She has made amazing progress for having gone through what she did. She can talk but she does not have mobility yet. She is looking at a 2-3 week stay at upstate where they will continue to monitor her. After that she will need rehabilitation. This is not a short fix and her being out of work puts her mother in very hard times.To try and speak to Brittany's character will not do it justice but I will try.Brittany has an endless love for animals  her princess being Chloe but she treats them all with love and caring. Her favorite times are watching the baby red pandas grow up at work. Brittany baby sits her friends son  and often you have to fight to give her money  she does it because she wants to spend time with him and she is his best friend. Brittany is always putting everyone's wants and needs before her own  often times I don't think she even realizes she does. She is a wallflower that feels like she goes unnoticed  but her absence in the zoo she works at is profound and noticeable. I am lucky to know such a selfless and genuine person.Brittany is loved by her employees  her family and her friends. At this time Brittany lives with her mom and together they pay their bills for the household. Currently Brittanys' uncle who is fighting cancer lives with them as well. This has not been an easy year and with Brittany out of work the loss is taking a toll on the family. I would like to be able to raise money to help with whatever medical bills are not covered and to help cover the household bills so neither Brittany or her Mother have to worry what is going to happen.I appreciate any help that will keep this family afloat in their tough times. Linda is working as much as she can but Brittany's care takes up a lot of Linda's time. I know Brittany would never ask for help and that is all the more reason she needs it most.,2023,5000,9,40,33,309,6

After a biopsy through a craniotomy  he was diagnosed with an aggressive Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma. According to the neurosurgeon in Des Moines  it is inoperable. They are currently waiting for a second opinion from the Mayo Clinic. They have a fight ahead of them; one that their love will guide them through. They are newlyweds  married just 4 months. They recently purchased a house. Please take a moment to show them your love and support through this initiative.  They are young. They are in love.  They are starting their life together.  They are up against a battle few of us can imagine.   Please consider a donation.Update: After spending several days at the Mayo Clinic  Michael found his best option was to start treatment with his doctors in Des Moines. He just finished 6 weeks of harsh radiation  alongside Temodar  which is Chemotherapy in pill form. He meets again with his oncologist on January 29th  to start a second round of Temodar. He will continue this treatment for 6 weeks  which will be followed by an MRI to see how well his tumor is responding to the treatment. His doctors are trying to get his insurance to approve Optune Therapy  which at the moment is being denied. Please consider a donation  because he still has a fight ahead of him. ThankYou!,5940,25000,8,24,91,1000,7

She just finished a round of chemotherapy and did another MRI to get ready for surgery. Due to events with her children and side effects of her treatment  she has already used her paid sick days for the year.  She is planning on having a double mastectomy this month and the doctor is suggesting a 4 week recovery period. I would like to raise enough money so that she can take those four weeks off of work and not worry about trying to go back sooner since it will be unpaid. Any little bit helps.

Her fight is our fight,https://www.gofundme.com/m8bza5-her-fight-is-our-fight,1,Toowoomba,NZ,"HER FIGHT IS OUR FIGHT.  On the 26th of July Leticia at the young age of 33 yrs recieved the news no one wants to hear  her biopsy results were in and it was breast cancer. Over the next few days and several more tests it was diagnosed as Stage 3 Triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma.  It had moved from the breast to the lymph nodes.  Surgery was discussed  then more results came in with more cancer being found on the 30th of July. Surgery was decided and a mastectomy scheduled for the 1st of August. Then a sudden change from the surgeon and the oncologist.  Immediate surgery to install a Port a Cath on the 31st of July with Chemotherapy to be the first line of treatment instead of a mastectomy. Chemo  started the following week on the 7th of August. When asked why the sudden change in the treatment plan the oncologist said we can't afford to wait the four weeks it would take to recover from surgery to start chemotherapy due to the further cancer located.  Absolutely devastating news.  This young fit healthy  wife  mother of two  daughter  daughter in law  sister in law  cousin   friend to many and amazing beautiful person went from having a normal life to the fight of her life in a matter of days.  Her only concern  being here for her children (Makenzie 6  Braxton 3) and not leaving them.  \It's not fair on them they are so young  they won't understand.\""  Not once has she said why me  I'm too young  etc etc.  not worried for herself  only her family.Always positive  always happy  always strong for her kids and her family.  No other option then beat this.  No complaints  no questions  just \""it is what it is.\""￼Leticia in unable to work due to weekly chemotherapy treatment  treatment to be about five months followed by surgery  followed by radiation treatment with no guarantee.  There is currently no other treatment available for triple negative cancer. Her husband has taken as much time off as he can using carers leave and rec leave to look after her and their two young children but is now back at work.  Leticia is receiving treatment and is doing as much as she physically can to lessen the impact on her children.  She is very fatigued but still no complaints.Obviously this time is extremely emotional  stressful and financialy draining with mounting medical bills along with loss of income.  I know they have some great friends and family helping with the kids  sitting with Leticia during treatment and offering support.  On on top of this in November 2017 Leticia's husband  my son  was diagnosed with Stage 2 Kidney cancer resulting in a left radical nephrectomy ( kidney removed).  He required extended time off work and is continuing follow up treatment. Both parents with a cancer diagnosis within 8 months is unbelievable !!

Chris + Lyme Mexico = Hope,https://www.gofundme.com/chris-lyme-mexico,0,CINCINNATI,OH,As many of you know  Chris has struggled for the last decade of his life. Between ages 24 and 34  most young men are busy establishing careers  enjoying life  and starting families. Instead  he has been fighting  a mysterious and confusing illness eventually diagnosed as late-stage Lyme Disease.He hasn’t had one second without pain in the last seven years. On a typical day  Chris is confronted with a long list of debilitating issues that he doesn’t understand. His gut doesn’t work. His brain doesn’t work like it used to. He’s constantly complaining of feeling like his spine and head are on fire or that there’s a knife in his back. To make things worse  he can’t sleep well if at all. All these things combined create an incredibly heavy emotional burden that leaves him feeling isolated and disconnected from life.Chris has not been able to work since December of 2016. He has applied for disability  but was denied. He has spent a small fortune on this disease  but he’s at the end of his financial capabilities. His medical treatments  testing  and supplements are incredibly expensive because most are not covered by insurance.While Chris continues to seek help in many places  his main physician is an MD based in Indianapolis who has been working hard for the past two years to help get him well. Many of his treatment protocols  if they help  have only helped for short periods of time. This has led to many conversations over the past several months entertaining treatments not available here in the States. Of the many options  a place simply called Lyme Mexico has risen to the top. Chris had a consult with the doctor at the center last week and was given a suggested treatment plan. The plan is approximately $16 600 to $21 000+. This does not include airfare to Mexico ($500?)  accommodations for his 5-6 weeks stay ($3 200)  food  etc. The total estimate may be around $25 000. It’s my understanding that he may not feel significantly better for about five months after  so he will still have follow-up treatments and supplements back home before he will (hopefully) be able to work again. We are asking for an additional $5 000 to get him through those months as well.Could you help us raise $30 000 to get him through this treatment? Healing is not certain  but we need to give him the chance to try. Things are rolling quickly. He may begin treatment in early November (if not  then in January  2019). We are asking for donations by October 31st. If you can donate sooner  that will be helpful as there are hold deposits to be made shortly.If you wish to send money to him by mail  he is currently living with his grandparents in Cincinnati. You can contact him directly for that address if you would like. Feel free to follow up with Chris for more specific details regarding his medical journey as well.Would you please also pray for Chris? He is incredibly discouraged. Since we have known him (Becca since 2011  and Susan since earlier in 2018)  we have seen a significant decline in him. If you pass him in the store  he may give you a slight smile and say he’s doing okay. He is not. He feels like he is dying  but how do you say that in passing at Walmart? Most of his days involve many  many tears. It is not uncommon to find him with his face buried in a couch or bed  unable to function at all because his pain is too great. We see panic come across him when he begins shaking his legs and reaching for some herbs just for the hope that it might take the edge off his pain. (Pain killers don’t even help.) He often just cries out “help.” Help from those around him  and help from the Father. It’s misery.This season is incredibly dark and painful. Would you consider checking in on him occasionally? It’s a very lonely road he is walking  and he loves hearing from you. Please pray God uses this treatment to get him better so he can truly live again.In spite of seeing a smile on his face when seeing him in public  this is what many of his private moments are like.￼￼Please visit the below for more information about the Lyme Mexico clinic. www.lymemexico.comThank you so much for caring for our friend.,42075,48000,14,88,156,863,7
Inspire Darrell&#x2019;s Every Breath,https://www.gofundme.com/inspire-darrell-to-enjoy-breathing,9,Winnipeg,MB,This fundraising page has been set up to help reduce some of the financial burdens/struggles facing Darrell Adamik and his wife Brenda… he is a gentle  kind  loving and dear Husband  Father  Grandpapa  Son  Brother  Uncle  and Friend…Three years ago he was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis  a scaring of the lungs.  As he is a non-smoker  it is believed years of working in a chemical environment may have contributed to his condition. He requires a bi-lateral lung transplant. When his lungs worsened he was placed on an On-call wait list. This surgery would require them travelling and temporarily residing in Edmonton  Alberta. In preparing for the bi-lateral lung transplant  he was then diagnosed with stomach Cancer.  Thus the lung surgery was postponed. Numerous Chemo treatments then followed and eventually he had to have his esophagus/stomach removed. While the surgery removed all the cancer  his recovery journey continues to challenge this couple. There are breathing challenges (Now requiring full time oxygen) Eating challenges (Which includes some feeding by tube)  Mobility challenges (Due to severe shortness of breath and requiring specialized equipment)  Everyday normal home and maintenance challenges (Who can do it?)Financial  challenges (Brenda has been his primary care provider and as such work outside of the home has been minimal)Added travel costs (As they reside out of town there are added travel costs to numerous medical appointments). While the journey has been arduous  Darrell remains hopeful to have the much needed lung transplant.  While to some my goal may appear ambitious any contributions you could provide our brother would be greatly appreciated. Funds raised will offset the financial stresses of additional medical equipment and transportation needs…. Sincerely Val Adamik …,6195,40000,20,15,21,66,6

Team Diane Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/team-diane-cancer-fund,1,SALIX,IA,Diane was diagnosed with Stage 4 Uterine Cancer in early September. She chose to fight and did her first Chemo therapy at the Buffett Cancer Center in Omaha on September 18th.  She had some complications with fluid from her first chemo treatments at the time that caused her to have a short stay in the hospital in Omaha at that time. She came home  and was fighting nausea and vomiting from the chemo (or so we thought)  until on Wednesday September 26th. We rushed her to the ER in Sioux City  where after running some labs we found that the majority of her organ functions were not working well at all.  She was transported to Nebraska Medicine Buffett Cancer Center in Omaha where they began tests to find out why she was having so many issues. During the course of that time her vitals began to drop drastically  she went into kidney failure  and her heart could no longer maintain functioning on its own. We had to make the decision to put her on life support in order to help her fight.  She was moved to the ICU where she has remained  and continues to remain as of 10/5/18. Unbeknownst to the doctors and us when she first arrived in Omaha her white blood count had dropped to nothing  and she had no ability to fight off the most basic of bugs. She had contracted E. Coli and it was running rampant throughout her system.  We thought we would lose Diane last week but she has continued to fight for each and every day. Needless to say  in order to be there to support her and comfort her during her time in the ICU it has taken a toll on the family finances. We are asking for donations to help Diane's husband remain near her while she fights with all her might to get healthy enough to come back home.,3160,10000,9,32,46,394,7
Reduce Roadway Fatalities,https://www.gofundme.com/reduce-roadway-fatalities,7,HERMITAGE,TN,"Letter from a recent supporter: \In Tennessee  they practically give DL’s away. I found this out when I took a young man to get his [test] in Sumner Co. I’d given him a few months of driving lessons in my then wife’s car. I hoped he was ready. After  I approached him concerned he’d been flunked. When I ask him what has happened he told me the test was a short drive up to the highway and back. I couldn’t believe it. I’d paid for driving school when I was getting my license up in Kansas City and I’d never been in an accident that I had caused. I’ll definitely read it and pass it on.\""  Note: The above testimonial is unsolicited but does reflect a common situation with many U.S. states especially in the southern ones  that being inadequate road tests for licensing.The 2019  2nd Edition of The Careless Driver covering the DUI Driver and innovative remedies for that type driver is published on Amazon.com Kindle and now soft cover. The driver that texts and drives is also in it.  Hundreds of copies are in the hands of lawmakers in several southern states.  This was the initial target set in October 2018.Our goal and target now is to introduce legislative bills that each State  starting with Tennessee can pass. The nature of each based on the recommendations in The Careless Driver book  is aimed at establishing statues which 1) require comprehensive road tests to ensure newly licensed drivers have demonstrated the skills necessary to avoid collisions with pedestrians  animals and other vehicles no matter what the conditions.  2) Those drivers who are involved in a collision where a person or persons have been injured or killed do not pay a heavy fine and go to traffic school to be lectured verbally.  The judge is mandated to send the person to Driving Academy Training. for complete remedial handling  despite any protest  justification or alibi the student may present to the instructor.  They  do not pass until they can do correctly and understand why it is the correct procedure that they failed to perform. As stated in the book's Preface  \""We as a nation have  sunk into complacency about vehicle death and homicide on our roadways  while many states require little in the way of driving skills to obtain a driver’s license.\"" Ourcampaign reverses this complacency through skillful use of legislation enacted and designed to put more 'competent' drivers  both mentally and skill-wise on our U.S. roads.  That's the goal.  I am committed to seeing this through to complete success.   And Consider this:  one in four drivers in their lifetime will have a collision  some fatal.  And  that is the rate now.  If nothing but citations are given out for traffic violations  and few if any violators are instructed properly / professionally to practice the correct way to drive that they failed to perform  there is no hope that in a few years the rate will be 30% to 40% of drivers will be involved in a vehicle collision with proportionate increase of deaths. *Now all donations go to funding letterhead  postage  business cards for volunteers  and much needed fees to keep the campaign website up and renewing every week with campaign progress data and wins. Alternatively it takes only $12 to get the ball rolling with your legislature with 2 copies of the 2nd Edition. Calls also can be  made  to lawmakers by volunteers as well as personal visits such as I have done recently.  We can introduce a bill this year and get to vote if we act now. Or have the two copies of THE CARELESS DRIVER Edition #2    one each delivered to a your district lawmaker  one for your district State  Senator and one for your State Assemblyman.  Contact information for each of the southern states is provided below.Either way  contributors receive a copy (PDF) of the latest  updated edition  and further expanded editions  as well as the most current NHSTA data along with campaign updates. Lists (see link below) of state legislators exist now with email  telephone  fax number for contact  and postal address plus the traffic associated committees they serve on   with more created weekly.  Help is needed for this administrative task as well. Follow-up calls to make sure your senator has their copy also needed.  Instructions are provided.Starting with the State Senate legislator's lists since they are the leaders that enact state laws. we target the first states that historically have drivers with the worst records (circa 2018) and skimpy license road tests.  We realize that we can not deter or escape all possible deaths from collisions  since there are also common causes of crashes  i.e. blow-outs from defective tires  roll-overs  etc.  but we can reduce the number of drivers who are careless drivers or distracted and /or impaired drivers by instruction at their expense when they violate traffic laws and good sense.   There are many groups doing seminars and trying to do something about these mounting unnecessary fatalities  but without also putting more attention on skills for driving we as a nation will still fall far short of the goal.Our campaign motto is: \""No more careless driver fatalities.\""We now have six full rosters of State senators  names  shipping addresses  email addresses  tel/fax #  and committees served on.Lend a hand  participate in a life saving  life changing activity  and rest at night more peacefully as we move toward the end goal as embodied in our campaign motto. And  also experience the joy and pleasure again of driving without nervous attention on the mother drivers' *The Federal Government has granted us recognition (but not 'formal recognition') as a 501 (c) 4 organization (Social Betterment).  This requires $600.00 paid to get a letter of formal recognition.

Matt Ramsay Road to Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/matt-ramsay-road-to-recovery,5,Brampton,ON,Matthew Ramsay – Road to Recovery On Tuesday October 2nd2018  we received several nervous text messages from our very good friend Stacey. She was worried about her husband Matt  who was over two hours late arriving home from work and not responding to phone calls or text messages. We know that this is very uncharacteristic of Matt but tried to offer reassuring words and comfort  like “maybe he lost his phone” or was “stuck in some really bad traffic”. A few hours later Stacey received a phone call from the police that we all hope we never get in our lifetime. Matt had been in a serious car accident  the consequences of which we are learning will have a profound impact on all of their lives. Matt is bed-ridden  sedated  and heavily medicated for pain management. He has sustained serious injuries including broken ribs and ankle  reconstruction of his diaphragm  a collapsed long  a fractured pelvis  and countless stitches and staples. He has already endured two surgeries (including a splenectomy) and a blood transfusion and will require intensive rehabilitation to retain mobility and full function of his organs and limbs. If you are fortunate enough to know Matt  you know he would give you the shirt off his back if he thought you needed it. He is a kind  generous  and loving person. His wife and children are his entire world  and the titles of Husband and Dad are ones he wears proudly. He would be heartbroken if he thought the injuries he sustained in this accident put any burden  financial or otherwise  on his family in any way.We know that many people have been inquiring about how they can help  or what they can do or provide for Stacey and their children during this time. In an effort to maintain normalcy in their lives and to eliminate the burden of the financial strain that they will inevitably have to work through  as Matt will be unable to work  we are creating this page to give you the option to donate and/or share this page with others who may be looking to help. The monies collected will help to subsidize the costs of being at a hospital far away from home (hotels  gas  parking  food  etc.) and any costs associated with rehabilitation that are not covered by insurance plans over the next few weeks and months.  Both Matthew and Stacey’s families would like to thank everyone in advance for your thoughts  prayers  positive vibes  phone calls and text messages.

Jennifer&apos;s Memorial Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/jennifer039s-cancer-support-fund,1,BOONEVILLE,MS,Jennifer Friar Groves was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. She had a mastectomy on her left breast and is currently going through stage four terminal metastatic breast cancer. Over the course of her treatment  she's had multiple scans  x rays  surgeries  chemo treatments  radiation treatments  hospital admissions and E.R visits. Ever since her diagnosis  she's was a fighter. Through all the treatments and hospital visits  she never lost her faith or gave up hope. She held on strong and fought every day with much determination. Our hearts are very heavy to say that December 3  2018 our beloved and beautiful Jennifer passed away. Though her battle was long  she never gave up. She is forever loved and cherished. Even after her passing  Jennifer was so determined to help others that she made the brave and selfless decision to continue to help others suffering with cancer by donating herself to scientific medical research.We are so proud of her for being willing to aid in the study of cancer research that will hopefully lead to better treatment options for those suffering from this disease. Medicaid only covered so much and there isn't much the family can do alone financially. There are some costs that were left behind as well as the cost for memorial service.That's where you come in. There is always strength in numbers and with multiple people helping this will ensure that Jennifer is taken care of. No amount is too small. Give whatever you can. Feel free to share this story with as many people as possible to help reach the goal faster. Thank you so much.,3046,6700,16,45,66,275,5

Care for Calliope,https://www.gofundme.com/careforcalliope,0,NEWYORK,NY,"I started this fundraiser to help my dear friends whom I have known since college  Ariana and Pat  and their daughter Calliope. Each beaming smile of Calliope's on this page is a testament to her remarkable parents  and to her own resilience. Their journey as a family has been incredibly challenging  but despite the physical and emotional toll of so many setbacks  so much uncertainty  and a quagmire of medical and institutional bureaucracies  Calliope is thriving and growing.As a friend who loves them  I have often felt at a loss for how to help  beyond just bearing witness to their struggles and triumphs  and providing the occasional dumpling delivery during one of their lengthy hospital stays. Anyone who spends a brief visit with this family will witness the love and hard work that Ari and Pat devote daily to helping Calliope live her very best life. One way I know we can help is by giving them some much needed financial support to enable them to continue to do exactly that.Please take a few minutes to read Ari’s message below about how you can help. All donations will go directly to Ari and Pat's account. Your support of any amount is valuable and will be greatly appreciated  as will your help in spreading the word by sharing this campaign! Thank you. - Jennifer------------- The following is from Ariana  Calliope's Mom ----------------Meet Calliope.Officially  she doesn’t walk or talk or do anything without assistance  but in the real world beyond bureaucratic descriptions  she’s an impish six-year old who loves horseback riding  dancing  lasagna  and putting one over on her grandfather.When Calliope was born here in NYC  she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Sturge Weber Syndrome. My husband (and college sweetheart) Pat  and I  looked at each other with a lot of fear in those first few days  and our lives have been characterized by fear and uncertainty since then. But there’s so much more. Calliope has been our guide in all things compassion  grit  and joy-related. She has shown us what resilience means  what being a fighter means  and what it means to find grace in the smallest moments.Sturge Weber Syndrome happens following a genetic mutation of the GNAQ gene in utero and results in vascular malformations  which in Calliope’s case impacted both sides of her brain. We were told when she was an infant that there was no knowing what she might or might not be able to do. When we asked a neurosurgeon who was  monitoring her for hydrocephalus when she was around 18 months if she would ever walk  he looked at us very kindly and told us it wasn’t out of the question. We didn’t trust his answer. When an MRI showed what might have been an hypoxic event affecting her brain stem  we were told by our neurologist to “go hike the Himalayas with her or get to Disneyland ” before it was too late. That was a many-tears breakdown and a why us  why me  why her stage of our lives. When she was undergoing her 5 surgeries to fix the pressure in her eyes from glaucoma  it was mostly  please let her be able to see  please let her not have a seizure when she wakes up from the anesthesia  please let her eyes be ok. In the ICU in 2017  after she was intubated following a 90-minute seizure  my question was  Why does she need to suffer so?  There are a lot of questions with no good answers.All of the hospital stays tend to become a blur  but a few things always stand out: how hard it is to get an IV in  and keep it in because Calliope is a “tough stick” as they say  her veins are so irregular. So there’s a lot of poking and rubbing and visualizing the blood flowing  just please let them find the right spot and let the blood flow. There’s lots of “please let’s”: please let the same nurse who we like be here tomorrow  please let the blood results be good  please let the EEG not show any seizures  please let us go home soon  please let Calliope regain whatever she may have lost during this latest episode and continue progressing. Please  please  please.Our darkest times have been mirrored by countless shining times: when she first held her head up  at age 2  when she sat by herself  at 3  when she stood with assistance  at 4  when she started taking steps with assistance  at 5  when she started using a potty successfully  at 6. Her strength and guts and spirit astonish me. Just eating ice cream with her on a summer day is something. The other side of why us is  she’s a miracle  she’s Calliope  and she is who she was meant to be. I’m writing because we’ve come to a point where we need to ask for help to continue helping Calliope in the best ways we know how. We’ve had an amazing amount of financial and moral support from our immediate family and a dear friend  for which we couldn’t be more grateful. But as we look to do things that will make a lasting difference over the long-term  the price tags get steeper  and so does the burden on our families.Special needs tend to have “special” price tags attached. For our family  it means medical bills  therapy bills  the special equipment Calliope requires  and much more. The list is long and keeps expanding.Help us make it possible for Calliope to continue to reach her full potential:ACCESSIBLE VAN: $50 000We’re currently using an old Camry  amazingly donated to us by my brother and sister-in-law. But getting Calliope into a car seat from her stroller and vice versa is getting more difficult the bigger she gets. A growing six-year old at close to 40 pounds  she’s more than a handful to maneuver (especially in rain or snow  which seems to be a thing whenever we have to get somewhere for a medical appointment). We need to invest in an accessible van to make it possible for us to get where we need to go  whether it’s for Calliope’s care or  better yet  new family adventures. And an accessible van means that when we go to appointments or travel  we won’t have to worry about where to change Calliope. Hard to believe  but there are generally no changing options for disabled people who are not the size of babies. ABM NEUROMOVEMENT LESSONS AND TRAINING: $30 000Calliope has had thousands of hours of physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech therapy  feeding therapy  vision therapy  music therapy and hippotherapy. She’s one of the hardest working people you’ll ever see. For her to hold a fork with food on it and bring it to her mouth (which she can!) takes probably more concentration and focus than what would be required for you or me to parallel park a tractor-trailer.Calliope has come an incredibly long way  but of course we’re always looking for ways to continue to help her to reach her full potential. In June 2017 I discovered the Anat Baniel Method (ABM)  a body movement therapy that is known to be especially helpful for special needs children. ABM capitalizes on the premise of neuroplasticity by helping the brain change itself  guided by very gentle movements.ABM is based on the work of Moshe Feldenkrais  who you can read about here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/well/trying-the-feldenkrais-method-for-chronic-pain.html?_r=0 As the neuroanatomist and author of My Stroke of Insight Jill Bolte Taylor says about ABM: \By shifting the focus of rehabilitation from the muscles and bones to the brain  we unleash the staggering potential of the brain to heal itself.\"" We tried ABM over the summer of 2017  and both Calliope and I loved it. Our amazing NYC practitioners  Sharon and Marcy  are masters at helping Calliope understand what her body  and by extension her brain  are capable of. We saw positive changes in her mood  her connection to her body  the range of her movements  and her vision as a result of ABM lessons. Calliope was born with a sweet temperament  but since ABM  she’s been laughing  smiling and generally taking more joy in herself and her life. Meanwhile  I started to become fascinated by the method itself  and how it could help people  and in the fall of 2017  with the financial and moral support of dear friends and family  and most importantly  Pat  I started the training to become an ABM practitioner myself.I’ll be graduating from my basic training in January  which means I’ll be certified to work with adults. In order to work with children  I also need to take the Children’s Mastery course next year  which will finish in November 2019. The course next year  including travel and additional childcare expenses  will cost approximately $18 000.In addition to my ongoing training  we feel it’s crucial for Calliope to receive ongoing ABM lessons over the next year from seasoned practitioners in NYC  which cost around $1 000 per month.So the idea is that  to create a space for ABM to help Calliope on an ongoing basis  I’m learning everything I can to be able to provide ABM for her myself over the coming years. In the meantime  though  we need help/support to reach that goal.We’ve always been surrounded by an amazing community of family and friends on our Calliope journey  all of whom have already helped us so much. We’re hoping to expand the reach of this community with this campaign  so please share with anyone you feel would want to help  and that includes on Facebook or wherever else you think it could have an impact. Thanks for reading and helping in any way you can  you have all our gratitude and love.  - Ariana Speyer and Pat Sullivan  Calliope's parentsSUMMARY:- $50 000 for accessible van: Family members have already pledged to match all donations up to $25 000- $18 000 for ABM Children’s Mastery tuition  travel expenses  and additional childcare- $12 000 for one year of ABM lessons for Calliope- $20 000 for ongoing miscellaneous expenses  including medical bills  special equipment  supplementary childcare  and much more""",91991,100000,35,92,432,382,7
Brave Josiah Fights EB,https://www.gofundme.com/brave-josiah-fights-eb,7,WILMINGTON,DE,Our handsome nephew Josiah was born on October 5  2018 and what should have been the happiest day of any parents life ended with an incurable diagnosis. He was born with a very rare genetic disorder called EB or Epidermolyosis Bullosa. After Josiah was born he was rushed to Dupont due to having open sores on his hands  legs  and sores around and in his mouth. He is remaining in the NICU for wound care. EB is always painful  often pervasive and debilitating. The pain management and bandages will be needed for life. Josiah is currently awaiting genetic testing results to determine the severity of the disease he has.Epidermolysis Bullosa  or EB  is a very rare genetic connective tissue disorder that affects 1 child out of every 20 000 births (that means about 200 children a year are born with EB).  EB is actually a group of disorders that share a prominent manifestation of extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears from friction or trauma. Internal organs and bodily systems can also be seriously affected by EB.  The list of secondary complications can be long and may require multiple interventions from a range of medical specialists.  As of today  there is no cure or treatment.  Daily wound care  pain management and protective bandaging are the only options available. (See more at:  http://www.debra.org)Those born with Epidermolysis Bullosa are often called “Butterfly Children” because as the analogy goes  their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly.Josiah is going to need silk onesies  special diapers and bottles  and special detergent because of his extremely fragile and sensitive skin among other items. As he gets older these everyday costs will only increase  as will his medical care. Josiah is a happy and healthy baby. He has taken his wound dressing changes like a champ. He LOVES being with Mom and Dad. I would to as they are fantastic parents. We ask for continued support and prayers for Josiah’s physical healing and Mom and Dad’s emotional healing. Josiah is certainly a miracle baby and a handsome one at that! The future is unknown as of now and while it will be a long road ahead  Mom and Dad thank you for any prayers and thoughts you can send. Any support also will be greatly appreciated and will help in traveling expenses and Josiah’s medical care. We will keep you posted as we learn more.,5685,8000,7,71,79,992,6

The Booz family is over Flo.,https://www.gofundme.com/overflo,2,WALLACE,NC,Our parents  Huck and JoAnn Booz built their retirement home in Wallace  NC 18 years ago. In a blink of an eye that home was ruthlessly and severely flooded by Hurricane Florence.  With 5 feet of water in the garage and 30 inches in their 1 story home  the toxic river water destroyed everything in its path. Being unable to return to their home for over a week after the storm  led to catastrophic damage to the flooring  dry wall  furniture  cabinetry  appliances and most importantly  family treasures.We are extremely grateful and blessed that they are physically unharmed by the storm  but the emotional damage has been rough. After 51 years of marriage and no flood insurance they are rebuilding.We have amazing support of family and friends and we have vowed to get through this together with our faith in God. Many of you have helped tremendously with time and labor  and we sincerely thank you. Others have asked how they can help financially assist our parents to rebuild their home.

Ella me contacto recientemente  pidiéndome que le ayudara a crear y postear esta campana a través Gofundme  con el propósito de ayudar al joven Simón Torres Zerpa a recaudar los fondos necesarios para recuperar su salud y poder realizarle el tratamiento debido y a tiempo  siendo uno de los principales inconvenientes la dificultad de la procura de dichos fondos. Actualmente Venezuela enfrenta una grave crisis económica  que nos pone en una posición en donde la salud pasa a un plano donde entre encontrar los medicamentos y pagar el debido tratamiento que se requiere puede arruinar a una familia entera  ya que el pago se está exigiendo en dólares. Hasta el momento la solicitud o el requerimiento esta por el orden de los 1500 dólares. Es por ello que hemos conformado un pequeño equipo de amigos y conocidos llamado \""Aun hay esperanza para Simón\"" y estamos aportando de esta manera un pequeño grano de arena para masificar lo más posible la cooperación de muchos!

Help Gavin get to Mayo Clinic,https://www.gofundme.com/help-gavin-get-to-mayo-clinic,0,DUNN,NC,I will try my best to keep it short and simple. Everyone that follows Gavin knows our sweet tubie baby has had a LONG road to travel since birth. He was admitted to UNC Chapel Hill at 5 days old and we lived there for a very long 37 days! After weeks of sleepless nights and days of continuous tears he finally had surgery to have his G-tube placed so we could be discharged.  We have made the 2 hour trip to UNC countless times in the past few months trying to keep up with follow ups and tons of testing and ER visits. The last batch of testing done by Neurology showed a mutation in one of the genes that causes muscular dystrophy but he doesn't have two copies of it so that means he has some type of Congenital Muscular Disease but not sure exactly which one.  The testing at UNC is pretty much at a stand still since a few months ago they considered Gavin to be thriving. Anyone that keeps up with him thru Facebook knows that's not entirely the case.  Gavin has struggled severely during these last few months when it comes to his airway difficulties and Laryngomalacia   He still currently has problems aspirating and is collecting alot of scar tissue on his lungs with every aspiration. His feeding by mouth has slowed down and he's starting to lose weight again. He's also starting to miss cognitive milestones which is something we were afraid of since they said from the beginning his brain was normal. As parents our only jobs are to protect our children and be their advocate at all times! I've said from day one that I would travel the world to get what he needed if I had to. Well guys a blessing has very unexpectedly fallen into our laps and Gavin was just accepted into Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. This is an amazing opportunity that not all families are given. We will have to go out there for at least a week where he will see Neurology  Pulmonology  GI  ENT and Ortho. They will do their work ups and testing within that week and then work closely with UNC afterwards. I personally spoke with the Neuro Surgeon that will be over seeing his care and he sounded very optimistic about Gavin having a confirmed diagnosis and treatment plan. I spoke with the financial department and unfortunately they do not accept his insurance so all expenses  will be out of pocket. I am applying for their charity care program but we still have to have $5 000.00 upfront before we can be seen.  Everything after that will be billed to us or covered by the charity care program. I won't even go into how much all the testing will be if we are not approved by the charity care program. We are also responsible for our own travel expenses which will be about $3 000.00. We will most likely drive the 20 hour trip because it is about 600 dollars cheaper. Mayo clinic does offer Ronald McDonald housing but it is very hard to get into due to the amount of patients they have. There are Hotels near Mayo Clinic that offer discount prices to patients and their families. Even with that we are still looking at a pretty expensive trip. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't at least try to make this happen for him. If there is even a 1% chance they can find something UNC hasn't or provide more tools for his future then it is hands down worth it!! We are hoping to be out there the beginning of the year. Yes  Minnesota in January will be interesting!Nobody likes to be in the position where they have to ask for help financially but you do what you have to do when it comes to your children. We are asking if anyone is able to donate please do. Any amount will help us reach out goal of getting Gavin into one of the best hospitals in the world. If you are unable to donate then please help spread the word and share this page and send up some prayers that we are able to raise the money needed. We are working on other fundraiser options so please get in contact with me or Daniel if you have any suggestions. I will also be making T-Shirts with a #TeamGavin design that will go towards the trip.I also ask that anyone who donates PLEASE keep documentation of the amount given so if by some chance we are not able to make this trip happen then we can make sure all donations are returned. I want to say Thank you in advance to anyone who donates or shares this page or keeps him in your thoughts and prayers. Gavin has a strong support system behind him and you guys are amazing!,205,8000,3,3,5,146,6

My Melanoma,https://www.gofundme.com/d265yd-my-melanoma,1,SCOTTSBLUFF,NE,I am 49 and found out a month ago that I have late Stage Metastatic  Melanoma . It is fortunate that the cancer was found   because there is no identifiable Tumor or original Melanoma. A CT technician caught an enlarged Lymph node in an unrelated CT scan. 5 metastatic lymph nodes have been found  in the last month since the original lymph node was discovered. This stages me between 3c and 4. My survival rate at this point is fair to moderate after 5 years. Of course I’m going to fight this with every bone in my body   I have three boys and both they and my future grand babies need me.  I need them. I am overly impressed and fully confident in the care I’m getting  at the UC Denver Hospital’s Melanoma clinic. I’ve been able to let go and place The cancer treatment in my Physicians hands.  The treatment center Is a 4 hour drive from where I live and so far I’ve been there at least 2 times a week since I was first seen. I was told this week that the treatment approach will very aggressive and so I know I will continue to travel to Denver at least two times a week. Travel time and expenses ( the price of Gas  Food.  and an occasional hotel room if a surgical procedure is planned) has already started to become a financial strain to my family. I’m a very proud person and do not take charity easily. Having a “Go Fund Me”page was never in my plans.it’s probably not In anyones plans   But I know in order to get the best care   my expenses will quickly become a burden. So thank you very much for your help,2800,5000,11,56,25,183,7
Putting Food OnThe Table As We Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/qjbgwa-fighting-the-battle-against-cancer,0,LOSANGELES,CA,"This past two years has been a very long and very painful and overwhelming experience…filled with much hardship and immense suffering in many many ways… especially with a long-time highly toxic and negative environment where I was working and also on the home front with all of the medical issues and overwhelming costs. The constant pressure of all you will read that follows  has taken a toll on me  even as I stay steady and strong as I can.   I am reaching out now because I am in an urgent and dire desperate financial circumstance leading up to my wife's second cancer surgery in two weeks  if her cancer has not spread.I need to stay strong for my wife and my children...and the constant financial worry and the intense pressure has left me  needing to urgently urgently reach out  for immediate help financially.I cannot do this nor bear this alone any longer:Two years ago my son Morgan who is now 10  was rushed to UCLA pediatric ICU.   He spent a week in intensive care… And I was told that had another 10 or 12 hours past  I very well may have lost him   as he was nearly in a diabetic coma.  There were and continue to be unforeseen expenses that then skyrocketed regarding his medical needs and lifestyle needs due to this huge change.   He has an amazing soul and spirit! These costs continue and have increased and increased as has the insurance which does not begin to cover all costs. I need to get Morgan an insulin pump. This will greatly greatly help his ongoing diabetes treatment and allow him to feel more like a kid again… And to feel more like all of his friends and the kids around him in school etc.…  My daughter Megan has been extraordinary!During the next year  there were serious family issues: my sister's cancer… My nephew breaking his back… My stepdad's emergency triple bypass surgery...the hospitalization of my father  and the recent loss of my uncle who was like a dad to me for many many decades . Obviously these are very deep emotional experiences.Then one year ago  my wife had a sudden diagnosis of stage III cancer. The picture was taken one week before receiving the diagnosis.There has been so much trauma associated with a close loved one and the mother of my two young kids being diagnosed with stage III cancer… And not knowing how to answer when each of my kids asked me in the last 24 hours and continue to ask me every day \will mom be ok\""...\""are you ok  Dad\"" and \""how long is mom going to live?\"" The financial hardships that have accompanied the need for childcare for my son Morgan and my daughter Megan since their mom has been bedridden much of the past year… The skyrocketing cost of health insurance… Which went up over the last two years between 36 and 47%… (I did not have insurance through my employment) has been unbearable and overwhelmingIt is now increasing another 9%The costs not covered by insurance…just for prescriptions  for example  has been many many thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars...(chemo medication  etc)The  payments for medicinal and other supplies for my wife and for my son that are not covered by insurance  have been monumental and are ever increasing. The medical treatment and accompanying related costs etc. have literally kept both the mother of my kids and my son alive over this past year… And we still have a long way to go. My wife has at least one more major surgery coming up in about 2 weeks if the cancer has not spread… yes even with the holidays comingAnd all of the costs associated with that and the after care for her  for my kids  the additional prescription costs and medicinal supply costs that will be coming...is beyond comprehension. I have transitioned away from where I was working.  Many of you know firsthand that what I was constantly subjected to and experiencing there for years was traumatic  brutal and very unhealthy and no longer tolerable.....I would not have needed to start a Go Fund Me Campaign otherwise.This has left me with a desperate struggle to just pay the bills/basic necessities: Clearly   I need to maintain and keep our health insurance… The medical bills already have run well over $250 000… With more to come  As I transition into another employment position… Which I trust and pray will happen sooner rather than later  I am fighting hard to keep our home… To put food on the table… To pay Health insurance and medical costs… To keep a vehicle so that I can get back-and-forth to work… I need a reliable clean safe car especially with two young kids To provide for my kids To keep the power and utilities on… Etc.  All savings that existed have been exhausted since the onset of my wife's cancer.When times have been good for me financially… Which I have faith they will be again in the future… I have helped so many many family members  friends  charities  schools  temples  churches  hospitals etc....causes and strangers  as many many of you are personally aware. I am getting up every day… Doing my best to stay strong and steady and positive… For my wife… Of course for my children and being their rock… And staying steady for myself as well.  I would not wish all that I have suffered and experienced over the past several years on anyone.  I am reaching out as one who has always given from the heart   and on my own time....as one who has put in 1000% into my work and career…despite the truth of what I was subjected to.And as so many of you know   I am definitely one who has always generously given back to individuals  charities  schools  etc...as well as the community at large.  I and my family desperately and urgently immediately need your help now. I cannot do this alone any longer.   Thank you for your kindness and got your caring.We are very very grateful and your support is making all the difference in the world.Steve  Eva  Megan and Morgan""",9401,20000,22,47,51,129,6
Ajuda para voltar ao Brasil,https://www.gofundme.com/8p54k-ajuda-para-voltar-ao-brasil,3,Lugarno,NSW,AJUDA PARA VOLTAR AO BRASIL - Ataque cardíaco + infarto (o dia que ele morreu e voltou a viver) Oi  pessoal. Este é o Nelson  54 anos Personagem da matéria feita pela Recorde sobre os brasileiros que vieram buscar um futuro melhor para os filhos na Austrália. Segue o link  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eoi1islkvpg&t=27s  . No dia 25/09 seu sonho se tornou um pesadelo que ele tem enfrentado sem minha família por perto. Eram 11h da manhã  estava em casa saindo para trabalhar quando sentiu uma forte dor no peito  como se a garganta estivesse sendo bloqueada. Neste momento comecou a suar tanto que ficou todo molhado. Tentou deitar mas a dor só piorava. Ligou para o serviço de emergência mas não conseguia se expressar direito. Achou que eles nem viriam  ligou então desesperado pedindo ajuda de um amigo  mas em poucos minutos a ambulância chegou. Os paramédicos perceberam que estava infartando e fizeram os primeiros socorros. Ao chegar no hospital uma equipe já estava esperando e foi nesse momento que ele perdeu os sentidos e passou pela experiência da morte. Deus o presenteou mais uma vez com o dom da vida por meio de um milagre  como dizem os médicos  e após alguns minutos da parada cardíaca ele foi ressuscitado com sucesso. Ainda inconsciente voltou ao quarto  que foi sua estadia até o dia 3/10.  Sua situação ainda é grave e exige cuidados. Pelas próximas 6 semanas os médicos o proibiram de fazer esforços e andar de avião  pois ainda tem risco de vida. Neste momento tudo que ele mais gostaria era de voltar ao aconchego da família no Brasil. Sei que nosso povo é muito solidário e acolhedor.Grato desde ja.Filipi Luiz,6205,11000,34,56,367,344,7
Medical and Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-and-recovery-fund-rogal,0,BLOOMFIELDHILLS,MI,"Mom always says  \Find the Pony\"" - it's to remind me to be more optimistic.She said we'll find our pony $5 at a time.    Can you help?I’m William Rogal  a grateful  “chosen” kid.  My mom says  “God put us together or a reason” and she’s right.  I’m a better person because we are together through adoption.  I can see the stress all of this is taking on her.  Please read our story.What’s happening:I am scheduled for another hip surgery on October 9th and will face a 6-week recovery; hooked up to a motion machine and ice water circulation pump for two weeks  semi-mobile for another four weeks.  I need her help and she needs yours.Who we are:My mom  Sandy is very devoted.  Sometimes she’s too devoted.   She’s stubborn  smart  and proud.  Sometimes she’s too proud.  Here’s our story and why we need some interim help:My mom dissolved her entire IRA over the years to pay for my education.  I have a few learning disabilities  which are now better addressed  but when they were not properly diagnosed  my mom kept me in small schools and it cost her everything. She retaught almost every lesson to me because in her words  “You’re a smart kid  you just learned differently”.   She never gave up on me even though at times my dad and the system did.   When I was still struggling in school  she sold her original art  her jewelry  and our piano to take me to DC for a brain scan.  It changed my life.A lifelong reading comprehension issue – something my diagnosis and medications can’t fix  - is one of my disabilities.  I can read  but I don’t process it unless I hear it in audio format and when not available  mom is my reader.  I have ADD and anxiety – she helps keep me organized and has talked me off the edge in the middle of more than one panic attack.  She is helping me get through school and helping me get ready for life.  Since she sold her favorite things to get me that brain scan  I’ve been on the Dean’s List – quite the turnaround from barely passing.  I credit my mom’s determination – her teaching  her silly memorization games – for my continued success.  Placing the needs of others before her own:She’s nursed me through 8 ankle fractures  a hip surgery two years ago  and a hospitalization for removing a kidney stone we named “Fred”.  (Told ya’ she is silly)I’m not the only one she’s taken care of.  My mom moved my grandpa in so he could die with dignity surrounded by family  took care of my grandmother during the day when she was going through chemo and later broke her hip and needed rehab.  She has always been there for others and won’t complain because no matter how bad it gets she says  “Remember  son  we are blessed.”  She even counted her blessings when she had to have a titanium plate in her neck due to degenerative disc disease and was partially paralyzed on one side.  That was only 3 years into our new life.I’m not quite done needing my mom  - especially with my surgery next week.  Mom would like to take care of me (I’d like it too).  As I said  I’m going to be totally dependent for 6 weeks.  She’s my nurse  my reader  my cook  and my driver.A little history – what happened:My parent’s divorce settlement dragged on for 13 years through 4 different courts – and you guessed it – the lawyers got most of the settlement as well as most of the back underpaid child support for 8 of those years.  It finally ended this year.  Dad promised to bankrupt her and did.  In addition to what I believe is the longest divorce in history  my mom had to fight a couple of bogus ex parte actions by my dad and his powerful legal team – one was a custody grab.  We won  but it was at great expense – both financially and emotionally.   Don’t get me wrong  I love my dad  but he did not treat her fairly.  He has now stepped up to pay for my college and I’m very grateful.  But my mom is still my tutor  my inspiration  my moral compass  and I can’t let her down. Every day she tells me  “Make me proud.”  Her favorite reminder when I get down is  “Forgive  forget  and live your best life.  Be humble  be honorable  and you will be blessed.”    We’re not feeling blessed right now  but I know some of you are really good people. She was going to finish college when the back child support was finally paid.  She had 3 years under her belt – 2.5 after they evaluated transfer credits.   The majority of that money went fast to her new lawyer (first one retired) and paying off personal loans (be honorable).  She drives a 12-year-old car (be humble) and says she hopes to get another 10 years out of it.  Somehow  I think she will. (EDIT:  I just realized her car is 14 years old  bought in 2006!) When we volunteer together at shelters and soup kitchens  I get the reminder of how blessed we are to have a home and our own beds.  But that’s about to change unless we get a little help.She needs to get a meaningful job and finish her degree in Business Administration.  She was a successful industry and philanthropic leader before she adopted me  but it’s been more than a decade since she worked full time and now degrees are required.In the meantime we need to keep the roof over our heads – can you help?  Our immediate needs:Our mortgage was due this week.  We have a shutoff notice from the electric company  and while not yet late  our gas bill is unpaid. Our living expenses run about $3 000 per month (w/o unexpected repairs).Our goal of $11 000 will go toward:·      2 or 3 months mortgage  taxes  insurance ($1800/mo) during my recovery.·      Utilities  car insurance  home association dues ($510/mo)·      Food  fuel and maintenance  my medication co-pay ($750/mo)(Edit) Mom’s plea:So honored to know you’ve read this far.  As a self-sufficient provider  a lifelong volunteer of my time and resources  I never imagined this would be my plight – but I have to swallow my pride or lose everything.  We suffered some unanticipated emergency expenses in 2018 that drained us.  The car is repaired as is the mower  and we now have an operating refrigerator.  At 57  I’m literally starting over.  It’s humiliating to ask anyone to share his or her hard earned money.  As my son reminded me  If only half of my social media followers gave $5 each  we would get through this crisis to meet our immediate needs.Please know from the bottom of my heart I am grateful for any assistance you can provide to get us through our temporary  desperate time.We promise to keep you updated on every step of this new journey.  If you can’t contribute  please say a heartfelt prayer for us and please share our story with others.  Thank you.""",11028,11000,42,100,214,90,7

New Beginnings During&amp;After Divorce,https://www.gofundme.com/680ccz4,0,LAREDO,TX,I am a struggling woman. A wife of nearly 20 years. A mother of two children whom still remain at home. Facing the most difficult time in my entire life. A very independent humble loving woman I know I am. For my entire marriage I relied of and entrusted my life to one man. For most of all my marriage I contributed not only my hard working abilities to help maintain a household  but my fight to keep a marriage going. A lot of tears and heartache came with that fight. And a lot of mental and emotional abuse came with it too. My heart has been completely shattered to know that even after all that effort his fight to do the same was not with in him to do. I feel broken and worthless. My faith has been tested. My will to survive has been challenged. If it weren’t for so many of you reaching out to me  loving me through this  praying for myself and my children I do not know where I’d be. But More importantly God. I have made my mistakes. There are really no excuses. I can only ask my friends and family who remain faithful in me to please dig deep in their hearts enough to see beyond my faults as I ask for your help. I’ve neglected my health. I struggle daily to keep gas in my car and provide a sense of security with in my children to not go with out. Our home is up for auction Nov 6  2018 due to his negligence to pay the HOA dues. I have no idea what will happen to myself and my children in the upcoming days. I do not have trust in him to do the right thing for my regard. His recent offer to me was such a slap to the face. His threats of taking my children away from me and his attempts to brainwash my children to believe I can not provide for them are his main goals it seems. It is not my intent to bash the man I love and have loved for almost 1/2 my life. I cry for him daily. I don’t say that as if it’s tears running down my face it is a cry that comes from my gut and is heard for prolly miles. My cry for help is felt by so many that have daily contact with me. And for that I am truly sorry. The truth is just that simple. I want my life back. I want my children to know their mom is worthy. Is capable. Is strong. Is healthy. I know this to shall pass. I got to get through this. I humbly ask for your help. I have a lot for sale. If anything please come see what I have. Please God... carry me and continue to give me the strength to get through this. Amen. Thank you all and I love you with everything I am.,240,1000,22,24,5,13,6

What's happening to him and his family is just not fair.Trent has been battling IPF for much longer than most people know. This disease is ugly. It has no cure.

Anyone who is close to a child who suffers from autism knows how difficult it is for the child to have a normal life  but I have learned of a treatment which could give him a real chance.The CDC estimates that about one in every 59 children is on the autism spectrum  and more than half of those affected also suffer from some form of intellectual disability. One of the things which makes autism so difficult to deal with is the fact that each case is different from the next. In Keenan's case  the biggest problems are rooted in his lack of reasoning ability and severe behavioral problems.He frequently puts himself in danger by giving strangers access to his personal information  often online  and his oppositional nature results in devastating behavioral problems. He also struggles immensely in school. His education level is between third and sixth grade  but he should be in tenth grade. Because of all his problems  he is also suicidal at times  and it just breaks my heart.I've been concerned about Keenan all his life. When Keenan was born  there was a major complication. His head became stuck in the birth canal  resulting in hypoxia. Because his oxygen was almost entirely cut off during birth  his brain has not been able to develop at the usual rate  which resulted in autism and other problems.  I began urging his parents while he was young to take him to a doctor to find out what was wrong. One of the things I observed was that he very rarely cried during infancy  but when he did  he cried uncontrollably for exceptionally long periods of time. At the age of two  his behavior was so out of control that he was suspended from daycare.By the age of three  when most children are talking  he still only spoke gibberish. Eventually  his father brought him to live with me when he was five  and at that time  I began seeking an answer for his extreme meltdowns  which required that he be manually restrained. It took many years to reach the diagnosis  and I have been an advocate for him all this time.However  I have now learned of a stem cell treatment which could bring healing for Keenan. The Stem Cell Institute in Panama has shown great success in treating autism and other serious health problems using stem cells from umbilical cords. Keenan will receive stem cells via an IV over five days  and then those stem cells should bring healing. Although the treatment is not 100% effective  the Stem Cell Institute seems to have a great track record of success in treating autism.We have been in contact with them for more than a month and have already submitted the required test results and lab work to find out if Keenan is a good candidate for the treatment. At this time  he does fit the criteria  but unfortunately  we are on a rather short timeline. He turns 16 in November  and the Stem Cell Institute has said that after he turns 17  the treatment will no longer be effective.The fee for his treatment is $17 800  and we must also pay our travel expenses. We are seeking help paying for the treatment and what we hope will be a better life for Keenan. We are also trusting in Jehovah-Rapha  the God who heals  to use this treatment to bring lasting change in this young man's life. We will be grateful for any help you are able to provide  and thank you so much for reading our story and for your consideration.Blessings Makeyah DaurhamNew Orleans  Louisiana,1621,17800,19,9,37,125,6
Help Chelsea Come Home,https://www.gofundme.com/680irnk,9,Brooklands,NZ,This is the story of my beautiful Guide Daughter  Chelsea. She is with out a doubt the strongest  most inspiring little girl who has overcome so many obstacles that life has thrown at her. She has done so with endless support from her equally strong family who are now putting plans in place on how to bring Chelsea home. Below is Chelsea’s story. Your time to read her story is very much appreciated and any donation will go along way in supporting this beautiful family. Over the past three months Chelsea has been in the Queensland Children’s Hospital Intensive Care Unit fighting so hard to overcome an ongoing lung and chest infection  which has seen her test positive for many different types of pneumonia caused to her by silently aspirating but also from a bacterial bug. In this time she has required a massive amount of respiratory support which included her being intubated for some time.Chelsea has a rare condition called Miller Dieker Lissencephaly which is a chromosomal condition and also affects her brain.With in this hospital admission she has also been diagnosed with a floppy and thinning of her airways.In September   Doctors informed the family that the outlook for Chelsea was grim and too prepare for the worst as her lungs were so sick and there was nothing more they could do for her. She is now under the Palliative care team. However  over the past few weeks Chelsea has managed to fight back and has proved that she is a strong little girl and is now managing on low flow oxygen which is amazing compared to the outlook we were given just a few short weeks ago.It is looking likely if Chelsea continues in the correct direction she will get to go home requiring constant monitoring   suctioning and have oxygen at all times.Whilst in hospital Chelsea has been attached to many machines monitoring her oxygen levels and heart rate etc. Although when she goes home she will not have any such monitoring as the hospital does not supply such a Rescource. Chelseas oxygen levels vary dramatically and so it is important she gets the correct monitoring. Such a machine costs approximately $3000 for the initial set up but will have ongoing costs. We are reaching out if any one can donate whatever they can to make the possibility of Chelsea being able to go home a reality and to be home together as a family.Every little bit will help and will be greatly appreciated and anything above and beyond our goal will be used for Chelsea’s on going medical needs. Money can’t buy health but it can buy things that makes Chelsea more comfortable. ❤️,5440,3000,15,181,60,289,6
Valley Fever,https://www.gofundme.com/680n94o,9,ApacheJunction,AZ,Hi  I’m 23  a workaholic and suddenly very ill. After a chaotic two month period of misdiagnosis and over-radiating me with tests and taking so much blood they could start a small blood bank  everything came back as inconclusive. I’m still undergoing a lot of the same tests currently after being rushed to the hospital with tachycardia and the potential upset of a blood clot in my lung. I had a high fever of 102 when admitted and they couldn’t find a reason for it. After being sent home with pain pills for the pain in my chest and an inhaler to help me breathe  as well as a referral to a cardiologist  I still just wasn’t feeling right. I went to the cardiologist  he ran more tests and determined that I had a mitral valve prolapse. They placed me on a beta blocker to lower my heart rate. Soon After  I wasn’t feeling any better. I was actually starting to feel worse. So I went back to the Er  a different one than the previous. Explained the situation  more radiation. Turns out I have two nodules in my lung and a bad case of valley fever. I keep getting denied for disability through my Insurance at work and I just want to be able to make bills. Started coughing blood up and having bloody noses randomly along with spiked fever and heart rate. Will be getting holter monitor  echocardiogram  and stress test soon from a different cardiologist. This page is to keep updates on my medical status as well hopefully make ends meet until I can afford a disability attorney. Sharing  donating  anything helps. Thank you so much. I’m looking to pay doctors  car payment  labs and the medications. Thank you.,350,3000,10,12,7,55,5
Jackson&apos;s Pompe Research Trip,https://www.gofundme.com/jackson039s-pompe-research-trip,0,OAKCREEK,WI,"The sweet  happy  adorable face you see is the face of 6 month old Jackson.    Shortly after birth  Jackson's mom received the call that absolutely no parent ever wants to receive. \It is an emergency  please bring your baby in immediately.\"" It was the call that changed everything. Lives will never be the same. Jackson's blood test from newborn screenings showed he had tested positive for something called Pompe Syndrome. The best way for me  not a medical professional to describe Pompe is to say this: Pompe syndrome is a rare  inherited  sometimes fatal disorder that disables the heart and skeletal muscles. It is caused by mutations in a gene that makes an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA).  Basically is causes continued muscle weakness and heart problems. There is so much more to it. I ask you to please look up Pompe Syndrome and research it or better yet take a moment to say Hello to Jackson's parents.... Ask his mom Melissa how it is every time she has to walk thru the doors at Children's Hospital or you could ask her about her sleepless nights watching her baby to make sure he is breathing okay. How about the heart scan's and blood work he has to endure while all his parents can do is watch. This is a 6month old baby.....he will do all of that for the rest of his life! I can not begin to imagine.  I can not put into words how unpleasant the face of Pompe is.  Right now there is no cure.   In Spring of 2019 Jackson and his parents will be taking a trip to Duke University. At that time Jack will undergo even more testing and meet with an entire team of specialist from cardiologist  pulmonologist  physical therapist  audiologist  speech therapist  occupational therapist and the geneticist all for Pompe. Jack's parents will learn all they can about Pompe during a 2 day conference as well. This is will ensure Jack gets the best treatment possible and the hope is to give Jackson the very best life he can have.  It all comes at a cost!    Like many of us  Jackson's parents bust their asses making a living to support their children  home and now medical bills in this ever demanding society. Taking a week off of work can be impossible if you can't afford to.  Taking a trip simply isn't in the budget when the mortgage needs to be paid and maintenance on your home can't wait.  Well this is where all of you come in.....We are asking everyone and anyone to please make a donation so Jackson's parents can go Duke this Spring for Pompe Research without the stress and anxiety of worrying about paying for this trip and the stress and anxiety of missing a week's pay from work.  Recently his parents drained  their savings because their house needed all new pipes  (as someone in the trades....that is unbelievably expensive  like new car or a trip expensive). Let's help lighten the load and give them one less thing to worry about.   Lets all come together to help Jackson  his Mom Melissa  his Dad Rick and big Brother Logan. We love you all so much!""",1600,10000,9,16,13,110,6
Steven Larson Cancer Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/steven-larson-cancer-treatment,9,MUKILTEO,WA,I was diagnosed with Liver Cancer following a surgical hernia repair in April of this year.  I have since begun chemo therapy which required a placement of a port in my chest. This was the first large medical bill to come in. Whenever I visit my Oncologist  I am required to pay a $40 copay. I was recently placed in the hospital on  two occasions for pain control. We have a mortgage payment that must be dealt with as well as utilities  phone  internet  etc. that adds to our escalating bills. We were barely able to manage payment on last months mortgage due to all these awful medical bills.  Essentially  we both feel as we are aboard a fast sinking ship.. I cannot work and am currently on social security and a small Teamster Pension.   My wife works as a local home health care provider  but her wage is not much.  We wish to implore all persons who come across this post and ask that you contribute to help us from this slump.  We are both devout Christians that attend the Presbyterian church in nearby Mukilteo.  In the name of our savior Christ we wish to thank all who see this and who are able to offer assistance to me and my family.  We are in quite a predicament for sure. So any loving support will be much appreciated and welcome. Bless you all.....,700,8900,10,8,7,62,6

Help Us Heal from our Family Travesty,https://www.gofundme.com/travelingrockstars,0,ACTON,CA,"In the last 3 years  I have been diagnosed with Lyme disease  tumors on my ovaries (painful fibroids)   several different parasites and amoebas  Ulcerative colitis  two forms of Epstein-Barr virus  Varicella zoster virus  severe E-coli  as well as several other autoimmune diseases. Hi  my name is Tiffany Kelley and I am here to tell you our story about how travesty hit my family and how my husband and I are taking what we have gone through  and using it to be able to help people.  We will be using a YouTube channel as our platform to do motivational speaking and also give resources on how to work online while we learn ourselves. We have a passion for teaching  and with our empathy as our ammo  we want to show people that your dreams are possible no matter what life has thrown at you!  This story began when I fell ill only two months after my husband and I returned from our Honeymoon in Mexico.  Four months later in April of 2017  I finally had to leave work because I had so much stomach pain and I was too weak to stand to do my job as a hairstylist.  And As fate would have it   two months after having to leave work from my illness   my husband Kris  got into a motorcycle accident sliding 45 MPH down the 405 Freeway in Seattle and was badly injured with several broken bones and unable to move at all for several months.  He also at that time was unable to return to work and lost his job working at Microsoft as an Event Coordinator.With little to no options while stuck in bed sick and injured  we decided to learn how to work from home online. We started several businesses and learned a ton but failed at most (like most young new entrepreneurs do on their first time around) and eventually ran out of money to be able to continue to buy inventory for our only successful venture of selling our own branded products on Amazon. We did all this while also still paying rent and bills and also all the money going out trying to create a new business and finally used up  all of our savings and the loans that we took out to start a business.Eventually  his girls that I had raised as my own with him for 4 years  decided to go live with their mom full time because they felt bored because we were unable to play with them like we used to. We didn't blame them for not wanting to be around us because we were always in bed sick and our attention was on the computer while we were trying like hell to start a business so our family would survive and not fall apart. But  sadly  they left us and we lost our kids to top off everything that was falling apart in our lives that we felt like we had no control over. I at that point was bed ridden  I had lost 50 lbs  and was losing my hair all while taking care of my broken husband who's bones were weirdly not healing.  It was rough! At that time Kris's grandmother passed and left him $5000 and scared we would become homeless and run out of money before either of us were well enough to work  we bought a Motorhome/ RV to move into with that $5 000.  And with the girls gone  and a house on wheels  we decided to  leave Seattle to see if the cold rainy weather with mold and mildew in our house had anything to do with my illness. I now only have 5-10 bed ridden \bad days\"" a month by naturally healing myself with herbs and supplements  which is pretty expensive and not covered by insurance.   We also drove our home to California looking for sunshine and Vitamin D to help us heal.  We are a Long way from being completely healthy  but with the money you donate  I can possibly look into other methods of healing besides Western Medicine as they seem to always just refer me to someone new and never help me to a cure.  It doesn't matter what life has given us  we just get back up (when I can)  brush ourselves off and makes some Damn Lemonade! We want to  finally be able to build our dream business we have put blood  sweat and tears into (literally) while learning how to perfect from years of trial and error!  We will be using the money you donate to make help us get better physically  and be able to afford the food  medicine and herbs we need to attempt to heal naturally.  It would also help us build our business that is our only option for work  so that we can get back on our feet while not being able to make it to an actual job (with my illness not being predictable I would be fired quickly from any job I attempted to get).   For the business  we would be able to purchase the professional equipment we need such as cameras  shooting materials  office supplies and also gas money to get to locations (because it’s not cheap having to drive our house to different locations- since our motorhome is our main transportation for now). Your donations would mean the World to us and would help to finally be able to heal and help other people that have been hit with life trials and tribulations and show them that things can get better!""",125,5000,8,3,5,53,2

Peggy&apos;s silent living hell,https://www.gofundme.com/peggy039s-silent-living-hell,0,MIAMI,OK,Where to begin?     I am writing this post on behalf of my sister.  Her name is Peggy.  She just turned 44 in September.  She is not married and she does not have any children.  What Peggy does have is a severe learning disability  a loving family  and a silent killer known as stage 4 cervical cancer.The diagnosis.     At the beginning of September my mom took Peggy to the doctor because she was having a period that lasted all month with excessive heavy bleeding.  The primary care physician did some blood tests and found that Peggy's blood count was low and that she needed a blood transfusion.  The doctor also referred Peggy to a gynecologist.     At this point you should know that Peggy has always gotten PAP smear tests every 3 years and they have always came back normal.  So  Peggy goes to see the gynecologist and he decides that she will need to have a DNC done to get everything cleaned out.  This is when we got the news that completely blindsided us.  Peggy has cervical cancer.  After the gynecologist gave us the news he scheduled an MRI to see if the cancer had spread to other parts of her body.  Once again we received terrible news; the cancer has spread to Peggy's liver and both of her lungs.     From here the gynecologist referred us to a gynecology oncologist in Kansas City.  All of this happened very quickly.  From the time she saw her primary care physician to the time Peggy saw the gynecology oncologist was a two week span.The treatment.      When we went to see the oncologist he was very concerned and straight forward about Peggy's situation.  He let us know this was close to the worst case of cervical cancer that he had ever seen.  He scheduled two different scopes.  The first scope was to look inside of the bladder and the second scope was to look inside of the colon.  When we got to the hospital to have the scopes done we were told that both scopes combined would take 35-45 minutes.    However  roughly 15-20 minutes later we were called to the consultation room to speak with the oncologist.  As you might expect  we once again received bad news. The doctor explained that he could not do the scope of the bladder.  He told us that Peggy has a tumor in her pelvis that goes completely from one side to the other.  There is also a tumor that is coming out of her pee hole so he could not get the camera or a catheter inserted to look inside.  He also let us know that due to her bleeding being so heavy and her body being so irritated he did not do the colon scope.  At the same time all of this was going on Peggy also had to have another blood transfusion.     This brings us up to the end of September beginning of October.  Peggy had to have a PET scan  a MRI  meet with the radiation team  and have a CT simulation done.  All of these tests were leading up to radiation beginning.  On October 8th we will get all of the test results and Peggy will have her 4th radiation treatment.  She will have to have between 10-15 radiation treatments in total.  They are hoping that the radiation will do two things.  First that it will stop all of the bleeding and secondly that it will shrink the size of the tumor.What we need help with.     As I said before all of Peggy's testing and treatments are being done in Kansas City.  This is 2 hours one way from where we live.  Treatments are done Monday- Friday one treatment per day.     What we would like to be able to do is stay in a hotel while all of Peggy's treatments are ongoing.  However  we would also like to be able to go home on weekends so we can see our family if Peggy is feeling up to it.  On top of needing money for a hotel and fuel we would also need money for 3 meals per day to be able to stay in Kansas City.  We are currently going between Menorah hospital for testing  Research hospital for radiation treatments  and the Sarah Cannon cancer center to see her oncologist.     When Peggy is done with her radiation treatments she will begin chemotherapy which will also be in Kansas City.  In addition to asking for monetary help we are asking that you keep Peggy in your thoughts and prayers.  I will be posting updates as they become available.     Thank you in advance from Peggy  myself  and our family.  Please make this post public and share it with all of your friends and family.,2238,3000,12,75,39,261,6
Rally with Ryker,https://www.gofundme.com/rally-with-ryker,9,TULSA,OK,Ryker Grey Addison was born on 5-21-18 and is an identical twin. His sweet family (mom Shayla  dad Joseph  big brother Dax and twin Luka) lives in Tulsa  but have been in Houston at Memorial Hermann since March. Ryker and his twin Luka were mono-mono twins (same sac) so they were high risk for cord entanglement. Shayla was inpatient for monitoring from 27 weeks until the birth at 34 weeks. Shayla and her husband Joseph had to stay in Houston to make sure that when born (these twins can be born at anytime given any blood loss concerns with entanglement) they had the doctors that Ryker would need. He was diagnosed inutero with CDH (left) and a heart defect  double outlet right ventricle. Once he was born  he was also diagnosed with TEF - his trachea and esophagus were not attached and his esophagus was attached to his stomach. He had his CDH corrective surgery at two days old (He also got a gtube in this surgery). His left lung was compressed and is now finally showing on X-rays. He had TEF corrective surgery at 10 days old. He is soon to have his heart surgery. Shayla was Initially  heavily encouraged to terminate Ryker to “save” his twin  but she chose to have him. Luka is doing well and Ryker has been a warrior and has been improving. They have had a few emotional setbacks  with the last one being last week  but he is continually showing people that God is bigger than the mountains that may seem impossible to climb. The emotional and financial stress of temporarily moving their family to Houston while caring for their other two children and being at the hospital with Ryker  has been tremendous.

Un peu de r&#xE9;pit,https://www.gofundme.com/un-peu-de-repit,3,Saint-Hyacinthe,QC,Bonjour à vous qui lisez ceci! Je me présente  Stéphanie Bisson  maman de 3 enfants. Je fais appel à vous aujourd’hui car je crois sincèrement que votre implication pourrait grandement nous aider. Un de mes enfants  Noah  est né avec des problématiques de santé après une grossesse très difficile. Des nausées m’ont empêchée de fonctionner normalement jusqu’à la toute fin de ma grossesse et ont même entrainé mon hospitalisation. Des diagnostics lourds de conséquence Dès ses premiers jours  Noah a des difficultés pulmonaires. Il est rapidement déclaré asthmatique chronique. Il reçoit les mêmes traitements à l’âge de 2 ans que ceux d’un adulte avec une maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique. …Parallèlement  lorsqu’il a 18 mois  les médecins voient que Noah ne parle pas et ne réagit pas à son nom. Après de nombreux examens et évaluations  Noah est déclaré autiste  avec trouble modulo-sensoriel  dyspraxie motrice et verbale sévère  retard de langage  de compréhension et d’expression ainsi qu’hypotonie musculaire buccale. Vulnérabilité pulmonaire Jusqu’à tout récemment  les problèmes pulmonaires de mon fils restaient encore sans cause exacte. En juillet 2018  le diagnostic est tombé. Noah souffre d’une immaturité pulmonaire depuis sa naissance due à ma grossesse difficile. Son état peut être dégénératif.Les bienfaits de l’hyperbare Nous avons eu la chance d’effectuer  chez Oxysoins à Drummondville  une séance hyperbare. Nous envisageons  premièrement  une location de 40 jours à la maison pour permettre à Noah de mieux oxygéner les partie de son corps qui en ont besoin. Les bienfaits possibles et répertoriés : * Amélioration des capacités langagières * Meilleur système immunitaire * Augmentation de la qualité du sommeil et niveau d’énergie * Plus de tonus musculaire et force musculaire * Amélioration des capacités cognitives * Augmentation des aptitudes sociales * Effet anti-inflammatoire Levée de fonds Présentement une campagne de financement est active sur la plate-forme ‘’gofundme’’ ( www.gofundme.com/un-peu-de-repit). Notre but est de pouvoir louer la chambre hyperbare pour ensuite nous en procurer une. Nous désirons également avoir le moyen de répondre à d’éventuels besoins si la situation de Noah se dégrade. Nous acceptons les dons monétaires mais également matériels. Ces derniers seront mis aux enchères lors d’un encan silencieux ou offerts sous forme de prix lors d’un tirage. SVP au nom de Noah Morisseau  aidez-nous à lui offrir une meilleure vie. Stéphanie Bisson  fière maman de Noah!

Danielle &amp; Gastroparesis,https://www.gofundme.com/wa5eqw-gastroparesis,9,BEAVERCITY,NE,Gastroparesis  starving for a cure.$2995.00 has been donated through private donations and GoFundMe as of 12/21/2018. Danielle greatly appreciates everyone’s generosity and prayers.Thank you to all who have donated through the gofundme and those who have sent donations through the mail. We have found out the Enterra Therapy (stimulator) would cost around $40 000 and that does not include surgeon  hospital or Anesthesiologist. Finding a specialist that actually does the Enterra Therapy (and believes Danielle is a candidate) will be the first challenge and then insurance approving it will be the next one. Our first motility specialist is in Kansas City on the 24th. The picture is of our daughter Danielle. The first picture was taken on a Friday and the next picture was taken the following Monday. Gastroparesis has been a part of  her/our lives for 15 years. The last 3 to 4 months have been horrible for Danielle. Danielle has had to go the the ER almost every week for fluids and shots to help her to stop throwing up. She has also received several vitamin bags aka banana bags. Along with her numerous medications  we have added medications from the UK. Insurance does not cover medications that are not FDA approved nor some procedures that  are considered experimental  not to mention the travel expenses. We will start a new journey of going to several motility clinics here in the Midwest  but who knows where we will end up. Midwest  east coast or west coast  I will find a way. Danielle is in the process of finding out if she would qualify for someone in need of a stimulator. If so  it would be placed in her stomach. There are only a very small handful of specialists that do this procedure in the United States. Asking for help is very hard for us  but the expenses are racking up and there is nothing I wouldn’t do to help my child. If you feel like you can help in any way we will greatly appreciate it. If not  that’s ok too. We know times are tight for people. Prayers are greatly appreciated.Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach. Ordinarily  strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract. But if you have gastroparesis  your stomach's motility is slowed down or doesn't work at all  (Danielle’s does not work) preventing your stomach from emptying properly. Gastrospresis can interfere with normal digestion  cause nausea and vomiting  and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown. Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include:VomitingNauseaA feeling of fullness after eating just a few bitesVomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlierAcid refluxAbdominal bloatingAbdominal painChanges in blood sugar levelsLack of appetite Fatigue and weaknessWeight loss and malnutritionThank you for taking the time to read just a fraction of Danielle’s story.,875,2500,40,35,10,4,6
The Caris Family&#x2665;&#xFE0F;,https://www.gofundme.com/the-caris-family,9,CANTON,OH,"My name is Kayla Shedlock and I’m reaching out to anyone that is willing to give a helping hand.  My little sister Sarah Caris is 26 years old with a loving husband and two beautiful children. She has been silently battling chronic pain since she was a teenager. Without losing hope from going in and out of doctor appointments with no diagnosis  her husband Mitchell  spent countless days and nights searching for answers. One night while searching online he found the answers to all my sisters pain and suffering the doctors could not. Sarah was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis in addition to her Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a degenerative form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine when spinal joints become inflamed  causing severe  chronic pain.  After restoring a little hope and relief  they find theirselves back in the same situation. Sarah has been in and out of the ER four times in the last two weeks with new symptoms of paralyzing pain. Doctors acknowledge her pain but send her home with no answers.  Mitchell can't stay home from work due to mandatory \outage\"" which requires 72 hour weeks. They got around that by applying for FMLA. Unfortunately they found out two weeks into it they weren't going to get paid  it only allowed him to take off work without getting fired. So now they're out a significant amount of money which leaves them unable to pay their bills. And he now has to go back to work while he is helpless and terrified he's going to get the call his wife is in the ER again. Not to mention she's not capable of caring for the two children on her own. Sarah and Mitchell have helped so many strangers and loved ones in their time of need  emotionally and financially.  So im hoping this will help pay it forward.  Give them some peace of mind throughout this difficult time and help them regain some much needed hope! Thank you so much for your time and consideration to donate.""",1365,10000,18,14,12,45,6
Save my Home and Disability,https://www.gofundme.com/save-my-home-and-disability,9,PHILADELPHIA,PA,I worked all of my life as a social worker/therapist helping others. I didn't have medical coverage and paid to see my primary care doctor due to weight gain  swelling of my legs and difficulty breathing. I told him that I thought it was my heart...he said that I was too young for such symptoms and diagnosed me with sleep apnea and treated me with a steroid inhaler. Three month's later on my way to work  I couldn't breath and paramedics rushed me to Hahnemann Hospital wher I found out that I actually had Congestive Heart Failure and about 20 lbs of fluid on my lungs. The surgeon said I had a malpractice suite and I didn't pursue it. Three day's later I had open heart surgery with a mechanical aortic implant to keep my heart beating. They found a cyst on my left kidney and a fused cervical  lumbar  thoracic spine that had stenosis  herniated discs  spurs and bulging discs that were disintegrated. After I was put on life support...my employer fired me saying that I was too I'll to work. After a one month stay in the hospital I tried to collect unemployment which I was denied being told to collect I must be healthy enough to work. I then applied for disability and was denied. I am currently on 15 medications  one being blood thinner and must take a blood test once per week for the rest of my life. I say this because one day going to the doctor for my weekly blood drawl....I was hit and run over by a car driving through a red light. I was a walking pedestrian with 5 witnesses and a police vehicle in front of me. The police drove away  followed by the woman that ran me over and then the witnesses drove off leaving me in the middle of the street. I painfully made it to my doctors office and told him what happened and he refused to let me call the police or an ambulance saying his office was closing. I couldn't make this stuff up folks! I took myself on public transportation back to Hannamn Hospital where I was found to have internal bleeding  fractured ribs  a broken right pelvic bone and a broken left metatarsal bone in my left foot. I was then put on welfare for medical and $192.00 in food stamps without any source of income. I retained a cut throat attorney for my disability and after 3 year's I was not approved. I currently obtained a more professional law firm to appeal this decision...due to being on life support I lost a lot of oxygen to my brain causing me permanent short term memory loss and brain damage...I live alone with no source of income and my family is not local and can only do so much for me. Now my mortgage company is trying to for close on my home that I had paid for in full back in 1992  but I took out a home equity mortgage around the same time of my injuries. I only owed $60 000 on my principal and they have now increased it due to legal fees up to one hundred thousand dollars. My disability appeal will take another 12-18 month's. My mental state has declined with memory loss  depression  anxiety and schizophrenia. I am begging for your prayers and generosity at this time. I am embarrassed to even ask for help but I am at my limit. Please help me save my house  health and sanity. Life can change in a minute and I am living proof. God Bless and thank you for taking the time out to read my story and take a walk in my shoes!  Respectfully  James Carunchio,290,1800,3,16,7,208,6
John Tracy&#x2019;s Fight for Life,https://www.gofundme.com/john-tracys-fight-for-life,8,NORRISTOWN,PA,A week ago today  my amazing  loving brother in law John Tracy suffered from an aortic dissection from an aneurysm rupturing in his heart. The Tracy family had already been through an unspeakable tragedy earlier that week and are now showing how powerful family and love can be. My sister Kimberle Tracy has shown the most incredible strength through all of this and they have instilled that same love and courage in their two precious  young daughters. I am beyond words on how our families have come together and am so grateful to say that he defied the odds and pulled through. It is going to be a long journey but when his first words to me (after they took the tubes out) were “Is Kim coming? I love her.” were whispered from his lips  I knew we had our Johnny boy back. ❤️ It is going to be a long  hard journey for John and his family. Any prayers  positive vibes and love would be greatly appreciated. John worked every day so Kim can dedicate herself to their daughters. With the massive bills they are going to have  I am going to start a Go Fund Me so there is one less stress they have to worry about. He is looking at more surgeries  keeping blood clots under control  therapy and more. Any help would be most graciously appreciated while they are facing this scary time. Hug your family and friends! Thank you.,1445,10000,16,14,20,87,6
Help Charlie Beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/zuvfke-help-charlie-beat-cancer,0,JACKSONVILLE,FL,For those of you that know Charlie  you know that he is an extraordinary person.  He brightens up all the rooms he walks into.  He is a great person  father  friend  and everyone's favorite bartender.He recently (10/3/2018) underwent surgery for the second time fighting cancer and is spending days in the hospital post-op.   The first time the cancer was found in his foot and had lots of tissue removed keeping him out of work for quite awhile. This time it was found further up in his leg.  It was originally going to be a 6-7 in. incision but after further analysis more specks in his upper thigh lit up so the incision had to be twice as long.  His quad muscle also had to be cut to get around it and thus it is extremely painful to even move his leg.He is expected to be out of work for at least 4-6 weeks at this point.  With this loss of time at work and that fact that medical expenses are so high combined with the everyday necessities of life  money is getting tighter and tighter.In addition to all of this stress their car was recently totaled  at no fault of their own.  They are now having to take on the struggle of finding a new used car and dealing with the payments that go along with that as well.Charlie is one of the most selfless people I know.   Always willing to talk to anyone or do things for anyone that is in need. Now it's time that we send back some of that thoughtfulness and love and support Charlie and his family.  Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated.  Everything we can do to help and surround them with love is what is most important so they can focus on beating this thing.  Please spread the word. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. #cancersucks,4730,10000,11,47,50,356,6
Help Carol Greenwood beat cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/k9rtrp-help-save-carol,1,Chatham,ON,Please help save my mom(Carol). She is one of the most kind and caring people you will ever meet.  She has always put everyone before her own self.  A loving mother to 5 children  grandmother to 5 grandchildren and aunt to many nieces and nephews. She is a legend in the darting community  who always set up youth leagues here in Chatham-Kent. She kept darts going for the youth for many years after she retired from playing the game herself. I know if she could she would be right there to have more youth leagues  ensuring that the sport lives on with the kids. However earlier this year she was diagnosed with extensive small cell carcinoma  which is a very aggressive cancer. She is currently undergoing Chemotherapy here in Chatham  ON and they are hoping that it will shrink the tumours that are currently in her chest area enough to make her more comfortable to have a better enjoyment of life. There is not much else here in Canada that can be done for this type of cancer and we have been told that there is no current trials here either. Following her 16 weeks of chemo they want to try radiation to the adrenal glands and to the brain to stop it from metastasizing to these areas. However the risk and side effects of this could be very detrimental to her physical well being. This has lead us to look for alternative treatment outside of Canada. With extensive research we have came across alternative treatments and have been in contact with a Dr. from Oasis of Hope in Mexico where they would like to complete multiple treatments (Immunotherapy  hyperthermia  dendritic cell vaccine along with natural foods and a few other therapies)  in conjunction with her current chemotherapy regime.The cost of her treatment in Mexico at the Oasis of Hope  is $27 500 US for the first 20 days at the hospital. $4 500 US for the next 13 weeks of treatment back home followed by 1 more week of hospital stay in Mexico at $9 000 US. This does not include airfare  but does include all testing  food and medication for all 3 parts of the treatment. I am not normally one to ask for help  but I am currently taking time off from work as well as being a full time student and need your help to help my mom.  We believe this is her only chance at fighting this cancer and it would mean the world to all of us  if you could help us  help her. Please help us save our mom.Please donate and/or shareEvery little bit helpsThank you from the bottom of our heartsWebsite showing the Medical Facility in Mexico.  https://www.oasisofhope.com,610,40000,4,2,11,228,6

Lost Home,https://www.gofundme.com/b4txp9-lost-home,2,HILLIARD,OH,As a lot of you guys know I recently moved to LA to pursue my dreams. .I got woke out of my sleep to devastaing news that my mothers house was completely burnt down from a fire. Inside the house was everything she owned including furniture  clothing  and 3 of our beloved dogs that were more like family to us Bella  Milo and Frankie. They all perished in the fire.  I’m so thankful she or my stepdad was not at the house when this occurred. But moving forward I’m so worried about how they will afford to regain anything they lost. My mother and my stepdad are very hardworking people but unfortunately most of their income goes to bills and they have no savings and they also didn’t have any renters insurance at this time. This is just a devastating loss for my family and I’m asking for any help through this rough time.,3145,10000,42,31,70,27,6

A man with a gun jumped out and demanded their phones and wallets. After immediately complying with the demands  the attacker decided to turn and shoot  and then drove away  leaving Hix and Kate in a terrifying bloody aftermath. Luckily  Kate had managed to conceal her phone from the attacker and was able to immediately dial 911. Hix was rushed to the nearest hospital and into surgery.The bullet entered just below his belly button  nicking his colon and severing his iliac vein  before lodging in his leg  where it will remain for the rest of his life. It took an ambulance ride and two surgeries to stabilize his condition. He will need to stay in the hospital for observation for 1-2 weeks  and there will be an additional 2 weeks of at home bed rest.Those of us who are lucky enough to call him friend and family  know that he has the biggest heart and is the most considerate person you will likely ever meet. You also know that if you are considered his friend  you ARE his family as well. He works hard  plays hard  and gives his heart and soul to his music and the people around him.He is also a man of many hats! A musician in several bands at night  and by day; a commercial painter  as well as learning to be an electrician on recreational boats. Unfortunately  none of these hats come with Health Insurance or short term benefit package that will pay him a salary while he is recovering.While Hix would give the shirt off of his back to someone who needs it  he would never ask for it if he needed one. So his family is asking for him. And while saving a life is priceless  there is a cost  and with no insurance to help shoulder the burden  once recovered there will be a very large medical bill for Hix to face.Anything you can spare will help. Thank you for your support and love. Let's get Hix back in his hat and back on stage!If you prefer to donate by cash or check directly to Aaron  there is now an account set up to receive funds directly.

FES Bike for Orville Young,https://www.gofundme.com/fes-bike-for-orville,6,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,As many of you know  over the summer  Elaine & Micheal Young's four year old son  Orville   came down with what seemed to be a typical childhood virus.  They soon found out it wasn’t as innocuous as it first seemed as Orvile had lost use of his right arm and was soon diagnosed with Accute Flaccid Myelitis. Orville has been working hard in both occupational therapy and physical therapy.  While at OT he is able to use an FES (functional electrical stimulation) bike that helps stimulate his muscles while peddling with his arms.   This machine is one of his best chances for recovery.  Unfortunately  the machine that is available to him is adult size and he is only able to use it twice a week.   The hope is to have a machine at home for daily use.  http://m.startribune.com/six-minnesota-kids-suffer-rare-polio-like-disorder/495281011/,16100,16000,19,101,123,396,6
I NEED SURGERY -Suzanne Foster,https://www.gofundme.com/help-me-lose-amp-gain-suzanne-foster,6,NEWBERLIN,WI,My situation is complicated.I am allergic to many healthy foods that I love  but now cannot eat.A lifelong practice of swimming 2 miles/day has been eliminated by the severe asthmatic and allergic reactions that I have to locker room sprays/colognes/chemicals.For a variety of other health reasons  I cannot do typical diets.  Many have made me sicker.  When I tried them I had very atypical and negative health situations arise.These three combined to create an almost impossible situation of being unable to maintain a healthy weight.I am obese.  My BMI is 51.5  which is over double what it should be.My obesity is beginning to take a toll on my body.  The impacts will soon be irreversible. My doctor has been advising me for about  three years to have gastric bypass surgery.  Even though the surgery scares me  the consequences of long-term obesity frighten me even more.  Certainly my life will be cut short.  Additionally  I will have increasingly poorer quality of life  with more and more diseases impacting my health.I would have taken my doctor's  advice and had the surgery except for its cost. My health insurance does not cover bariatric surgery. In order to have this surgery-I need to pay $28  800 upfront- ASAP. I am unable to raise this money on my own or tap into savings because I have worked my entire life in ministry.  It has been an incredibly rewarding career  but the pay has always been low. I have always had to live pay check to pay check. I hate to admit how much my pride has delayed my asking you for help. Never did I think that with a college degree and a graduate degree I would be in this situation. But I am.   It’s a reality of my career path. I have been blessed with a loving family but none who are able to help with this situation. Some are dealing with their own serious health situations.It seems to me that the only way I am going to be able to have this life-extending surgery is to humbly ask for your assistance.  I am quite skilled at helping others but pretty new at requesting help. So asking you to help me raise this $28 800 is a big deal for me. Thanks for listening. Thanks for caring.  God bless you.Heartfelt Appreciation for  your consideration.Prayerfully  Suzanne,700,28800,13,2,7,41,6

Our beloved Anita,https://www.gofundme.com/our-beloved-anita,0,OCEANSIDE,CA,I never thought we’d have to start a GoFundMe but life has a way of throwing curve balls. If nothing else  I hope my Mom’s story can spread some awareness and support to others going through life’s hearthearted times... you’re not alone!It started in early 2016  after what should have been a routine shoulder surgery but ended in catastrophic flat lining in post-op  my beloved Mom  Anita Edman Stoefen  was quickly diagnosed with atypical Parkinson's/Dementia (possible Lewy Bodies) which we believe was the cause of brain trauma. Up until that point  Mom was healthy as a horse and EXTREMELY strong for her age. To anyone who knew her  this diagnosis just didn't match up  especially coming from her strong gene pool and no family history of neurological illness -- My Mom was full of life  strength  independence  creativity  and love for all. She worked for the City of Solana Beach until her rapidly progressing ailment disabled her from doing so. She was 69 years old and planned on working until the day she died. Mom LOVED to work  play tennis (as she was a former pro)  and most of all - ART! She created larger than life sculptures and abstract art out of metal scrap  auto parts  and junkyard treasures. She found beauty in things that most people would view as valueless. Mom always viewed health as #1 and took amazing care of her body throughout her life. She was the eldest of 6 children and spent her life taking care of others  including my sisters and I as a single parent. (Yes  Anita sculpted those pigs)During the time of her surgery  Mom was living with my Grandma in Encinitas  until Grandma suddenly died of a stroke at the age of 92  in perfect health and sound of mind. In fact she did yoga that very morning. Grandma also acted as a caretaker to my Mom after her horrific shoulder surgery. We were left heart broken and in desperate need of help taking care of Mom who could not live alone and needed around the clock care and watching over her declining physical/mental state. As My sisters and I have to work full time in order to support ourselves and Mom  we compiled our family's savings and moved her into an assisted living community in Oceanside  Ca (in hopes that it would provide her the care and support she required).Over the course of the past two years  we have depleted savings for Mom's care and have been denied any help from MediCal and social security for reasons out of our control. Our Mom has had unforeseen debts  emergencies  falls  and medical bills that we are struggling to afford and continue to grow.Our beautiful Anita is only 71 and continues to decline physically and mentally  but she never ceases to amaze us with her big heart  generous spirit  and contagious smile. Although her health  hobbies  and independence were taken away from her  she now finds simple joy in spending time with her daughters and boyfriend Lester whom she met at her Care community.My sisters and I are struggling deeply to cover Mom's care and bills. Our goal is to keep her comfortable during her short remaining time with us. Anything helps and we are forever grateful for the support! LOVE  that's why we're here.If you have any questions for us or want to plan a visit to see Anita  please contact Liberty Keeler-Edman.,16780,50000,40,34,106,50,6

Help Save Me From My Teeth,https://www.gofundme.com/681ctco,7,RENO,NV,Hello  my name is Tabitha. I’m a young mother with a little boy  Silas who just turned 3. I work at a front desk of a hotel in Reno. On October 4th 2010 my life changed forever when my mother took her own life. After that tragic event I took a turn for the worse and struggled for many years with depression. During that depression  I took terrible care of my teeth... when I turned 20 I had Silas my life changed for the better. And I got better and started taking better care of myself. Unfortunately it was too late for my teeth. They slowly got worse from there. Now at age 23 I find myself in need for at least 2 root canals and multiple fillings as well as my wisdom teeth pulled. And with horrible dental insurance and  as a hard working mom trying to pay the bills  there’s no way I can afford to make the pain go away. The pain is so intense I can hardly get out of bed. It has got so bad it’s affecting the time I spend with my son. I can’t afford to end the paid but maybe someone kind souls that are in the world can. Please help me put an end to the pain and save me from my teeth.,405,2000,19,20,6,20,6
We Believe In Steve,https://www.gofundme.com/we-believe-in-steve,6,LEWISTON,ME,On March 7th  2016  Linda came home from working at Sandcastle Clinical to find Steve in severe pain. This led to his first surgery on March 9th  2016 for acute necrotizing pancreatitis and the beginning of the life threatening journey he has been on since  which now includes 15 surgical procedures done on his abdomen  7 of which were seriously complicated  5 plus hour surgeries.When Steve had his first surgery for acute necrotizing pancreatitis over two years ago  they removed all of his large intestines except for the sigmoid colon  and more than half his pancreas. This is where his initial ostomy was located and from which the majority of issues are stemming. Since his surgery in January of 2018  where they reconstructed his whole abdominal wall and reconnected his sigmoid to his bowels  he has had one complication after another.Currently  what he has left for a large intestine (which is a very small amount) has now completely stopped working on its own  and is now considered a Chronic Colonic Ileus; it is so swollen and damaged that it doesn't work anymore. In the last month  he has had several operations and procedures to get it working naturally again as well as try to contain the persistent infection. Unfortunately  none of this has helped nor changed the illness and his most recent surgery wound is not healing properly.  Steve can no longer have any food orally and can only sip liquids as needed to take medications. He is now completely reliant on nutrition through an IV port. He is also still battling a very serious abdominal infection and no longer responds to regular antibiotics.  Through mid-November  he’ll need daily infusion therapy at CMMC with one of the strongest antibiotics available and IV nutrition only. This has become a chronic very dangerous illness for him; his health care team has no idea on how long this may last or if they will be able to resolve it at all. Doctors and specialists all agree that any further surgeries at this point should be avoided  as the risks far outweigh the course of treatment. As you can probably guess  this has taken a serious toll on Steve not only physically but mentally as well. And of course  it’s taking a toll on his entire family. Linda hasn’t worked for months as she now is a full time caregiver and must be at his side at all times.From Linda’s recent Facebook post  “we are forever grateful for all the support and prayers you have been giving us and ask once again to keep praying and sending the positive vibes as we need them now just as much as we did when he was first in ICU fighting for his life. He is fighting hard once again  but it has become harder and harder on his body as this has gone on (and it is) more challenging for his surgeons and other doctors. We were told yesterday what he is going through is rare and beyond complicated to … fix”. It’s highly probable Steve will likely never work again.  Linda is out of work for an indefinite amount of time.  Medical insurances have changed requiring substantial co-pay for his dozens of medications and treatments.  Most of us are one health crisis away from losing everything we work so hard for—that’s where Steve and Linda are at.  They desperately need our help. Steve and Linda are AMAZING  people—who have helped a lot of other people—can you help them now?  Any amount you can give is OK—it all adds up to meet the needs.  Please consider helping Linda and Steve.,1846,3000,16,62,36,157,6
Med4OurWorld 2019 Mission Funding,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-mission-funding,7,NEWPORTBEACH,CA,Each year  Med4OurWorld travels to Tavueni  Fiji for two weeks to provide gynecological and surgical care to hundreds of women. This year  I am lucky enough to be joining their team for one week  assisting physicians and other healthcare professionals in their roles. This is a truly amazing opportunity both for my education as a medical student  but more importantly to use my medical knowledge (albeit small) to improve the lives of hundreds of Fijian women. In 2017  on their mission trip  Med4OurWorld saw over 100 patients  completed over 30 surgical procedures  and helped to renovate on-site housing for medical staff.  Additionally  each year  they strive to educate the permanent staff at the clinic  ensuring that the support of the organization lasts longer than the two week trip. As a participant on this trip  I have to fully fund my accommodations  flights  and food. As a result  I am asking you  friends & family  to help me help the women of Fiji! Any donation helps me in my goal  and of course any extra funds will be donated directly to Med4OurWorld. If you're interested in learning more about the organization and previous missions  check out the website here .  Additionally  Med4OurWorld is partnered with the Loloma Foundation  an organization striving to support medical and dental systems throughout the South Pacific. Their website is linked here . Any questions about my trip or donations  please reach out. Thank you so much for your time!Best Anna Cardall  MS1,3454,3454,17,100,17,66,6
Help Me Complete My Bucket List,https://www.gofundme.com/complete-my-bucketlist,0,BOTHELL,WA,"WHO I AM: Hello  my name is Marcello Krakoff  and I'm a 47 year old father of 4 from North Hollywood  California. I'm a former professional child actor and adult actor  I'm a former professional tattoo artist  and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran To get right to the point and to be quite blunt - my health is very bad and I'm dying. My time left on this planet is short and I am here asking for help to travel to as many places in the world as I can during my last time here on earth.  I want to go as many places as I can but my main places I'd like to visit is Europe  especially Norway to see the Northern Lights  and my top desired destination is Israel  especially Jerusalem. WHAT HAPPENED: Here is my story and it's not for the faint of heart - pun slightly intended. While visiting Vietnam in May of this year (2018)  I suffered a major coronary/health incident while in the lobby of my hotel in Hanoi. After breakfast on May 21st  I felt a horrible and painful spasm in my chest and dropped to my knees. INITIAL DIAGNOSIS: At the first hospital in Hanoi  Vietnam I was diagnosed with e-coli  pneumonia  sepsis  an enlarged heart  and a regurgitating (leaking) aortic valve. I spent 17 days there in the ICU fighting for my life and was not expected to live. But by God's grace and the skilled doctors and nurses He created and put there to help me  I survived against the odds. I was instructed upon my discharge to return immediately to the U.S. for continued care and a more thorough follow up testing and evaluation process. FOLLOW UP: Upon my return to the U.S. I went to Seattle  Washington where my mom lives. It is also home to some of the best doctors and hospitals in the country.  I went to the Emergency Room at Evergreen Medical Center in Kirkland  Washington because I was still having chest pain and labored breathing. I was then transferred by ambulance and admitted to the Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue  Washington. FURTHER TESTING DIAGNOSIS; It seems that the doctors in Vietnam missed something...something very major. Upon further testing I was additionally diagnosed with a dissected aorta (tearing of the inner layer of the aorta). A dissected aorta kills between 40%-50% of the people it happens to immediately.  Also the regurgitating (leaking) aortic valve was much more severe than thought. My heart basically has to pump twice to do one full pump due to the blood going right back out because the valve won't seal. PROGNOSIS: 2 of the top cardiologists in the U.S. at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle  Washington say that due to my severely regurgitating (leaking) aortic valve  I have about 5 years to live. However  it could be significantly less if the aortic dissection fully tears or bursts first  which it literally could at any moment and that would kill me instantly. REASONS: My reason for this fundraiser is I've always loved traveling and I want to spend my last time on this earth doing what i love. I've been to over 13 countries so far and I'm currently in Siem Reap  Cambodia. I love sharing my travels and videos I make and picture and other stories with my friends and family mostly via Facebook. GOALS; My goal is to raise enough money to keep traveling as much as I can and as many different places as I can until my heart either quits completely or until my condition deteriorates to the point where I cannot travel any longer. It's also to cover any unforseen emergency medical costs I might incur along the way. DETAILED BACKSTORY: I am on Social Security disability and get paid once a month. I have titanium I have in my neck holding 2 of my vertebrae (C5-C6) together. I slipped a disc while working at Office Depot in Burbank  California in 1999. Starting in 2014 I decided to start traveling and seeing the world on a budget - which was actually cheaper than rent in Los Angeles.  On May 21st  2018  I was 11 days into a planned 30 day tour in Vietnam. After having breakfast in my hotel lobby in Hanoi  Vietnam I suddenly felt an incredible pain in my chest that dropped me to my knees and I had to be helped back to my room where I immediately took some Aspirin (as I learned in the military and subsequent CPR training where I hold an advanced healthcare provider certification). I just layed in bed and rested for the remainder of the day  but then continued on with my tour as I had a non-refundable ticket for a boat cruise on Ha Long Bay already booked. I figured I would just rest on the boat as I got better. Unfortunately  I didn't get any better. So 6 days later on May 27th I was still feeling ill and getting worse by the minute  so I reluctantly walked to the local hospital where it was discovered that I had a severe infection of some sort and I was transferred by ambulance to a bigger French run hospital also in Hanoi for more detailed tests. It was there that I was diagnosed with e-coli  pneumonia  sepsis   an enlarged heart  and a severely leaking aortic valve. Any of these by themselves could have killed me  not to mention having them all at once. The doctors were amazed I was alive at all. I then spent the next 17 days in the ICU fighting for my life where at several points the doctors thought I would not live at all and my prognosis was listed as \Unknown\"". The doctors there did an incredible job and saved my life however they failed to detect the extensive tear in the inner layer of my aorta. The doctors in Vietnam told me the best thing would be to return to the U.S. for follow up care because even the doctors in there knew they had limited resources and I could get better and more thorough care in the U.S.  Once back in the U.S. I went to my mom's house in Seattle  Washington and proceeded to see some of the top cardiologists in the world.  They were all in agreement as well that for all intents and purposes  I should be dead. They were also in agreement that I have about 5 years or less to live. I'm currently on 2 very strong blood pressure medicine to help ease the pressure on my torn aorta. SUMMARY: I am a Christian and I absolutely believe that I experienced divine intervention.  I would like to formally thank God and the doctors and nurses that he sent to save my life. I am a very budget-minded traveler who would like to continue to visit beautiful places on this earth and keep traveling as long as my health permits and I'm looking for financial support to continue my adventures. I would appreciate your help in achieving this.  Any consideration would be welcomed and any financial help would be greatly appreciated. I'm also willing to accept tickets for planes  trains  boats  and automobiles. I'm open to personal invitations to visit as I've done it before and can provide impeccable references. Thank you all in advance  and God bless you all . Sincerely  Marcello ☺""",489,2500,34,20,11,15,6

I know myself and many others we grew up with are hating what is going on down in NC and unfortunately Sarah was one of them. Her neighborhood was under water with contaminated flooding water and a lot of damage. I wanted to start this just to help out with some personal things and appliances that are not being covered by FEMA. FEMA didn’t even get close to what was lost and with the holidays coming I thought it would be a big help to her and her family of 6. So if you find it in your heart to help  Thank you all so much.

Anything will help,https://www.gofundme.com/xxz9e3-anything-will-help,5,MONTGOMERY,IL,Hi  my name is Dwayne and I am a 23yr old God fearing musician and new father who has to be mobile in order to see and take care of my family financially. I was just involved in a car accident where a woman (with no insurance) rear ended me tearing my rear bumper up  shattering my rear windshield  and now my trunk is pretty much in my backseat.  That obviously put a cease to my mobility. I’ve been having to work twice as hard to provide and maintain a stable living circumstance for my fiancé and baby boy. When she had to pull out of work during her third trimester  her job told her that they wouldn’t be able to fund her maternity leave and that turned the pressure up.. I’ve been maintaining the best way I can but this has emensely held me back and now I’m starting to fall behind. Everyone knows that when “life” knocks you down  the world still doesn’t stop. It’s become very hard to maintain. The money I raise will go directly into either repairing my car or getting me another one so I can work again and take care of my family efficiently. I know there will be some who wants to help but can’t. I want to let you know that I thank you even for the desire to help. Just pray with us as we try to meet our goal. Thank you!!! ANYTHING WILL HELP!!!!,1425,4000,33,36,22,20,6

Sunday Funday Freak Accident,https://www.gofundme.com/sunday-funday-freak-accident,0,FOLEY,AL,So I'm pretty private when it comes to these things and hate asking for handouts and really didn’t want to do a go fund me page because I have so much pride. But sometimes  you have to put your pride behind you and ask for help. It started with a boat ride on Sunday and I see this swing I want to jump off of into the water. So instead of just being regular I take it up a couple of notches and go higher up. I just held on when my arms and kicked off the tree to swing me outward into the deeper water  well the extra slack below me grabbed ahold of my ankle and body whipped me straight down. I come up out of the water I I knew I broke my ankle. Come to find out my ankle wasn’t broken  no tendons or ligaments were torn but A huge  severe laceration around my whole foot and My heel was degloved. Thank God the rope dropped me or I would have lost my foot right then and there. Easy sailing I thought. No pressure or weight on my foot and i can’t drive for 2 weeks  easy peasy. But no  My life now consist of living in a hyperbaric chamber. Diving for two hours taking a two hour break and then diving for another 2 hours. I live at the hospital 5 days a week. This process consumes my whole day. **A hyperbaric chamber is a compartment capable of high-pressure Oxygenation  used to treat decompression sickness and anaerobic infections.So now we’re trying to save my foot from amputation. In the past two weeks since the accident I’ve had two surgeries. The first was to reconstruct my foot. The second was to help clean up infection that had set in and started to spread around my ankle. HOPEFULLY the skin underneath the infection is healthy and in good shape so we can get this process of recovery up and going. I won’t know the update on that until Tuesday  October 9.My ankle is still in critical condition and Dr. Mathews said I'm not out of the woods just yet. It's a very scary thought to imagine losing your foot.I went from being very active  working out  running  going to the beach  always getting into new adventures  riding my streetbike and living a happy carefree life to being basically bed ridden. Taking meds  vitamins  and pain killers almost on the hour every hour. And watching tv all the time. If you know me  that's not like me at all. I'm never one to stay still. I always have to be doing something. I miss the luxury of the simplicity of life. But at least I can say I haven’t taken life for granted & don’t plan to stop now. I’m a fighter and I will fight with everything I have until this battle is over. So a very dear and close friend of mine told me to put my pride aside and start a go fund me page to allow my friends to help me.So I agreed  the bills won’t stop coming along now with a steady flow of hospital bills and I'm not allowed to work due to always having to have my leg elevated. I'm not one to ask for help at all but here it is guys  anything will definitely help and I would very much appreciate it.,3379,30000,9,11,59,511,6

Lance family recovery fund,https://www.gofundme.com/lance-family-recovery-fund,0,MIDWAY,GA,"Telling our story is one of the hardest things that I have had to do. We are very private people and this is an extremely personal thing to share with strangers. Most of our extended family have not been told our story. I have reached out to every agency in our area to try to get help for our family and they all said that they were out of resources to help. We have three young children ages eight  eight and ten. We are doing our best to provide for them while protecting them from the truth. All they know is that their Daddy had an accident while home alone. Thank you for taking the time to read our story! Any and all donations are greatly appreciated! In the early morning hours on July 15  2018 our lives were forever changed. You see my husband had been holding onto many years worth of stress and pain. Stress and pain that he had kept hidden from almost everyone. In those early morning hours  his pain reached an unbearable level. He could not fight it anymore  so he tried to end it all. However  the good Lord was watching over him and saved his life. I am grateful beyond words for this blessing! After his \accident\""  he spent 18 days in the hospital. Once released from the hospital he has had several office visits with different doctors. This past week he had another surgery spending another night in the hospital. He has a very long road of recovery ahead and possibly more surgeries. Even his doctors don't know how long his recovery will take. Before his \""accident\""  he was the sole provider for our family. He is now unable to work. The insurance company that he had purchased short term and long term disability through has denied his claim because of the circumstances. I have not been able to go to work because I've been caring for him and taking him to and from his many appointments. We've gotten through these past months with the help and support of family. Now we are asking for your help. We just need enough to cover the costs of health insurance  monthly bills  medications  copays  and gas to get back and forth to appointments until either his disability is approved or he's well enough for me to go to work. Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts! May God bless you all!""",1010,10000,11,10,13,94,6

The Lichty&apos;s,https://www.gofundme.com/the-lichty039s,1,ONEILL,NE,"Terri Clark once said \When someone has cancer  the whole family and everyone who loves them does  too.\""After years [literally] of thinking about starting a GoFundMe  I am finally doing it.  This is ALL for my parents.  They've supported us kids  their family  and the community as much as they've been able to thus far.  I wanted to be able to help them out but considering I'm in college  I needed some other help.  Read the story below.  This isn't a pity story; it's the facts.  Our family has been through more than I could have ever imagined and unfortunately  nothing is free.  Because of my parents raising us (Marissa  Heath  and I) with a faith based foundation  God has been the only way to get through this.  I'm thankful for my parents and their passion in wanting us to learn about religion.Their story:In May of 2016  Jolene was diagnosed with Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer.  She endured 2 months of oral chemotherapy  which shrunk the softball size tumor.  On October 10  2016  she had surgery.  This 4 1/2 hour surgery removed the cancer  29 lymph nodes  the spleen  gull bladder  and 75% of the pancreas.  14 days later  Jolene was cancer free.In the meantime  Kevin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February of 2017.  He had a successful surgery in April of 2017.  They removed his prostate and the cancer;  He and mom were both cancer free now!I couldn't fathom that both of my parents had cancer.  Little did I know this was only the beginning.Come one year later in July of 2018  cancer was found active in Jolene's body again.  The doctors found some spots on her liver  vertebrates  and other lymph nodes in the area.  She now has Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer metastatic stage 4.  As of November 2018  she has done 4 rounds of oral chemotherapy.  She will have 2 more rounds after this one for a total of 6 this time.  In Decemberish the doctor's will re-examine the spots.  However  at this point  my mom will never be cancer free.August 2018 brought surgery for Jolene to remove her thyroid.  This wasn't cancer related  but just another medical expense to add to.  In addition  it slowed down the process to begin chemo for her too.It's October of 2018 and not only does my mom have cancer for the second time  but we found out my dad has it again too.  This time it is lung cancer.  The plan is to remove the cancer node in surgery on November 16  2018---this Friday.  He will be in the hospital for 4-7 days afterwards depending on how the lung recovers.God has been with us through it all.  It's been quite a journey  but I'm confident He gives His hardest battles to His strongest warriors.  We are forever grateful for the community of O'Neill and our family and friends.  God has a plan.  Please consider helping my parents out.  You can help them by praying for our family or by donating through this site.  My hope is this will take some stress off them  so they can focus on their health  jobs  themselves  etc.God bless you all.""",5091,7500,8,68,50,536,5

We are both 38 yrs old.  We are both very  positive and strong-willed.  We are easy to get along with.  Unfortunately we were both recently diagnosed with cancer Danny with testicular cancer and myself with Stage 3 Breast cancer.  As of now  Danny has had surgery performed and doctors have identified a mass behind his stomach wall which is as big as a watermelon. As testing continues  cancer stage or metastasis is unknown.  As for myself   my testing has been delayed as I don't have medical insurance at the moment.  My breast cancer has spread into my lymph nodes under my arm. I am waiting on response from insurance to begin any exams and further treatments. We are raising two beautiful girls  Amber and Aubree.  Danny and I are both fighters. We will both knock this out for ourselves and our family.Our circumstances are very difficult at the moment.  We are both unemployed and I'm not able to search for a job because I am his primary caregiver.  Our transportation is not liable  we rely on family and friends.  We are in dire need therefore we are asking for your help.Money raised will be utilized for both our continued treatments. Danny's insurance does not cover his medications. Medications for myself  are only over the counter which really don't help my pain.The Garza family thanks all of you in advance for your consideration to our needs at this time and truly will appreciate any donations from each and everyone of you. Much love The Garza Family,4870,10000,7,49,78,1000,6
Todd&apos;s Knee Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/todd039s-knee-surgery,0,KYLE,TX,"In Summer 2016 shortly after we lost our son Marshall  my dad (Todd) was laid off from his job as GM of a water tank company. Never to be deterred  he decided the best thing he could do was go back to work for himself. He decided to start his \handy man\"" business back up. With a new degree in hand (and a backpack full of student load debt) Dad hit the ground running with lots of new technology and online outlets for landing jobs  he's worked hard to make sure that he and my mom have been able to keep up with the financial demands of day to day life. Being self employed often times can be feast or famine  as many may know personally. Todd is not the young man he used to be anymore. In September  while working at a client's house  he stepped through a ladder and hurt his knee. Being Todd  he tried to brush it off but the pain wouldn't go away and my mom wouldn't leave him alone so eventually he went to the doctor. Dad had torn his meniscus. The doctor told him he needed to have surgery to repair his knee and it needed to happen before the end of the year. On top of the monthly bills  gas  groceries  and student loans from the degree he earned while he was working  he also has to pay for their health insurance completely out of pocket  along with the deductibles. The surgery is going to cost him quite a bit out of pocket and he's going to miss about two weeks worth of work. By helping us complete this small fundraising campaign  you can keep this man off the streets (while he's supposed to be recovering). If he doesn't make enough money to take two weeks off he'll be back on a ladder the day after his surgery  I promise. He has always worked hard to make sure that my sister  my mom  and I have what we need and now is no exception. I'd like to see him have some time to recover from this surgery. I like to see him have a few days not to panic while he cant work. Please help me help my dad! I'm trying to raise $5 000 because that will cover his part of the surgery and his two weeks that he needs to recover. His surgery is set for Nov. 19 and he'll be off for the two weeks after that. I appreciate everyone taking the time to read this and donating whatever they wish  small amounts add up!""",535,5000,13,11,9,52,6

Help for Kyles family,https://www.gofundme.com/eesjvd-help-for-kyles-family,5,CARLSBAD,CA,Hello everyone As most of you know  Cinnamon and Alex's son  Kyle Ramer  was in a horrific accident on Wednesday night when he was hit on his dirt bike by an SUV going 60 mph.  He has suffered extensive injuries but he is alive and now in the healing process.  You can read the actual story of what happened below  straight from Cinnamon  but for now we have started a campaign for those of you that have asked how you can help the Ramer family.  We want Cinnamon and Alex to focus the next few months on being there for their son  not about money lost from missing work.  We want to help with the medical bills that are accumulating due to multiple surgeries  ICU expenses  physical therapy  potentially very long hospital stay while Kyle is healing  and several months of recovery.   Any amount you would like to give is so appreciated  and of course  no gift is too small for Kyle!Here is the latest update from Cinnamon as of yesterday  October 5th: Hi everyone. First off  Kyle is ok and recovering.I just wanted to let everyone know that we are reading everyone’s posts and messages and am so grateful for each and every one of you. I have been absolutely exhausted and haven’t had the strength to do a post about what has happened. But I know so many people are concerned  and sending love and prayers...thank youWednesday evening 10/3  right around dusk Kyle was riding his dirt bike like he has hundreds of times before  and I guess made the decision to go across the highway (hwy 458)  we don’t know the full details of how the accident happened  but he was struck presumably crossing the highway  by an SUV going most likely 55mph or greater. He flew up  hit the windshield and then was possibly thrown or tumbled down the highway until he came to a stop facedown on the road. He was wearing a helmet  but at some point it flew off. The police found it about 20 yds away from him  cracked and with the chin strap still buckled. I did not hear the accident  but intuitively looked out the window and saw a car stopped in the highway and knew something was wrong. I ran outside across the field and saw him from a distance laying lifeless in the road. As I was running  I was screaming to God to not let him be dead. When I got to him he was unconscious  but his eyes were slightly open. As I called his name he started moaning so I knew he was still alive. He was bleeding from his back area into the road  had two giant areas of swelling above his right eye  and the back of his head. His leg was twisted slightly awkwardly. As he started coming to he began crying out in pain. As I waited for help to arrive all I could do was beg God  angels  loved ones to be with him and heal him... save him. I was absolutely hysterical  and went into complete shock so much so that I could not recall anyone’s phone numbers to call to let anyone know what had happened. I did not have my phone on me  so I was grabbing bystanders phones. I was dialing the wrong numbers as my mind was trying to grasp what was happening. Eventually I did dial Alex‘s number and get a hold of him  he was out of town for work. I was also able to remember Kalins number and called him. After that I just dropped down put my hands over him and called upon every healing energy I could pull down to him. The ambulance arrived after what seemed like an eternity  loaded him and we went to children’s mercy. Life flight was not running due to wind. It was the worst thing I can imagine happening and it did. I cannot believe he is alive.After all his trauma assessments  he has a fractured skull in two places  a contusion (brain bleed) on his right temporal lobe  huge puncture wound on his upper buttocks (thank goodness this wasn’t into an organ or lung)  all the muscles in the same upper buttocks cheek were ripped from the bone creating an open pocket under the skin  fractured pelvis  broken femur on right leg  Broken left ankle  and road rash all over his body. But considering he was pummeled by a huge car at that speed  his injuries  while very serious  were surprisingly less than they could have been.Today Kyle is critical but stable in the ICU at Children’s Mercy. We do not think he has permanent brain damage or additional swelling at this time  but he is heavily medicated for his immense amount of pain so it is hard to have a clear knowing. He does respond to commands appropriately and remembers names at random  but took a huge trauma to his head so he’s still recovering. They haven’t cleared his neck/spine out of precaution  and will most likely do an MRI today to look for any injury that might be present. The X-rays look good  so hopefully there is no injury  but it is not worth taking a chance so they are being VERY cautious to clear him. They also have not been able to have a full conversation with him to assess any pain he might be having in his neck. He is wearing a neck brace which seems to be very uncomfortable and he has tried numerous times to pull it off. He had surgery yesterday to repair his broken femur and it went really well. He has a particularly complicated surgery scheduled Monday for his ankle  we need prayers that this will go well and he retains full blood flow to his foot before and after surgery. He hopefully will be cleared by the neuro team today to move out of ICU to a regular room. He is currently hooked up to tubes and wires  has bandages all over his body  has a wrapped leg to support his ankle  and is trying to rest. He is incredibly itchy so they are trying to get that calmed down for him because he keeps pulling off his bandages.Overall  they all believe he will recover fully with some time. Everyone continues to tell us how lucky he is  and that they have seen a lot less injury with a lot worse outcomes. We are truly blessed to still have him with us  and not only have him with us  but to have him with us in such little damage considering what he went through. He has The strongest fighter spirit I have ever witnessed  and I am amazed at his will to survive this accident. Again we appreciate all of you  and keep the prayers coming. And we will update as we can. Much love to you all  ❤️,9690,50000,9,19,67,634,6

Harry and Susan flood recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/harry-and-susan-flood-recovery,2,CABOT,VT,"Hello friends and family.  This is Traci (Thompson) Leibowitz.  My mother and step-father  Susan and Harry MacLaughlin  have been displaced by Hurricane Florence  their home destroyed by flooding.  They did not have flood insurance as they live 45 minutes from the coast in Wallace  NC and never thought they would be affected in this way by a hurricane.  They are undergoing a near total reconstruction of their home and will be without a place to call home for the next 5-6 months.  Here is a letter from Harry about their situation:\On Thursday  September 13  2018 Susan MacLaughlin and I evacuated from our home in Wallace  NC in advance of the landfall of Hurricane Florence.  We stayed with relatives in western South Carolina until Tuesday the 18th when Susan went to Vermont to stay with her daughter  Traci  and I returned to Wallace the next day  September 19th.Upon arrival in Wallace around 4:30 PM on the 19th  I attempted to drive to our home  but was unable to get there as the roads were still flooded with too much water.  I went to a friend’s house in another part of the community which is not flooded.  On September 20th  at about 10 AM  my friend and I used two kayaks to paddle to my home in Wallace  NC.  Upon arriving  the water level at the home was still about 10” deep at the driveway entrance to the garage  but the majority of the water had receded from inside the first floor of the house itself.I entered the home through the front door and was shocked at the degree of devastation.  From looking at the water marks  the level in the first floor had reached about 3 feet.  Everything at three feet or lower is destroyed and very likely not salvageable. I encountered waterlogged furniture which had floated to all sorts of different locations.  Rugs were waterlogged  cabinetry was swollen shut and would not open.  Interior doors were swollen and splitting apart. End tables  TV tables  coffee tables  dining tables and chairs  ottomans  footstools  casual chairs  decorative pieces  file cabinets and desks  book shelves  and more were all water damaged and appear to be unusable.  Particularly notable  the entire refrigerator had toppled over and was lying on the kitchen floor.  The water marks were clearly visible at the 3 foot level on all of the interior walls; all of the baseboard molding was warped and pulling away from the walls; the sheetrock was wet and swollen with paint beginning to peel away.  The water level at 3 feet was above the level of all of the electrical outlets which will require repair and inspection before electricity can be turned back on.  The house has hardwood flooring which was still covered with about ½ - 1 inch of water and the boards were beginning to warp and twist.  All of the appliances (except for the over counter microwave) were flooded and ruined; including: clothes washer and dryer; dishwasher; gas range/oven; refrigerator/freezer; garbage disposal; gas fireplace; gas water heater; TV cable box  DVD player and Sound System.The garage was no better off.  The gas water heater was flooded; a workbench and several electric power tools destroyed; all potted plants which we had moved into the garage were ruined; golf clubs and carts were flooded.  Finally  and not least  our new car (2018 Subaru Impreza) was flooded to the roofline and is a total loss.Moving forward  we do not have flood insurance to cover any of these losses  so all expenses will be out of pocket.  We have applied to FEMA but are unsure of what may be covered.  We have contacted SERVPRO to handle the cleanup and mold remediation/prevention and are hopeful that may begin soon.  After that cleanup is completed  the house will be ready for the rebuilding efforts  but we are anticipating difficulty with that due to the high demand in the area from the multitudes of people in the same situation as us.It’s now been 2 weeks since we arrived back home after the hurricane.  All of the furniture  appliances  lower cabinets  flooring and bottom 4 feet of sheetrock have been demolished and removed.  One of the pictures I’ve attached shows the interior as of last Monday.  It looks even cleaner (and emptier) today.  In a nutshell  we lost everything on the first floor. The interior is in the final stages of being dried out using dehumidifiers and fans  after which the entire inside will be chemically treated to prevent the spread of any mold. While our remediation contractor did all this work  Susan and I spent a lot of time laundering whatever we thought could be salvaged (we forgot how depressing public Laundromats can be!) including clothing  linens  rugs  etc.  We also were able to save important papers and files by carefully drying them sheet by sheet.  To retrieve dishes  tablecloths  platters  glassware etc. from the lower sections of our furniture  we had to literally demolish the cabinet doors and drawers to get them open (swollen by the water).  Most of the stuff saved was moved to the second floor where we had a dehumidifier running from the start.As soon as the property is dried out  treated and certified clean  the reconstruction can begin  probably within several days.  We are committed with our original builder which gives us confidence  as he still has all of the original plans and records including details of the cabinetry  flooring and appliances.  He also built our neighbor’s house across-the-street  so we’ll benefit from the economies of joining materials  laborers and supervision. We’re supposed to have his estimate tomorrow; and we’re expecting it to be 6 figures.  We plan to take a break tomorrow and then we’ll begin to start looking at furniture replacements  etc.We have learned that it will take 5-6 months before we are able to move back into our home.  While the rebuilding is taking place  the hands-on work demanded of us will slow down.  We are exploring options to figure out where we will live during that time.\""  Other info about this campaign:  Funds raised here will be used by my mom and Harry to cover some of the costs of replacing the kitchen appliances - refridgerator  oven  stove top range  dishwasher - all of which were lost due to water damage from flooding.   I have organized this campaign to benefit my mother  Susan MacLaughlin  and my step-dad  Harry MacLaughlin.  I live in Vermont and have not been personally affected by the hurricane.  Susan and Harry own a home in Wallace  NC where they live year-round that was badly damaged by Hurricane Florence.  The pictures above are of their home and their neighborhood.  This is their full-time residence  not a second home.  My mom will receive the funds as the sole person able to withdraw from this GoFundMe.""",2490,2500,9,100,27,258,6

Lisa&apos;s Fund -- USC&apos;s Barbaric Human Research Plan,https://www.gofundme.com/fixing-issues-caused-by-doctor,7,LOSANGELES,CA,The world of plastic surgery is a very dangerous place---especially in America. You look at some people and wonder if they went to a doctor without a license. Unfortunately  that is not far from the what actually took place with many patients who came to beverly hills for help with their careers.  Doctors/Surgeons are not perfect---this is a fact. Some make mistakes  others purposely hurt their trusting patients and are saved by the laws that protect that. After you sign the forms  the doctors can do whatever they want to you and if you try to sue; it will take time  effort and the heartbreaking reality that there is no justice if you don't have money to fight. One woman who told her surgeon how excited she was that she finally was on TV and finally got into SAG-Aftra  and wanted the tiniest addition to the bridge of her nose to cure a defect in photographs.... tricked her  put her in a clinical trial for cleft lip and sleep apnea  which means it could be 40 years before her own medical records are released.  This doctor seemed to derive pleasure on tricking her and didn't tell her is he was going to purposefully harm her by letting craniofacial surgeons from Children's Hospital and USC train on her face-- usury of the body--- by waiving her consent and waiving her hippa rights to her own records--the powerful USC injured her by cutting off her upper jaw and degloving her face which has left even daily tasts like eating extremely difficult. I’m here to ask for even a small amount of donations for this woman who went in for a cosmetic augmentation of her nose & left the surgery with not only a different nose than what was consented for  but woke up with her mouth paralyzed and her eyes being much much smaller and an incredible theft of her rights to medical care in the united states. She has worked tirelessly for access to her records  studied lawbooks  done FOIA requests for records  studied human anatomy research to help herself get better.  What she didn't know was this surgeon without conscience let student do government testing on her  which included waking up to a scrape on her cervix and the words i was raped repeated in her head over and over  which though illegal  in california  she cannot get the Beverly Hills Police Department to investigate nor the Medical Board to help.  Sadly  she has sued and been on a crusade to help protect others and is forced to fly out of the country due to USC's cruelty of waiving her rights to care here. This brutality was done to accredit students at USC and Children's Hospital although because she was in a Beverly Hills Clinic  she had no idea was a training facility.  Unfortunately  because her chart is flagged as a clinical trial participant  and her private medical information disseminated across all Hospitals that USC does business with  including her own insurance carrier  Kaiser  she has been denied medical treatment by anyone in these United States. She has spent money on the lawsuit  and surgeries in other countries to reconstruct what was removed without consent as well as remove things that were added without her permission (like the illegal permanent filler Aquamid) which has effected memory and given her mental impairment. This doctor  in cooperation with USC has been doing this for a very long time to many other patients---consenting them to studies they didn't know they were in  ensuring they would be permanently damaged psychologically and physically  then denied any care in the US---all the while refusing to tell the participants what was done to them and withholding the care needed to be repaired. She finally figured outsome of what happened to cause her to be disabled by three experts in three different countries but still is unaware of the long term affects of the Centers for Disease Control testing through USC's sickening bioresearch policy to disable healthy human subjects without remorse.  Cedars specimen boxes were outside Lasky Clinic where she went for surgery.  The point is  it's more than USC--The government is protecting these horrors as necessary to Public Health. Therefore  the injustice might never fully come to light.We need your help to help this young lady and get this monster into jail and raise money to file subpoenas to get her true records. Sorry for the syphyllis is a similar story of our government infecting african american men then withholding care for 40 years. They infected 1500 men and women in guatemala with STD's just to see what would happen. Our department of health is running loose on good Americans and people who fly here for therapeutic plastic surgery as if this were Nazi Germany.  Any amount will help either with the case or the rebuilding of her jaw with her hip bone.,705,15000,30,5,6,11,6

She went from a happy go lucky girl to a person most people who knew and loved her wouldn't recognize. After 8 months of suffering in pain and extreme hardships on Nadia and her family  she was diagnosed with an overgrowth of gut yeast and Encephalopathy a couple of months in. She had to (and still is) undergo an gull gut reset to heal  but the episodes did not subside. After visits to the Mayo Clinic  Hoag medical center and specialist she has been diagnosed with Au CIRS  IBS and multiple pelvic cysts all of which aggravated by her autoimmune and mitochondria disorder. Multitude of Doctor Visits and TestingNadia has been to doctors and specialists spanning four states including the Mayo Clinic.  Although medical insurance has covered all the major tests. There have been many other costs including uncovered testing  specialist visits  travel and more that have left her family under financial and emotional strain.

Help Coach Goldthorpe run again,https://www.gofundme.com/help-coach-goldthorpe-run-again,6,EAGLEMOUNTAIN,UT,RaNell is the mother to five children who adore her and her passion for running came soon after she had her fifth baby. She ran almost everyday sometimes for hours. She has accumulated medals and ribbons and even placed in the top ten for her age group in many 5k races. Her greatest accomplishment while running was having the opportunity to run a ultra. Which consists of a 50mile race. After years of running she became a track and cross country coach and  fell in love with coaching and also with her athletes. She has coached now for 8 years. Although  In June of 2017 she and her family found out that there was a large tumor growing in her right leg. The tumor was inside her bone causing lots of pain. After going to the doctor they found out it was cancerous and is an extremely rare type of bone cancer. There was almost no chance of being able to run again. The doctors performed a surgery they hoped would work  while also giving her a small chance to run again. After coming out of her surgery she barely made it out alive. She needed three blood transfusions and her body was having a hard time accepting the different blood. Thankfully she pulled through. With high hopes of running again the cancer came back a year later. And in September of 2018 she went back into surgery to perform a procedure that eliminated any chance of running again. That was until her husband found what is called a hydroworx. This is a underwater treadmil. Which means because its underwater the pressure of running on normal ground would be almost non-existant and might give her the chance to run again. Because of how expensive these treadmills are and how much her medical expenses cost. I am hoping to raise enough money to buy one of these and a little extra to help with her medical bills. We appreciate any donation and thank you guys in advance. RaNell is my mom and I love her very much. I hope that this can ease some of the burden she is carrying. Thank you all♥️,1000,10000,7,10,10,116,6

Help Richard regain health,https://www.gofundme.com/richard-marleau,6,Gatineau,QC,"This is desperate plea from Bob and Fran  Richard's parents to help him regain some measure of quality of life.Eleven years ago  our beautiful son began feeling pain in his abdomen and back  along with difficulty digesting food. It took many visits to our then family doctor  as well as many  many  visits to hospitals in order to find out what was ailing him. Around 2008 he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. It fairly quickly progressed  causing him to become very thin  not able to get the nutrition needed to maintain healthy bones  losing all his teeth. We saw our son change rapidly from being a strong healthy six foot 2 young man to a disabled 35 year old  not able to work  have a girlfriend and enjoy life.During the first stays in hospital  well meaning gastroenterologists tried several \cutting edge drugs\"" and therapy that only made him sicker. It was clear that this was not going to help. Finally after many examinations  scans  colonoscopies we were told that his entire colon was affected. Not long after that  Richard underwent a major surgery to remove his colon. Now he finds himself with an ileostomy and wearing a bag for the rest of his life. Our hopes of improvement quickly faded  as he was still not able to eat  pass food properly and was in constant pain.Two more surgeries followed  both times to resection his small intestine because of obstructions and scar tissue adhesions. In late June of this year  Richard was re-admitted to hospital as he was still not able to pass any food and was in great pain. We are in October now and none of the problems in his gut were addressed and after more than three months his legs and feet have swollen beyond belief!Our health system with it's \""revolving door\""policy of specialists has failed him. As for his legs  it is well known that the swelling is not caused by fluid retention but rather a blood circulation problem caused by arteries or veins pinched or affected in such a way that prevent proper circulation to his legs. Something has to be done very soon or he will lose his legs. The tissues are dying.My wife and I no longer know where to turn to  as the health system in our province is riddled with bureaucracy and incompetence to deal with his situation. We would like to turn to the private sector or send him to the U.S. to undergo the surgery he needs to regain a little bit better quality of life.We have faith that there are good people in this world that could help us even with just a small gift to help our only son.We would like to thank all of you out there  and may God bless.Que Dieu vous bénissent.""",250,10000,10,3,6,48,6

Journey to new lungs,https://www.gofundme.com/journey-to-new-lungs,0,NAPLES,FL,"My sister was born with Cystic Fibrosis in 1997.  Her life started out with a very long hospital stay in the intensive care unit. She had surgery at a 24 hours old and it put CF center stage in our family ever since.  Throughout her life  she has had many struggles with cystic fibrosis as it is a tenacious disease that is constantly challenging Maddy to stay as healthy as possible. For those of you that don't know  CF is a genetic disease that affects anything in your body that makes mucus or has ducts. Her body's ducts and airways get coated with thick mucus that plugs up enough to cause trouble.  As CF progresses  it has had an effect on many organs in her body such as; liver  kidneys  heart  lungs  pancreas  etc. Partner this with MRSA  she picked up at a hospital years ago - and it has been quite an adventure.  Maddy is constantly battling MRSA along with her CF as MRSA lives in her lungs and will NEVER go away.  It's like fighting at least two battles at the same time as the conditions in her lungs are favorable to the growth of MRSA - it has definitely made itself at home there. So we fight.  CF people are susceptible to things in our environment like burkholderia gladioli  pseudomonas  mold  common germs  etc.  While it may not bother you or me  these are all dangers for Maddy. So we fight.Maddy is now 21 and her current conditions are becoming a long list. We found out we are now fighting; osteoporosis  liver disease  kidney disease  pulmonary hypertension  anemia  hyperthyroidism  sinus disease  CFRD (cystic fibrosis related diabetes) as well as CF and MRSA! To look at my beautiful sister you would never know all of this is going on.  CF is not on the outside - it raises chaos inside. So therefore  is an invisible disease.  We fight the invisible enemies EVERY DAY.Too many hospital visits to count over her 21 years.  Far too many.  One that stands out in all of our minds is the one from December 2013 into January 2014. A Christmas we will never forget.  Very sick and on a ventilator while being induced into a coma. Blood going toxic  CO2 way too high  seizures  a brain bruise and doctors urging us to let her pass.  They forgot that WE FIGHT.  Our parents refused to give up and by some miracle she fought back and showed them all.  Did I mention my sister is a fighter?  AND stubborn as hell.  We have had the opportunity to get Maddy on some fabulous meds  but CF is a monster that will still do what it can to destroy - like an invisible sledge hammer.  MRSA likes to play too  so it's never easy for my sister. Now at 21  she had to leave pediatric care and go into adult care.  That really sucks. She also started her double lung transplant evaluation.  Wow is that hard stuff.  Tests that are pretty common to tests that seem out of a movie! With new doctors come a new perspective. Her lab tests show that all the conditions I mentioned earlier are definitely real and major players.  Her lungs are badly damaged and parts of the left lung are no longer functioning.  She has \blebs\"" (air pockets or cysts) at the top of both lungs taking up quite a bit of room.  Her lung capacity is ab out 30% so if you were to try to breathe through a straw only - it's about like that - try it - it's not easy is it?Recently  she had a lung bleed that scared us all.  It's a reminder that CF never sleeps and her lungs are very fragile. As a CF person gets older their broncial tubes rub on blood vessels causing infections or pneumonias. After coughing up 1/3 cup blood (gross I know) mom had to rush her to Orlando.  She was on IVs there for a few days awaiting decision on whether or not to embolize the bleeding vessel. Luckily it stopped on its own. We won this battle and then home to fight some more.We aren't done with the lung eval testing but should be finishing up most of it next week.  So with all I've told you - she will get listed right?  NO - believe it or not they say she's early.  However since she's had some bleeding (hemoptysis) thing can change quickly... or not... That's the game CF plays.  We wanted to get established so they know her now rather than when it's too late. CF's games are crazy. We stand ready to FIGHT.When we are listed and get the call - the world changes again.  New lungs will need the optimum environment to stay healthy so we learn a new way of taking care of Maddy.  The good news? Her new lungs will not have MRSA or CF.  Bad news - they are fragile too and must be kept happy. And all of the damage done to her body is done.  But we say bye by to CF in her lungs. And she gets to breathe like she has never known!  Why the fundraiser? Well my mom and Maddy go to Orlando all the time for doctors  testing  lung eval stuff.  As things progress and Maddy needs new lungs - a cushion of funds is required. Stupid right?  Yes it is  but we aren't there yet  so when we are I have a feeling they are right. There is a lot involved here.  Family from all over the United States will need to be here to support the family and my parents will miss work.  My mom and Maddy will also need to live closer to Orlando until she recovers  so expenses are going to be there. So I begin this journey to giving them support and peace of mind that funds are available in the future. Make no mistake - CF is a monster of the worst kind.  It is invisible and nasty and takes prisoners.  Not just the person with CF  but all of us that love her.  We all FIGHT. Please join me in helping my family prepare for whatever the future brings.  We love our Maddy so much and so WE FIGHT.Sincerely Maddy's Brother Chance Arthur""",6210,10000,8,62,56,643,6

Now they need our help. As Will continues on his battle to beat Cancer  the bills are starting to pile up.  Co pays  deductibles  medications  treatments  and the expense of everyday life.  It’s becoming extremely overwhelming.  A family should not have to worry if they can pay the light bill or have food to eat when they are facing the horrible monster called Cancer. Will has been a dedicated Firefighter Paramedic for over 15 years.  I am asking any and all who are willing to please help this family.  No family should have to carry this burden alone.  Let us take the watch brother until your battle is complete.,20823,35000,17,59,241,1000,6

Ahora se encuentra en proceso de recuperación postoperatoria  en estado delicado y en puertas una posible segunda operación (en evaluación aún por una posible fisura). Por la situación sociopolítica y económica de Venezuela los costos de la clínica están completamente dolarizados como consecuencia de la hiperinflación y por la condición de mi mamá no la puedo sacar de la clínica ya que está en riesgo su vida en este momento.  Por todo lo anterior  solicito su ayuda de corazón para poder pagar los gastos de la clínica e insumos que se requieran y poder salvar la vida de mi mamá (Dios mediante) y así pueda quedarse hospitalizada los días que necesite  recibiendo el tratamiento médico correspondiente  posteriormente  cuando esté fuera de peligro poder iniciar el tratamiento de quimioterapia  el cual también seguramente tendrá que ser en un centro médico privado por la falta de insumos y medicinas en los hospitales públicos. Lamentablemente este año ha sido una etapa muy difícil y dolorosa a nivel familiar  el 25 de abril de este año  falleció mi papá como consecuencia de una diabetes crónica  la cual provocó falla del riñón que incluyó diálisis  durante todo un largo proceso en Venezuela y por la falta de insumos médicos  esto hizo que se agotaran mis recursos económicos y me pone en la difícil circunstancia de no tener suficientes recursos para afrontar en este momento los gastos médicos que mi madre necesita.

The insurance company is not even helping with living accommodations.  The contractor estimated around $50 000. Travis has been in the process of getting the house ready to sell and this is not going to help. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Not only could he use donations but also will need help cleaning out the mess. Any donations of money or time would be amazing. If you know Travis you know he would never ask for help. He only asks what he can help with. So It would be awesome if we can help him this time. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any help you can give.,850,5000,17,17,10,39,6

Hope for Tiffany,https://www.gofundme.com/5p3kjw-hope-for-tiffany,1,CANTON,OH,Tiffany Green is a daughter  mother  a sister  an aunt  a wife and a very dear friend to many. She has a heart of gold and has spent her life loving and helping others. She and her husband never ask for help  they are always ones to be the first to help others. If at any time they need help  now is that time. I'm going to give a time line for everyone to better understand the situation in hand.  Tiffany was first diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer in June of 2016. She had to go through 8 weeks of daily radition  8 doses of chemo as well as 8 doses of internal radiation. In Sept of 2016  the cancer went into remission. She then found out in Jan 2017  she suffered intestinal damage due to radiation treatment. In March of 2017  her mother was diagnosed with cancer and soon lost her battle in June of 2017. May she RIP. Soon there after in August of 2017  Tiffany had major complications due to her treatments and her colon burst which left her with an ostomy bag. All of which left her Still fatigued and not feeling well. She was then told in March of 2018 that she had more tumors which were removed and said to be non cancerous. In July of 2018  she ran into problems with her bladder which resulted in uterin stints on both sides. Which was very painful  she had infection and was in and out of the hospital. Which brings us up to date. Sept 2018  this horrible monster we have all grown to despise called cancer  came back with a vengeance. There are far too many tumors to operate which leaves the only option being 8 rounds of chemo with a 50% chance of surviving a year. This family needs some help right now. Please find it in your heart to do just that.,330,5000,2,7,10,382,6
Adam&#x2019;s Battle with PSC &amp; Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/adamboyer,9,SYLVANIA,OH,Adam Boyer is a hard working devoted father to two little boys Jake & Sam  and husband to Julie. Adam has lived with PSC for over 20 years and just now got on the transplant list. He is in the top 20 for his blood type. We don't know when he will need his transplant as this disease is unpredictable. My husband Adam was diagnosed in 1998 with a rare liver disease  Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and Crohn's disease  a chronic inflammatory bowel disease  PSC remains an incurable disease that leads to liver failure  and the only current treatment is a liver transplant. If there is any doubt about the seriousness of this disease  know that it took down NFL legend Walter Payton. On the bright side  Chris Klug who received a liver transplant in 2000 went on to become a professional alpine snowboarder who won Bronze at the Olympic Games in 2002 Salt Lake City and Gold at the Winter X Games in 2016 Aspen. However  there is still a chance that the disease will recur and that doesn't include all the risks of continuing to be on immunosuppressive drugs for life which are also very expensive. We have had a tough year on top of being put on the transplant list Adam was laid off from his job. We are thankful he found another job but its not as much pay as we had prior.  We are also thankful that I am able to have my jobs with childcare as well as take care of the boys. However we are barely making ends meet so the extra costs of medical bills and everything that comes with that are difficult for us. The total cost of a living donor transplant is roughly $580 000 or more.  Although insurance will approve this procedure and pay for most it will not cover it all. We are asking for this amount due to what insurance will not cover & living expenses while out of work for a few months. If there is extra it will go towards medication costs.All donations  regardless of the amount  are greatly appreciated and will make a difference. Your support means the world to us. Thank you.Update: They found a tumor In Adam’s bile duct. They did a biopsy and determined that it is cancer. He has been diagnosed with bile duct cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma. The transplant is post poned for now as we fight cancer. The money will now go towards time not working as we go for hospital appointments and any need during this difficult time of fighting this rare cancer. Thank you for your support.,12428,25000,12,50,156,1000,6
Michelle,https://www.gofundme.com/helpmamaworkit,1,NORWALK,CT,If you know Michelle  you know she's one of the hardest working people around. While managing a demanding full-time job  running Work It Dance & Fitness with her husband Tony and battling breast cancer for the 2nd time  she still gives 150% to her students and friends.  Michelle is the first person to drop what she's doing and offer help every time I've needed it and now  it's my turn to do something for her.We all know cancer sucks. Many of you have been touched by it either directly or indirectly. But it's also expensive. Work It has been a labor of love  offering community and fulfillment  but not much in the way of profit. Michelle has bravely chosen to fight cancer HER way which involves an exorbitant amount of out-of-pocket costs. The truth is  I know that she and Tony are working their butts off to afford medications  continuous exams & scans  doctor visits and supplemental treatments. She recently purchased a device that was several thousand dollars because it was proving to be helpful when she went for treatments at a local business that has since closed. When you're fighting cancer  you do what it takes!Michelle is fighting the battle of her life to live and thrive. Those of us who love her don't want her to compromise her health because of cost so please  if you are willing  help us reach our goal. There is no amount too small. After years of giving to this community of dancers  Work It clients and fitness enthusiasts  she would never directly ask us for help. But she surely deserves it. Thank you all -- Work It Warriors  friends  family and community.~Tava,8200,7500,18,109,129,452,6
Baby Wright IVF Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/baby-wright-ivf-journey,8,LAKESTEVENS,WA,We struggled with this idea for a long time thinking that it would appear selfish and embarrassing to ask for help  but this is the kind of journey in life where you need to lean on your village. We are blessed with so many friends and family already reaching out about ways to help whether that be financial  prayers  love or encouragement. So we decided to set this up as a way for those who are able and wanting to help with the financial side of our journey. Any and all forms of support are so appreciated. Tom and I have been trying to have a baby for about 2.5 years. After exhausting all the less invasive options  we are now faced with moving on to IVF as our means of having a baby. We will be proceeding with this stage at Seattle Reproductive Medicine (SRM). My health history has been a tumultuous one. As a high school freshman I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. After medications failed  I was hospitalized for an extended period of time and ended up with numerous surgeries over several years. The surgeries left behind scar tissue which is now believed to be the reason for our infertility issues. Everything else looks good so we are considered to be great candidates for a successful IVF. Tom and I have been saving for this process which will total around $30 000+. It is surely a burden  but the end reward will be great and worthwhile. It is humbling to ask for help  but we deeply appreciate any support that comes our way. I will be documenting and sharing our journey through a blog if anyone wishes to follow along.

Roberta&apos;s Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/roberta039s-cancer-fund,0,TORRINGTON,CT,5 months ago my family's life was changed forever.I'll never forget getting home from an In the Heights rehearsal and not knowing where my mom was. The frantic call from my sister telling me she was in the hospital  and before she even said the word I knew deep down what it was.Stage IV cancer.At first  I felt absolutely hopeless. Here I am  18 years old  about to graduate high school and I was left with a huge dilemma. I wanted to go to college and pursue Musical Theatre  but I could not leave my mom behind. The scary thing about cancer is how unpredictable it is  and I wanted to be here. With this in mind  I decided to take a gap year from going to college so that I could be here for her. These last few months have been the hardest I have ever had to go through. Seeing my mom in pain  seeing her feel so helpless and terrified. Seeing my mother cry is the most heartbreaking sight I have ever had to witness. Here is the strongest woman in my life who has been through it all and is fighting harder than she has ever had to fight before. I have had countless sleepless nights and breakdowns trying to figure out what I can do to help. Everything I do is for my mom  and it will never be enough to ever pay her back for the lessons she has taught me. My mom is my hero. My rock. She has taught me so much and helped me through so many hard times and now it's my turn to help her.Financially  we are seriously struggling. I live with my mom and my sister. My mom cannot work as much as she did because of constant chemo therapy treatments. My sister just gave birth to a beautiful baby and is trying her hardest to provide for us all. I am working a part time job trying to save money for school and a car but at the same time trying to help out as much as I can at home. On top of applying for school again  trying to save up for tuition payments and voice lessons  work  and trying to provide as much support for my family as I can  money is CONSTANTLY weighing my whole family down and the anxiety is unbearable at times. I sometimes feel like there is nothing I can do to help and that I am a bad son. I want to provide for her  but money is the one thing I can't do that would be a huge help.Anything at all would be immensely helpful. It would go towards any bills that come up  gas for the constant back and forth out of town for treatments  and just daily needs that have become a huge burden on us.Am I scared? Absolutely terrified. Life can be really stupidly unfair. If my mom has taught me and my sister anything  it's to just keep pushing  so that's what I want to do. I don't want cancer to be the end of our families happiness. I want to savor every moment  every hug  every kiss  and every breath that I have with my mom without letting cancer stomp on that. My mom Roberta is an incredible mother  grandmother  sister  and friend. We appreciate anything you can do to help our family through this dark time.,2200,5000,12,44,65,431,6
Jeremy Gomes Fundraiser,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-jeremy-and-connie,8,Mississauga,ON,Jeremy Gomes FindraserAs you know Jeremy had an emergency triple bypass in early June.  Since then he has been hospitalized numerous times with serious complications and is currently in hospital continuing the fight.  What some may not know is that Jeremy is a self employed contractor who doesn't have the benefit of short and long term disability that most of us have as a safety net.  This means that he hasn't had an income for the past 6 months.  I've been feeling  a bit helpless until now.  As I considered the impact this lose of income would have to my family it came to me that we can all feel a little less helpless if we can support Jeremy and Connie financially so they can focus on his recovery.   I've set up this Go Fund Me page for any of you who would like to help in a small way.  Thank you for considering a donation to the Jeremy Gomes Fundraiser.,5880,5000,6,118,67,1000,6

Esta campaña es creada con el objetivo de recaudar fondos para una persona de familia  luchadora  especial  querida  una amiga incondicional y sobre todas las cosas una Madre de dos hijos quienes han sido sus motores y sus motivos para continuar en la lucha  haciéndole valientemente frente a esta terrible enfermedad como lo es el CÁNCER.  Este ser tan especial y único de nombre ELYMAR COROMOTO CARABALLO DOMINGUEZ  de 49 años de edad  padece de cáncer desde hace 15 años  el tumor primario estaba ubicado en el paladar blando y fue  denominado ADENO CARCINOMA POLIMORFO DE BAJO GRADO DE MALIGNIDAD  posteriormente haciendo metástasis en los pulmones  huesos y cráneo. En esta oportunidad y por mucho tiempo  Elymar ha recibido diferentes tipos de quimioterapia y radioterapia con el fin de mantener controlada la enfermedad.  Hace unos meses aparece una lesión en la parte occipital del lado derecho de la cabeza  el mismo fue creciendo y de algo que no representaba ni molestia ni malestar empezó a ocasionar dificultad en la visión detectándose estrabismo bilateral. Ya que al realizar un estudio bien exhaustivo de cráneo se encontraron 5 tumores  uno de los cuales estaba ubicado en el nervio óptico y era parte de lo que estaba impidiendo una visión normal. Una vez más fue sometida a tratamiento de radioterapia. Pero el tumor más grande ni se redujo ni tuvo ningún cambio positivo  por el contrario  el mismo se comió el hueso entrando el tumor peligrosamente muy cerca de las meninges lo que significa un alto riesgo en el desarrollo de su calidad de vida ya que la presión sobre toda el área puede ocasionar nuevamente limitaciones visuales  dolores intensos de cabeza y otras secuelas.Pues lo indicado para que  esta guerrera pueda seguir adelante es someterse a una trepanación de cráneo. Debe hacerse lo más pronto posible para que sus facultades neurológicas se mantengan lo más intactas posible. Esta cirugía es de un altísimo costo  y debido a la situación país se nos hace muy cuesta arriba poder sufragar a modus propio el valor de la intervención. Para que esta luchadora pueda seguir adelante con sus ganas de vivir y continuar siendo una guerrera  mucho sabríamos agradecer su colaboración ya que ELYMAR  y sus ganas de vivir son inimaginables. Solo con Dios de su mano  bendiciones para todos..GRACIAS!!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello! This campaign was created with the aim of raising funds for a person with family  fighter  special  darling  an unconditional friend and above all a mother of two children who have been her motors her motives to continue to fight  bravely face this terrible disease as is CANCER. This special and unique being named ELYMAR COROMOTO CARABALLO DOMINGUEZ  49 years old  has been suffering from cancer for about 15 years  the primary tumor was located in the soft palate and was called ADENOC CARMINOMA POLYMORFO LOW DEGREE OF MALIGNITY  subsequently metastasizing to the lungs  bones and skull. On this occasion and for a long time  Elymar has received different types of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to keep the disease under control. A few months ago a lesion appeared on the occipital part of the right side of the head  it was growing and something that did not represent any discomfort or discomfort began to cause difficulty in the vision detecting bilateral strabismus. Because when performing a very thorough study of the skull  5 tumors were found  one of which was located in the optic nerve and was part of what was preventing normal vision. Once again she underwent radiotherapy treatment. But the largest tumor was not reduced or had any positive change  on the contrary  it ate the bone entering the tumor dangerously close to the meninges which means a high risk in the development of their quality of life since the Pressure on the entire area can again cause visual limitations  severe headaches and other sequelae.Well what is indicated so that this warrior can move forward is to undergo a trepanation of the skull. It must be done as soon as possible so that your neurological faculties are kept as intact as possible. This surgery is of a very high cost  and due to the situation in the country  it is very difficult for us to pay for the intervention's value at our own expense. So that this fighter can move forward with her desire to live and continue being a warrior  we would be very grateful for her collaboration since ELYMAR  and her desire to live are unimaginable. Please help us save this amazing woman. May God be with you and blessings for all ..THANK YOU!!!,4354,15000,15,29,57,275,6

Venezolana y maracucha residenciada en Orlando Florida. Tengo 53 años de edad  y hace siete meses fui diagnosticada con Cáncer de Mama grado tres. Casi de inmediato comenzaron las sesiones de quimioterapia  y durante todos estos meses he continuado trabajando arduamente a pesar de los efectos secundarios que todos sabemos comienzan inevitablemente con ese tratamiento. Ahora todo está listo para ir a la siguiente etapa de mi curación  y este lunes 15 de abril de 2019 estaré entrando a quirófano para una Mastectomía Bilateral en el Hospital Orlando Regional Medical Center; es para la etapa posterior a mi cirugía para la cual voy a necesitar de todos los que tengan la posibilidad de ayudarme  ya que mi recuperación depende de mi reposo absoluto durante el post-operatorio  las nuevas quimioterapias  la radioterapia y finalmente la cirugía reconstructiva  todo lo cual me han indicado los médicos durara muchos meses  quizá un año para mi recuperación total y regreso a mi vida normal y al trabajo. Soy una mujer fuerte  trabajadora  alegre y absolutamente agradecida con la vida  que por primera vez me veo en esta situación que afecta mi salud y me impide salir  como lo he hecho siempre  a luchar por mí y por los míos. De antemano agradezco a todo aquel que lleno de bondad se anime a ayudarme a cubrir mis gastos mínimos de subsistencia durante este proceso tan importante para vencer esta enfermedad. Cualquier mínimo aporte  puede ayudarme un día más a recuperarme para seguir luchando por mi vida. Llena de Fe primeramente en Dios nuestro señor y en la humanidad de todos quienes están leyendo mi historia  voy tranquila a quirófano y convencida que voy a poder vencer toda adversidad que se ponga en mí camino.

I am 53 years old  and seven months ago I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer stage three. Almost immediately my chemotherapy sessions began  but nonetheless  during all these months I have continued to work to get a source of income  despite the side effects that we all know inevitably begin with chemotherapy. Now everything is ready to go to the next stage of my healing and this Monday  April 15  2019 I will be entering the operating room for a Bilateral Mastectomy at the Hospital Orlando Regional Medical Center. While I'm in the post-surgery stage  I will be very limited on what I'll be able to do  and therefore won't have any way to work  so I'm reaching out to you all for any possible donations that you may be able to offer  since my absolute rest is crucial for my recovery during the post-operative period which includes the new chemotherapy  radiotherapy and finally reconstructive surgery  all of which the doctors have told me will last many months  maybe a year for my total recovery and return to my normal life and work. I am a strong  hard-working woman  happy and absolutely grateful with life  but for the first time I see myself in this situation that affects my health and prevents me from being able to live my life to the fullest  as I have always done  and to fight for myself and for my friends and family. I'd like to thank in advance anyone who is able to donate anything  no matter how minimal  to help cover my expenses during this important process to overcome this disease. Any minimal contribution can help me make end's meet for one more day to recover and continuing to fight for my life. Full of Faith first in God our Lord and in the humanity of all who are reading my story  I am heading to the operating room calm and convinced that I will be able to overcome all and any adversity that gets in my way. In the name of God amen.,1705,15000,11,11,52,380,19

Help Stephen Beat Lymphoma!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-stephen-win-the-fight,1,VENTURA,CA,Most recent update:We send love to all of our family and friends.  Thank you for your prayers and caring!Last Monday Stephen had a CT Scan and then we saw the doctor.  The results from the CT Scan showed that the past two strong chemos did not seem to do anything.  The tumors have even grown.  The chemo was hard and really knocked him down this time.The good news is that since we are a few days out from the chemo  Stephen is feeling better.  The doctor is considering putting him on a Clinical Trial.So we appreciate your continued prayers.  This past October 3 marked 3 years of this battle.  We have really been sustained through all of this!Thank you to our family who have helped us tremendously during this time!  They have sent sweet gifts in the mail and financial help to help with the parking fees and sometimes the bills!  We love you!  We have a great family! Thank you to our sweet friends who phone at just the right time to give a word of encouragement or visit  who bring dinners by!  Yum!  Stephen is a people person and that cheers him up!Thank you  Thank you  Thank you Love to all Mom (Adria)We are reaching out to post an update as well as ask for prayer & support from those who love and stand with Stephen.We just passed the three-year mark of Stephen's fight against lymphoma (October 3  2015).   He has been sustained through all of the treatments and continues to fight and strong in faith. He is currently undergoing treatment at MD Anderson. He has medical coverage but there are many hospital bills and treatment co-pays that are not covered and have to be paid out of pocket each visit. The plan of treatment puts him at hospital about 3 times per week.  Each round of chemotherapy is approximately $2 000.  There is about $6 500 in medical bills currently outstanding. He has just finished another round of 3 different chemotherapies as well as target radiation. This is a very aggressive form of cancer and we are fighting hard to keep it from spreading and growing.  We don't want him to worry about finances  only to focus on staying strong  fighting hard and getting well.  The doctors have been unable to get him in remission  he needs a miracle!Thank you for spreading the word and standing with us in prayer and support. We look forward to cancer free days and know the best is yet to come!We love and appreciate you all. Psalm 27:13I had fainted  unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.   Wait on the LORD  be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait  I say on the LORD.,2525,12000,16,21,17,69,6
Help for Dwayne,https://www.gofundme.com/yvette-and-dwayne039s-cause,7,STATENISLAND,NY,My name is Yvette Berry.  I am raising funds to take my son  Dwayne Berry to Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland for assessment and psychiatric care.   Dwayne is 30 years old and has Autism Spectrum Disorder (Prior to the age of 22  he was diagnosed as moderately developmentally delayed. I have always felt as a mother that he was autistic.  It was finally confirmed at a psychological evaluation in 2010).   I have been the sole parent caring for Dwayne and I want the best care that Dwayne can receive  which I do not feel that he is getting now.  Dwayne is presently residing in a congregate care facility in Staten Island  NY.  We moved to Staten Island  NY from Brooklyn  NY approximately 7 years ago. I remember thinking that I wanted to get away from Brooklyn’s inadequate care and thinking the care  both medical and otherwise would be better for him over here.  Apparently  since Staten Island  seems to be a borough away from every other borough  it also seems to be limited in the resources for getting good care for an individual with autism.  This realization set in not that very long after we moved here.  There are only 2 hospitals out here  RUMC and Staten Island University Hospital (North and South). I made the very difficult choice to place Dwayne in a residence in Staten Island because his behavior became extremely challenging and very aggressive  in fact  physical and more than I could handle and maintain my job with the City of New York.  So  it became my primary focus to see that Dwayne was placed somewhere suitable for his needs  and again  while I continued working.   I  Thank God that I have an exceptional boss  who I have known for 21 years  and who has actually seen both children   Dwayne and his sister  grow up since they were 9 and 10 years old respectively.  Anyway  Dwayne and I visited several residences before he was accepted at Sharrott House  his present residence.  Of course  there were many transitions issues when Dwayne moved in.  Dwayne tried the patience of the managerial staff as well as Direct Care workers.  However  the coping mechanisms used in this and other group homes is to medicate the individual with aggressive behavior  which is what I really do not like. Behavior management is a secondary thought. Although  there is an Applied Behavioral Specialist  this person is not assigned solely to that house and therefore not available to manage many of the behavioral issues that arise.  The direct care workers are the ones in the frontline.  Prior to coming to Sharrott House  Dwayne was already on several medications such as Risperidone  which caused gynecomastia; Geodon; Thorazine; Haldol (which he is still on  at a lower dosage but still he’s on it); Depakote (which for Dwayne increases his ammonia levels  therefore this really is not the desirable drug for him – The elevated ammonia levels cause Dwayne to practically have to live on Lactulose  which keeps his ammonia levels down by bowel movements throughout the day) Since residing in Sharrott House  he is on so much medication  that I feel it is masking his personality and in fact  I think it is  still causing him to have some sort of psychosis.  Dwayne acts  on one occasion  as if he is a rapper  “Lil Wayne” or sometimes “Drake”  or a WWE wrestler or is traveling to a baseball game in another state with his “rapper friends” and getting on a jet.  At other times  he identifies  a staff member as someone from his time in high school.  He also identifies another consumer as a young man that he was in school with as “Gena”.  The interesting thing is both individuals do resemble the people Dwayne is thinking of.   So  clearly  the anti-psychotic medication is not helping with this situation going on with Dwayne.  I really feel that his real personality is just being locked away in his body.  There has to be a better way. That leads to me why I am fundraising. I do not have sufficient funds to travel with Dwayne to Johns Hopkins University.  I went online and found information on Johns Hopkins website about the John Hopkins Adult Autism and Developmental Disorders Center. I am scheduling time off from my job  using FMLA for an extended period once I have secured the funds to travel and have booked the hotel. I am bringing a close family friend to be a support for me and Dwayne.  Dwayne’s birthday is October 14th.  He will be 30 years old and I know that the time to do something is sooner than later.  I don’t want to live with the regret of what I did not do for him. I want to connect Dwayne with the best care that he can get. I appreciate any help that can be given to us.,1320,7000,10,19,14,106,6
yetistrong,https://www.gofundme.com/yetistrong,8,EASTON,PA,It is with a heavy heart that I am reaching out to all of you for financial assistance.As many of you know  I have been recently diagnosed with 2 forms of CTCL (Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma) an extremely rare cancer.  The 1st is MF (Mycosis Fongoides) and the 2nd is LyP (Lymphomatoid Papulosis) The physicians at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia   PA are providing me with the best course of treatment and care that is available. My prognosis is in question considering the fact that there are so few cases like mine. In saying this  the hours away from my job and the mounting medical expenses are becoming a huge concern for me and my family. No one ever wants to be in a position where they need to ask for financial help but my need for immediate medical attention has brought me to this point. The current plan to begin next week will be 3 weeks of radiation daily  Monday - Friday  1 hour sessions. The radiation therapy will also create another medical concern and financial burden. Once the radiation treatments begin I will become infertile. My wife  Chrissy  and I have been recently married and our plan was to always have a baby. I have a wonderful stepchild and love being a stepfather to her. We have a small window of opportunity for a child by IVF. As we all know  IVF is one of the most costly procedures and is not covered by insurance. In all of this stress and uncertainty  the sunshine in our darkness would be to create a new life...... have a baby! In summary  your financial support will assist me and my family emotionally too! In such a stressful time  your financial gift will bring a huge sense of relief while dealing with so many other concerns that go along with an ongoing illness. Any amount and  will be greatly appreciated. Thank you,4860,10000,22,49,69,170,6

Praying for Amy,https://www.gofundme.com/praying-for-amy,1,BOCARATON,FL,I am writing this for my best friend Amy  who has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. You see  this isn't the first time Amy was diagnosed with cancer. One year ago to the day of this diagnosis  she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She under went a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery and successfully removed the cancer. Shortly after  she was told she would need a hysterectomy. Bravely  she faced that and again successfully completed her treatment.  For the past year Amy has had unexplainable pain in her abdomen and back. After countless doctor visits and tests  no one could diagnose what the cause of her pain was. Frustrated  she persevered supporting her two beautiful daughters and living her life the best she could. Last week  when the pain became unbearable  she went to the hospital. A CT scan was ordered and she was sent home. The next day  the horrible news of stage 4 pancreatic cancer became her reality. Her cancer is not curable and surgery is not an option. Amy has been told without treatment she would not survive past Christmas. Amy is a breast cancer survivor and  a fighter. She is willing to undergo chemo therapy to fight this cancer and to spend as long as possible with the people she loves.Amy has many people who care deeply for her but she needs your help as well.  We are asking you to help Amy fight this horrible disease. Any donation you make will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for all your love and support!,20740,25000,17,83,254,1000,6

Help Breast Cancer Survivor Explant,https://www.gofundme.com/breast-cancer-survivor-help-explant,6,PANAMACITYBEACH,FL,"Hello  my name is Anna.  I'm a breast cancer Survivor  but am now very ill from the silicone implants that were put in for my breast reconstruction. In addition to the illness  I have one implant that has capsular contracture and seems to be stuck to my rib cage and is very hard  the breast is cold and very painful. I need the explant surgery to get these implants out as soon as possible. -I have to be able to go to a good plastic surgeon to get the right operation and not be butchered by some of the plastic surgeons that do not believe in breast implant illness. It is very important that the scar tissue that surrounds the implant  also known as the \capsule\""  is taken out intact at the same time  especially with silicone implants. Also  a lot of plastic surgeons do not know how to do this for a mastectomy patient like myself. This will probably mean I will have to go out of town and incur travel expenses as well.- The picture is from my last reconstruction surgery  with implants in September of 2013 . I had silicone breast implants put in after double mastectomy reconstruction surgery due to breast cancer diagnosis in January 2013. I so wish I could go back to that time and not have had implants put in  maybe reconstruction with fat transfer or flap surgery  if anything. A diagnosis of breast cancer and having a double mastectomy is bad enough  now I have been made even more ill by the reconstruction surgery.- About a year after the final reconstruction surgery  I started feeling tired and my joints were hurting and it was difficult to get to work and even harder to stay awake while I was there. In July of 2016  I was hit with the most horrible fatigue and it has not let up yet. My primary care physician sent me to a rheumatologist in December  they did blood work and found out I have rheumatoid arthritis. - I spend about 23 hours a day in a recliner as I am so very tired  in pain and even taking a shower is a huge undertaking. Before breast cancer I was very active and have worked for 43 years. I lost a great job in January 2017 due to the fatigue and pain. I am now on disability and I'm not eligible for Medicare yet as I have to wait 29 months from the time I was considered disabled by Social Security.  I am certain the silicone breast implants started these health problems  and my left implant seems to be stuck to my rib cage and is very painful. Not everyone has a reaction to breast implants  but it has wreaked havoc on my health.- I am looking to get the implants taken out as soon as possible  as I am becoming more and more ill and I cannot wait any longer. Even if I can get back even 20% of the energy I had before  I could feel like that I am at least alive  as now I feel like I am dying. I'm not expecting the explant to reverse the rheumatoid arthritis I now have  but at least I could have a little energy and could avoid other illnesses that can happen with silicone implants. - Thank you to anyone who can help me with the cost of having these implants taken out  so I can get my life back and start healing again.""",1300,5000,9,26,18,164,6

Josh&apos;s Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/uspw7-josh039s-medical-fund,0,PEYTON,CO,Hello                  I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my step son. This is Josh. He’s a hard-working young man who loves his job. He loves life and loves to hike. He has an uncanny knack for making you smile and laugh even on the worst days. On Wednesday October 3rd  Josh had a medical emergency. After rushing him to the ER it’s never a good feeling when they bring your kid in front of everyone else and rush them back. After waiting with baited breaths to find out what was happening. We were informed that Josh had suffered from something called “A Spontaneous Dissection of His Carotid Artery”. Now I’m no Doctor. So  forgive me if I explain this incorrectly. Truth be told I don’t completely understand it myself.  It’s a situation that can happen typically with people above fifty. As far as I understand nothing causes it. It’s spontaneous. But one of the layers of his Carotid Artery (the Artery you can feel in your neck) split. At which point it leaked blood into another layer. So  when Blood gathers in your neck like this it makes it hard to swallow. Not to mention that blood was supposed to go somewhere. It was really a miracle he didn’t have a stroke. He has been in the hospital for the past couple days. Because they were concerned about a possible stroke  he couldn’t eat or drink  and he was a fall risk. He can finally head home today. Though he will be in bed for a few weeks. A few weeks of not being able to go to work for a young man is very difficult. Especially  to someone who loves his job. He is very concerned about not having money for bills. Or money for these medical bills he has sadly acquired. Now Josh is a bit proud. He doesn’t know this is going around. But I do know Josh  and this would take a lot of stress off his plate so to speak. So  if you can give a bit to help him through this I know he will remember it for the rest of his life. I thank you all for even taking the time to read this. I know money is short for a lot of us. But any little bit helps. Again  from the bottom of my heart thank you for your help.  With Love Jeff,1335,2500,13,53,20,117,6

Accident Fund for Richard Condon,https://www.gofundme.com/accident-fund-for-richard-condon,5,LANSING,MI,Richard Condon  of Millville  NJ was involved in a serious three-car accident on Thursday  October 4  2018 on High Street in Millville  NJ.  While Richard was driving down High Street  a vehicle   which had been stopped at a Stop sign on a side street  pulled onto High Street before traffic had cleared  hitting Richard's car on the driver's side.  Richard sustained serious injuries and was transferred to Cooper University Hospital in Camden where he was in Intensive Care for two days.  His injuries include a concussion  two broken cervical vertebrae  and five broken ribs  to name  the most serious of his injuries.  Because of this accident and the injuries that he sustained  it will be a considerable amount of time before Richard can return to work  if he returns t at all.  Richard's employment at the time of the accident was as an Uber driver.  Richard is 73 years old and he has lost his income and his livelihood.   He receives Social Security income  but the amount he receives couldn't sustain his dog  Corky  for a month.  Social Security has provided Richard with very little  if any  financial security. He has depended on his income as an Uber driver and family assistance to make up the difference.  My brother is a very optimistic person  in his way.  He doesn't whine about his circumstances; he digs in and does anything he is able to do in order to support himself.  It is difficult for me  his sister   to have to observe his struggle from afar (I live in Michigan) rather than to see him able to really enjoy this time of his life.Having to be in such dire financial straits is stressful enough without having this sudden and unforeseen situation thrust upon him.  It is not only this accident that now stands to weigh him down financially.  Richard is not in otherwise good health and has not been for many years.  Despite this  Richard has been a dedicated and hard worker in order to have been able to achieve a very modest standard of living.  That has now been  suddenly and without warning  taken from him.  If Richard is not able to receive some kind of financial assistance  his financial future is very bleak.  Richard is receiving some assistance from immediate family  but it can't stretch far enough to meet his needs  especially under these new circumstances.I am Richard's sister (and his only immediate family) and I am making this URGENT appeal  on his behalf  to any who are ABLE to contribute to this most IMMEDIATE need and most worthy cause.  We will be  eternally  grateful.,1120,3000,18,37,14,48,6
Roberta Fighting Cancer Fundraiser,https://www.gofundme.com/9sjrj-living-by-faith,1,MAURICE,LA,On September 5th  2018 my life changed forever. Thought I would be going to work but instead ended up being taken to 3 different hospitals  2 by ambulance and the last hospital was 2 hours away from my home.All of the test confirmed I had a rare form of head and neck cancer called  Plasma Cytoma. As of the 5th of September I was placed on medical leave.Due to the nature of my cancer and the symptoms it was causing  my oncologist told me that we had to start treatment as soon as possible and to be aggressive. They even started my treatment of radiation before they did a pet scan or bone marrow test.I'm having 28 radiation treatments  I go 5 days a week and am on high dosage of steroids at this time. I am hoping the radiation will shrink this tumor but right now it is just a waiting game. My oncologist told me that I may have to do chemo and or surgery.Radiation causes me to tire out easily and just the symptoms that this cancer causes limits me on what I can do.I am single and only had one income  so now not only do I have cancer to deal with I now worry about how I will pay the medical bills that are already coming in and will continue to come along with my daily living expenses and making sure I can keep my health insurance.For this reason I am starting a go fund me page and asking if you can to please donate  any amount will help. This money will help me pay medical bills and daily living expenses. Thank you so much for your prayers  generosity  and for sharing my story.,1717,3000,10,57,17,131,6
Help Glenn Licursi beat CNS non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,https://www.gofundme.com/glenn-licursi-medical-fund,0,BONITASPRINGS,FL,"My cousin Glenn  who is one of the funniest and most loving people I know  was sadly diagnosed with CNS non-Hodgkin lymphoma on July 27. It all began with two car accidents. Glenn could not understand why he wasn't seeing the things he was hitting. With the help of his wonderful wife  Julia  they realized he had lost vision in his left eye. After being admitted to emergency  he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After further testing  Glenn’s full diagnosis is CNS (central nervous system) non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.Shocked by the diagnosis  they knew they needed to be with family and get the best care they could find. They packed up  left Florida and drove to New York (flying wasn't an option). They were heading to family and the best health care they could find at Sloan Kettering. Thanks to his niece Megan  Glenn was immediately seen at Sloan and set up for treatments.It began with brain surgery to remove a tumor on August 13. He was told it was the size of a lime. On hearing this  Glenn said  \they took the lime out of the coconut.\"" He may be sick  but he still has his sense of humor!Presently  he receives treatment at Sloan in NYC. The treatment began with a series of eight rounds of chemotherapy over a period of 16 weeks. Following that he will be receiving a stem cell transplant which would be a one to two month treatment of in hospital isolation. Julia has been with him staying at the hospital through all his treatments. They have been using their savings  but it is rapidly depleting. The funds from this gofundme campaign will help pay for the expenses incurred during these difficult times and ease Glenn's mind while undergoing his treatment. Because they are in New York  Julia has been unable to work  so there is the added burden of her lost income.  As you can see  it has been difficult for them and if as a group  we can take one burden away from Glenn and Julia  they would be so grateful. If you can donate to the fund that would mean the world  but even if you can't  please keep them in your prayers.Please share on Facebook and Twitter to get the word out.God bless you.""",7573,100000,19,8,54,171,6

Cancer Support for Susan &amp; Jim,https://www.gofundme.com/susanandjim,0,ORLANDO,FL,"In the past year or so some of us had noticed that Susan (my Mom) had changed a bit. She was a little forgetful. Maybe she said the wrong word here and there  but still mostly made sense. She might have spelled something wrong that seemed out of character for her (she is a 4th grade spelling bee champion  after all). She was really tired. A lot. All of these things came to a head in the recent weeks  and Jim lovingly demanded that she go talk to her doctor. Luckily he went along with her to tell the \I'm living with her\"" side  because she became so skilled at protecting us all from knowing that it was hard to even say exactly what the problem was. Susan has a fantastic primary care physician who sent for a head CT  followed by an MRI. When her PCP saw the results he asked that they immediately drive down to the University of Miami hospital to see one of the leading neurosurgeons in the country. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.On October 3rd Mom and Jim made the drive back down to Miami and were informed that their lives were about to change in a way that they never expected: Susan has a Grade IV Glioblastoma. Susan has brain cancer . This is the same cancer that Beau Biden  John McCain  and Ted Kennedy battled. Time is of the essence at this point. Time that can never be made up for.The next step is 6 weeks of radiation at the University of Miami.  This treatment can be brutal with side effects that will prevent Susan from tolerating the 2 hour drive home every day.  The following are some of the expenses Susan and Jim anticipate  just over the next 2 months: $5000 out of pocket insurance deductible $2000 travel fees (rental apartment  gas  tolls  food)$2000 regular monthly expenses (food  mortgage  car payment  etc.)Please consider helping relieve some of the stress Jim and Susan are currently experiencing by donating to their financial needs.

"Please help Danny Bowman pay bills,",https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-danny-bowman-pay-bills,5,HOLLISTER,MO,On Sept.5  2018   Danny fell 30 feet off a ladder with a chainsaw in his hand while trimming a tree in his yard  he was knocked out for at least forty five minutes while bleeding profusely from a 7 inch by 1 inch gash on the back of his head.  When he regained consciousness  he was able to walk in the house and call his sister for help. She called 911 while he walked to the road so they could find him. He did all this with a broken neck (C2}; a broken back (L1); and eight broken ribs. All his sister could do is pray for him to get help while waiting for the ambulance. Her prayers were answered when two County Employees from the Taney County Road and Bridge District  that were also  first responders   just happened to be driving by jumped into action saving his life by holding pressure to his head to help stop the bleeding until the ambulance came.  Danny was in  Neurological ICU at Cox South Hospital ; then moved to a regular room; then spent eighteen days in Shepherd of the Hills Nursing Home for rehab and is now recovering at home and is required to continue to wear his turtle shell body cast and neck brace at all times for several more months. Plus he is raising his five year old Granddaughter  Savannah  whom he is pictured with.  He also has home health in place and is going to require physical therapy for a very long time.  He still might have to have neck or other surgery. He is now 100% disabled at the age of 59. The Neuro Surgeon said it was a miracle that he was alive and not on life support but we know that it is his strong Christian Faith and the Grace of God that kept him alive.Danny  needs to focus all his energy on his recovery   not on worrying about all the medical bills and other expenses that are accumulating. Danny is a lifelong resident of Branson  as he was born and raised here and retired after working as a mechanic at Crawford's Automotive for 33 years. He is a 1977  graduate of Branson High School.Danny is an active member of the First Assembly of God Church in Branson. Danny has never had to ask for help before in his life and hates that he has to now but any help will be gratefully appreciated.,985,10000,5,10,15,281,6

She told me I needed to \pack my shit and go\"" and proceeded to stuff all of my belongings into garbage bags and throw them outside. As much as I didn’t want to do this I called the police to stop her from doing that. To retaliate her and her husband took all of those garbage bags from outside & everything else I had in the kitchen and dumped them into my room then also proceeded to tell me that I’m not allowed to use the kitchen  living room and the bathroom. Ever since then the harassment  intimidation and threats has continued and has made living in this place a living hell.I don't want to live here anymore  I'm stressed out  miserable and fear for my safety the longer this goes on.

Don Parrish Double Lung Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/don-parrish-double-lung-transplant,8,FORTWORTH,TX,I’ve created this page to help my father  Don Parrish  with costs for his upcoming treatment.  He’s battled pulmonary fibrosis for several years and has finally received approval to move forward with the evaluation process to receive a double lung transplant. While this is great news  it comes with many unexpected costs. He’ll have to travel to UT Dallas for his appointments/treatment leading up to the surgery  which is 80 miles away.  After the surgery  he will need housing for 3 months that is near the hospital for everyday appointments/follow up.  During this time  he will need to be under close supervision to ensure his body doesn’t reject the new lungs. This means his girlfriend & family will need to take time off from work to care for him  causing further financial strain. Any donation would help alleviate this burden  and allow Don to focus on his treatment & recovery. We greatly appreciate all the support & love from everyone! Thank you,1960,5000,6,39,19,275,6

This time last year I was working  outoing  vibrant  always laughing joking around. But by New Year's I was having half of my right foot cut off due to Diabetes. After going through the surgery and the therapy a blister forms on the bottom of the same foot I just had surgery on. And due to a doctor's negligence of just ripping the superficial skin off with out using scissors it began to bleed quite a bit. A few weeks later I was having my right leg cut off just below my knee. Now I can't work and bills are piling up. So any donations that you can give will be gladly appreciated.

Ogden Family Hurricane Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/ogden-family-hurricane-recovery,2,WILMINGTON,NC,Ogden Family Displaced by Flood Waters and TornadoAs many of you know  on Thursday  September 14th  Hurricane Florence ripped through Wilmington causing catastrophic damage. The storm also spawned tornados in several places along its path. Unfortunately  one of these places was Jer and Jenn’s home. Although the family had evacuated  Jeremy had driven back before the heavy rains started more flooding. Because there was a leak in the master bedroom  he slept in the kids’ room. Around 10:00 pm his phone beeped a tornado warning. He hid in the interior bathroom and lived to walk out of the house. While he was hiding the tornado took the roof off of the dining area and kids’ room and the high tides started to bring flooding again. The roof landed on their boat and car. After surveying the damage  the family is now displaced from their home for the foreseeable future. They lost their furniture  playground  mower  boat  and house. How You Can HelpAny financial assistance you can provide will help them rebuild a place for their family to live and to buy furniture. Currently the family is moving out any possessions they can salvage and living with a neighbor. As of now  Jer and Jenn do not know if the home will be able to be saved because of the damage. If they are able to rebuild  it would take at least one year from the start of construction. Because of this  they will need to pay for a place to live during this time.Please share the Ogden family’s story and this campaign link with your friends and family. Jon's brother and family are such caring people that always puts others first. Any help will be appreciated by the family. Thank you so much!Jon and Abby Ogden,4811,5000,36,96,51,41,6
David Counceller Stroke Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/david-counceller-stroke-recovery,9,DOUGLAS,AK,On Wednesday October 3rd  our dad  David Counceller had a hemorrhagic stroke. This is when a ruptured blood vessel causes bleeding in the brain. He was medevaced to Indianapolis because the bleeding was not stopping. Fortunately it did eventually stop before brain surgery was necessary.  At this point he is still hospitalized. The stroke has left him with serious speech problems and also impaired use of his right hand.   His recovery is going to be a long haul that includes a lot of speech  occupational  and physical therapy. We are still unsure at this point of how much he will regain from this brain trauma  but we remain optimistic. David Counceller is a wonderful man. He has had a career serving his community as a law enforcement officer and police chief. He is a charismatic person who is used to being on the other side of situations like this... he is a helper  a caring person who has reached out and helped so many in his lifetime. The last thing I want is for my dad to worry about anything right now. I want him to rest and rehabilitate. Donations made to this fund will go to help Dave now  and in the future as he faces recovery from this difficult trauma. Thank you so much.,4715,15000,8,31,64,701,6
Cancer Treatments for Audrey Garro,https://www.gofundme.com/cancer-treatments-for-audrey-garro,1,WOLCOTT,CT,When Cancer strikes  it can often leave those affected shaken and afraid of the path that lies ahead. For Audrey  her path is a well-beaten path that has lead her back and forth from this battle since the age of 17.  Receiving a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma at such an early age and having to undergo radiation and chemotherapy  helped define the person she would grow to be. Her first meaningful job was at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  Years later  she continued to work to raise money for cancer research and cancer patients at the Stamford Hospital.  Audrey moved on to be the Founder of the Carl and Dorothy Bennett Cancer Center’s “The Walk ” now called “Hope in Motion.”Little did she know  the hope she actually put in motion  would be for herself when after major surgery in March of 2017 the doctors diagnosed her with Stage 3 Colorectal Cancer.  Through surgery  recovery and many consultations with Sloan Kettering  the decision was made to undergo chemotherapy yet again to prevent the cancer with a 70% chance or recurrence from returning. Being unable to continue her work in the non-profit sector  she will transition to long-term disability in November. The mental and physical hardships she has endured are only further compounded by the financial burdens that she must now carry to continue her chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  The pharmaceutical component for the medications to aid the treatments are astronomical. Before one of her most recent rounds of radiation  someone asked Audrey “How do you know if it’s working?”  She responded simply by saying  “We don’t…but we have faith and we have science…and we have faith in the caring and competent hospital staff who make the treatment possible.”Please help us make sure the path that lies ahead for Audrey leads to her road to recovery.,23810,20500,27,116,101,173,6

Please pardon me if I was not able to thank you individually - I will catch up this week. Also remember that GoFundMe takes fees so I’m not as close to my goal as I thought. Feel free to use PayPal dvinideas@gmail.com so I get the full amount. Now that the bills are going to be pouring in. On coming Home. Definitely a culture-shock coming home to very little home care support after having a team of what appeared to be hundreds at Cedars. I left in a fog and with a bag with pain medication (one important one missing I find out today Monday. Oy!) Happy to be home with pups and their cuddles are the best. But with the nerve pain meds  every time I moved the wrong way- which was most every move I made. I am going to use some of the money and the balance I need to raise hiring a PT person to help with the chores  so I can focus on my healing  walking and other activities they want me to begin  but have been difficult to date. Friday I see the surgeon and find out definitively what the pathology report reveals and any next steps. Keep me in your prayers for the 5 small but “deadly” slits in my chest heal quickly because I miss taking baths and taking long walks in the rain. Oh. Wait I think I’ve confused my profiles. Anyway  next update on Friday. Much love. MarlaMimi & Leo ######Starship Date 11/27/16 0500- Post-SurgeryWell I’m still here and on the other side of this scary surgery. My left lobe was removed along with some lymph nodes  which is a newer development that points to malignancy. Should now more within a couple of days along with next steps. I’m being well cared for at Cedars Sinai and have manageable pain as long as I don’t move left side of upper body. I want to thank my friends Valeska (for chauffeuring me at the ungodly hour of 4:30 am and did the first shift of waiting)  Mary-Ann for being there when I woke up and staying until I was up and coherent which was many hours later  and my beloved son Josh for being there and his beautiful flowers. The team at Cedars are kind and caring  and make me feel safe. I should be out in a couple of days and will write again when I have more to report. Lastly  THANK YOU donors for your kindness and generosity that helped me have peace of mind leading up to and including these days post-surgery. Xo. M___—————————————————————-I just found out I have a suspicious nodule in my lung in a place that cannot be biopsied. Therefore  I will need surgery to remove it and confirm its pathology. Unfortunately  where it is located also means they will be removing the upper left lobe of my lung. A new development that makes this entire journey much more complicated regardless of the pathology. This is so very hard for me to share because asking for help is not one of my strong suits  I’m usually on the giving not the receiving endBut as a solopreneur who’s already been facing financial challenges  I find myself without any savings to pay all my living expenses (including health insurance which I must keep current) before  during and after my hospital stay. I have a high deductible to meet and I have no idea about any kind of aftercare or in-home support while I’m recovering and beyond if I need I am hoping that if everyone in my community donated a little bit   I can raise enough to face the next few months in preparation for my upcoming surgery  during my hospital stay  aftercare and beyond if needed. I’ve tentatively set a date two months out in order to try to raise the funds I will need to support me on this journey. I am still trying to work but the faster I can raise funds  the sooner I can have the surgery and get all this behind me. Thank you in advance for your generous support and any amount is welcome or if you are financially challenged at this time maybe you can share this fundraiser to help me reach my goal. Of course  I welcome your prayers  love & support and while it is what it is  I’m trying not to overthink or talk too much about this now.I’ve told you all I know for now but promise to keep you updated. Again thank you from the bottom of my heart. ❤️❤️❤️Marla,18580,20000,22,93,195,503,6

After plenty of attempts and him almost being discharged one last time he had a stroke. The drs took the blood clots from his brain. They ran tests and found that he also has restrictive and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was in the hospital for 2 months recovering from the stroke. They had sent him home with numerous heart medications to keep his condition for quickly worsening. Routine cardiologist appts as well as others for the last 7 months.

He was in rare form and was immediately admitted to the ICU at Lowell General Hospital. He was urgently put on a ventilator and was administered antibiotics for his unknown ailment. Doctors vigorously worked around the clock to find out what suddenly took over Peter's body. They soon found out that he had been struck with Acute Bacterial Meningitis - an extremely rare and life-threatening infection.  The doctors at Lowell General Hospital are doing all they can  but it is too early to know what will come next.Peter is still unresponsive in the ICU fighting for his life. We have seen slight improvements with movements on command and we are all hopeful and praying to hear \Papa's\"" voice.What we do know is that Mr. Peter Shelzi is an \""OX\"" and this battle will take time and there is much uncertainty of what the family will need.

Jeff&#x2019;s Battle with 3 Cancers,https://www.gofundme.com/jeffs-battle-with-3-cancers,0,LONDON,OH,Jeff started out having issues with feeling full quickly while eating  and occasional stomach discomfort. He went to the doctor to have testing ran and it came back as a 5cm tumor in his retroperitoneal area behind his kidney. While in the doctors office-we noticed his neck swollen and he had to have even more scans and biopsies done to find out what it was as well. The neck came back benign  but needs taken out through surgery. The scans that came back found more spots of potential malignancies in his lung  and pelvis bone.  They went ahead and did biopsies of his lung and retroperitoneal to have concrete evidence of cancer. They both came back positive. He finally got to the point he was throwing up while eating  and was admitted into the hospital for further testing and biopsies of the “possible malignant” spots. While in the hospital-they did even more scans and biopsies and found a cancerous ulcer in his stomach that was causing blockage and that’s why he was feeling full and couldn’t eat. They placed a NG tube in his nose the second day in the hospital and it’s been draining all the yucky stuff from his belly that is causing the problems. He hasn’t eaten in almost 2 weeks and has been an inpatient at the James for a week and a half. Their current plan is for surgery early next week to remove part of his stomach  and reconnect all the organs where they need to be while removing the cancerous ulcer & place a PEG tube in his stomach. If the other stomach mass (the retroperitoneal tumor) is invading any other organs-they may go ahead and remove it while they are in there (according to the first CT scan-it’s invading the IVC-which is the main artery that brings blood from the bottom half up to the heart.) He can’t start chemo until 6 weeks after his surgery-but he will be on chemo for a while  so he will be off work until further notice. He will have multiple other surgeries and hospital stays as well as medicines and medical supplies. I don’t want them to have to worry about money while he is off work. He is trying to keep very positive about the situation  even though it’s extremely hard at times. The doctors tell us he is an extremely complicated case. Not only is he dealing with 1 cancer (those are hard enough to deal with) he’s dealing with THREE! (The lung that has metastasized to the bone  the cancerous ulcer  and the retroperitoneal mass) He does have Li-Fraumeni-which is a cancer predisposition that puts him at a higher risk of getting multiple cancers. He wants to put up a good fight to be here to watch his grandbabies grow up  and it’s been so hard for him to be away from them for as long as he has-but we know he has to in order to get better! Please share  and help any way that you can! Every little bit counts and will go towards the medical bills that will be rolling in for all of his treatment! ❤️,1630,5000,7,33,30,345,6
Medical and Living Expense Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/sdbte-medical-and-living-expense-fund,9,WHITINSVILLE,MA,Dear friends and family      As some of you know  Rachel Gravelin (our daughter  sister  aunt and friend) was recently hospitalized and put on a ventilator due an acute breathing episode.  She has had asthma for many years and was on a ventilator in the past.  With this admission it was found that she also has several severe heart conditions in addition to her chronic asthma.  These conditions require an extensive recovery period limiting her ability to work.       After being in the hospital for 11 days  expenses including medical and living  are building up rather quickly.  Rachel has several rehabilitative steps to take on her road to full recovery.  This journey towards recovery is going to take at minimum several months.  Even then it is not certain what the full outcome will be and when her ability to work full time will resume.       With her children at home and her husband physically unable to work  Rachel feels overwhelmed with all of the responsibility and financial strain.  It is for this reason we are reaching out to friends and family to help ease the burden that is presently affecting the Gravelin household.     Any donations along with your thoughts and prayers are much appreciated at this time of need.  Thank you in advance for your support.The Radfords,860,10000,23,9,10,24,6
Psychiatric Service Dog,https://www.gofundme.com/sc5bm-psychological-service-dog,7,DUNDEE,OR,I'm reaching out for help to raise the funds for the purchase and training of a Psychiatric Service Dog for my daughter Autumn.   Five years ago she began hearing voices  some telling her to put herself in danger. She started seeing things that weren't really there  and behaving strangely  occasionally stumbling about or giggling sometimes for hours at a time. Since then we have had instances of blackouts  after which she will have no memory of what occurred.   My daughter is currently unable to attend regular public school as her episodes can cause her to wander off. While her school was very supportive  they would still lose track of her. Being accompanied by a service dog  can help to ground her and keep her focused. As a young teenage girl we are concerned about the harm that could come to her and feel that her companion if not able to direct her back to her class or home  would offer some level of deterrent  to those that might take advantage of her situation.   Autumn is currently diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety  however we seem to be fighting an uphill battle as we don't have the money to pay for appointments or psychiatrists and our insurance refuses to cover it until she has another diagnosis. One we need a psychiatrist to get. We have been jumping through hoops trying to get my daughter the treatment she needs  seemingly to no avail. With a service dog I would at least have to peace of mind to know that my daughter was safe and protected.   A Psychiatric Service Dog would be trained to wake her during nightmares  interrupt  harmful repetitive behaviors; such as clawing at her skin until it bleeds  and identifying if something is real or if she is hallucinating. It would be able to lead her home when lost or it can be tracked to locate it  and by proxy my daughter  during an episode. The dog would also be tasked with creating a space in public areas to prevent people touching her or getting too close for comfort and preventing her from walking out into the road.   I desperately need to provide my child the care she needs  and it pains me knowing she isn't receiving it. She has expressed to me that she feels as though a service dog would give her the opportunity to live a somewhat normal life  and I want her to have that. Please help me give my daughter what she feels she needs to be successful  I don't know how much more I can accomplish alone.   This is Autumn's grandfather here. I thought I would add a note to share my perspective. Autumn is one of the sweetest kids and smarter than I ever was or will be. Autumn spends a lot of time with me. We have been helping with Autumn's homeschooling and care. I can't even imagine what it must be like to live in a situation where you have recurring nightmares and have times when you have to question what is real and what is not. A lot of thought and research has gone into how a service dog can be of assistance. I have come to believe that a service dog will be beneficial to Autumn in helping to restore her confidence in navigating her world.,455,18000,6,3,10,135,5

Help Ximena Fight Her Battle,https://www.gofundme.com/help-ximena-fight-her-battle,1,SEAFORD,NY,"My friend and ally Ximena Colban was diagnosed with stage II triple negative breast cancer in June. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments in a series of 16 rounds. The first 4 treatments are double doses on a bi-weekly schedule. The last 12 treatments are weekly single doses which will end in December. After completing chemotherapy it had been determined that a double mastectomy is unavoidable. Ximena is currently employed as a librarian. I am personally convinced that it is her insatiable supply of stubbornness and fortitude that gets her to work on the days that she receives treatment. Even with the unwavering support of her husband and three remarkable daughters  it is uncertain how much longer she will be able to work. That is what has convinced me of the necessity of this campaign.We have all heard the expression \It takes a village\"". I know how cliché that sounds  I also know that clichés are clichés for a reason. So  this is an attempt to cast out a net to any villagers who are able to help another in need.

Kidney Surgery for My Brother,https://www.gofundme.com/kidney-surgery-for-my-brother,4,YONKERS,NY,17 years ago  through the good graces of God  my family was able to come live in the United States. At the time it was my parents and my older brother and sister  but we became six when my little sister was born. We came here in the hopes that whatever we worked for  we could achieve  knowing that we could do far better in this country than back in the Philippines.For as long as I can remember  my parents have worked long hours to support us. My mother was a house wife in the Philippines. She was able to make herself our family’s primary bread winner here in the US. For 15 of the 17 years we’ve been here  she’s always worked at least two jobs to provide for her family. My father took over a lot of the household responsibilities  while also maintaining a full time job. Thanks to the examples our parents set  my siblings and I all became very hard workers.For the most part  my family has not only survived  but we’ve built a comfortable life here. However  life can hit you by surprise  and no one is really ever truly prepared for that. My brother has had kidney problems since he was young  but it’s a problem that he has always been able to manage. This summer  my brother went to a routine physical. In what seemed like an instant  he went from acting like his normal self  to learning that his kidneys were barely functioning  and that he needed surgery to replace them.My brother has always been a goofy  good-spirited guy  and he has tried to make light of the situation. He makes memes about himself to alleviate how bad he feels about his medical problem. The reality is that he needs a kidney transplant. If he didn’t go to that routine physical  if we found out about this problem any later  he could have been dead. Laurence Sandoval is my older brother  my mentor  my biggest rival  and my best friend. My brother and I share so many of the same interests  friends  hobbies  and ideas. He’s always been the tough guy  with a class clown attitude. He’s made me cry a million times  but even now  he refuses to cry over his condition. Once again  I’m the one left crying because I can’t do anything about it; he doesn’t even want me to donate my kidney for him. He says that he needs me to stay in school  and that it will be better if our mom does it.The truth of the matter is  my family cannot afford this surgery. My mother  our family’s main provider  is going to be his donor. We’re not sure how we can get through this financial burden  but we’re trying. It’s not easy for us  but that’s why we’re asking for your help during this difficult time. Any support or assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated.My brother's surgery is scheduled for October 30  2018. Please keep my brother and my mother in your prayers. I pray to God that one day soon  everything will be fine.,3683,15000,4,25,38,990,6
Saving Scott,https://www.gofundme.com/rd3cr-saving-scott,7,CARSON,CA,"Hello and God Bless Scott is my son and he has been diagnosed with diabetes that went untreated by physicians for years. Due to this the battle is long. He continues to be a great man that any mother would be proud of. Scott was recently diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa  a skin disease  diabetic neuropathy  and a dislocation/Subluxation of left shoulder. Scott is still waiting for more testing on his liver due to his illnesses and he may have permanent damage  and currently going to physical therapy.  He has lost his jobs due to the untreated issues but can not get unemployment due to his job not firing him and putting him as \inactive due to illness\"". He is working on his disability now but that can take years.   He is waiting for his fertility appointment to check if he is sterile and unable to have children due to infections caused by his untreated illnesses. He is in a catch 22 situation and due to other family crises it is hard to help financially. Scott had to move out of California due to the loss of his job. Scott has no children and is only 32 years old. He is down and I don't want him to feel alone. Mom's always feel they let their child down in some way and this is hard to watch when he has always been a good person  never in trouble and always there to help anyone in need. We have been separated by the cost of living and illness yet we have faith that we are not alone. We only found out about his illness after he moved away and was rushed into surgery. He was misdiagnosed several times over several years. He worries about having gas money and rent money as he gets $200 in assistance. The cost for his medical treatments and living expenses is too great.  I pray anyone in this situation will find healing and a helping hand. Thank you very much.

Our family is in financial distress,https://www.gofundme.com/our-family-is-in-financial-distress,0,RICHARDSON,TX,In August  my dear friend Steven passed away.  I was his caregiver and spent time with him seven days a week for many hours per day.  I am devastated that he is gone.  At the same time  my husband's commission-only job went into the slow season and we were very quickly left with no income.  These past two months  my husband and myself have had interviews that we both thought would went well and would result in new full-time jobs  but unfortunately nothing has materialized yet.  We keep on looking.We've been selling everything we can to get by  including heirloom jewelry  china  purses  and soon one of the cars.  My husband sold all of his professional photography equipment and his drawing monitor  so we lost that potential income as well.  We have done this to keep the lights on  water flowing  and our phones active so that we can find new jobs.  We're almost two months late on the mortgage and fear the house may be next to go.  Storms knocked down a tree in the backyard and we're praying the city continues not to notice.  The refrigerator is leaking  as is the air conditioner/furnace from the ceiling.  Charles is going up to the attic daily to bail water.  Our plumbing is backing up whenever we do a load of laundry.   Many of our friends  including my Hollins sisters  have already helped us  making it possible for us to buy groceries and to pay bills.  We are so grateful  but we're also scared.  It's making it hard to feel upbeat when we get word of new interview requests.  My head tells me that this too shall pass and that we will come into better times again  but my heart is full of fear and doubt. I never thought I would post something like this on our Hollins Facebook page.  Then again  I never thought I would be almost 46 years old with two young sons.  Those that know me are well aware of my penchant to ramble  so I'll stop here.  If anyone from my alma mater can help us  thank you.  The promise I will pledge is to pay it forward in any way I can and to be the woman that Hollins taught me to be.  I guess that includes exercising humility and asking for help  even though it's embarrassing for me to do so.  Thank you for reading this post (if you managed to get through it ;-) )  and thank you for your support.  I've received a lot of it.Love  Amy,665,2500,35,27,9,7,6

Tundra Broke His Leg,https://www.gofundme.com/tundra-broke-his-leg,6,HILLIARD,OH,Hello all  As many of you know  I recently got a Siberian husky puppy. He is just now turning 5 months old and acts just like an excited husky puppy would; full of energy and ready to go at all times. He was excited that I came home one day after a long day of classes and work and decided to run down the stairs at top speed. Unfortunately  when he did this he fell and landed on his leg and broke both his femur and tibia on his right leg. I took him to our primary vet and they told us that is it very severe and that he will have to have surgery ASAP because of the amount of pain he is in. I went  to the orthopedic vet to see what the options were to put him in the least amount of pain. We only have 2 options. He either has to under go surgery to have pins and screws put in his leg for both bones  which will cost me upwards of $5000  or we will have to amputate it for half of the cost. I have already spent $600 today on vet exam fees alone which is already hard enough for me. Unfortunately  being a fourth year college student and living on my own  I already have my plate full with expenses. I'm willing to put all of my savings toward his surgery  however  that still isn't enough to cover just the amputation. I am asking for any help I can get whether it's five dollars or a prayer. Any support would be extremely helpful and appreciated. God Bless.,925,3500,18,26,33,121,6
Chris &amp; Mindy Flood Relief,https://www.gofundme.com/chrisandmindyfloodrelief,2,WILMINGTON,NC,My name is Stephanne Marsh and I would like to share the story of my sweet brother and sister in-law. Chris  Mindy and their two precious sons  ages 5 and 2  just  purchased their first home in June of this year  in Conway  SC. Chris works 2 jobs and Mindy is an elementary school teacher. They did not have flood insurance  as they were not in a flood zone and the bank nor the insurance company recommended that they purchase it. Hurricane Florence brought total devastation to so many  Chris and Mindy included. Their new home was flooded with just over 3.5 feet of water. The waters receded enough on October 5  that they were finally able to get into the home to assess damages. They lost many personal things in the flood  but the greatest devastation was the destruction of the home that they had worked so hard to purchase. As you can see from the pictures  they will need major  mold treatment  as the house already  has extensive mold damage.  They will also need to purchase new insulation  drywall  paint  interior and exterior doors  moldings and trim  appliances   a hot water heater  and flooring.  The funds raised in this campaign will be used specifically to purchase these items and to restore their home to a livable state.I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of people nationwide here in our home of Wilmington  NC. I thought that just perhaps  through the generosity of friends and strangers alike  we just might be able to help them put their lives back together. Thank you  for taking the time to read Chris and Mindy’s story. We are grateful.,2718,10000,16,27,22,92,6

Loves playing in water to digging in the ground to being inseparable from his Brother Maison and Sister Sage. He was born with torticollis to lazy eyes and now stage 4 Hydronephrosis. All his life he was always on and off sick. The doctors would say he is just one of those kids that get sick often. In August the pain in his stomach was so bad we thought it was appendicitis. So we did a CAT scan. The CAT scan has revealed he has a serious kidney condition.  Which is a condition that causes blockage in the tube that connects to the kidney to the bladder. Further testing revealed that his right kidney is the size of a small steak filled with urine.We are on our way to doing 2 surgeries.One to fix the blockage to drain the urine into the bladder easier. They have to put in a stent to make sure the kidney can drain properly into bladder. Its a 2 night hospital stay.The second is to remove the stent in 5 to 6 weeks. We are trying to save the right kidney now because the left kidney is Stage 1 of Hydronephrosis. If the right gets fixed then their is a chance both will be saved.The doctor is Dr. Close. A well known pediatric Urologist in Henderson  Nevada.We are not financially prepared for the sudden surgery coming up October 29th.  The gift of your donations would lift this financial burden off of our shoulders so we can concentrate on the healing of our son Zach.Thank you and God Bless!James and Amber Thomas,230,13000,10,2,11,90,6

Every family's nightmare came true when they didn't return the next afternoon as they had intended. Our worst fears were realised when Jacob Pham (24) and Justin O'Neill's (32) bodies were both found in the water on Friday  while Uock Pham (50) and his brother Tuan Pham (40's) remained missing.A much loved father and partner  Justin leaves behind his fiancé Ashleigh Hough and their three little boys William (10)  Jackson (7) and Zach (3). The sweetest young man  Jacob Pham leaves behind an adoring mother  Andrea Henning  and his two sisters  Ashleigh Hough and Jiordy Pham.  As of Wednesday  10th October  the search for the remaining two men  Uock and Tuan  came to an end.  The devastating loss of each of these men has left huge holes in our family which can never be filled.My name is Belle and I am Ashleigh  Jiordy and Jacob's cousin  Andrea and Uock's niece and Justin's soon-to be cousin-in-law. I am based in Sydney. We are raising funds through this page in order to assist with the costs of the upcoming funerals of Justin  Jacob and Uock. Requiring funerals so early in their lives was not prepared for and  especially at this time of intense grief  the support of the community through donations to the Go Fund me page will assist us to no end.Any money left over after the ceremonies will go towards supporting the dependant family that Justin left behind - stay at home mum Ashleigh and the three young boys - with their cost of living now that the family's breadwinner is no longer with us. The funds will be called upon as soon as it's time for the necessary arrangements to be made. Please keep our family in your thoughts as we continue through life without the kind  gentle and supportive presence of the men in our family.

Clark&apos;s road to recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/clark039s-road-to-recovery,9,HARTSELLE,AL,On Tuesday  October 2nd  our lives changed forever. Our son  Clark  came to Children's of Alabama for an SEEG. I got a phone call from the doctor for consultation  thinking they were going to  tell me everything went well and we could go back to the room. When I sat down with the surgeon  he told me that my sons vitals went flat. They then realized that an electrode was pushed too deep and burst a blood vessel  causing a blood clot and bleed on the brain. For over an hour  I didn't know if my son was going to make it or not  but thank God they safely removed the clot and stopped the bleeding. They had to leave part of the skull out until the swelling in his brain goes down. He is now stable  awake and talking. However the left side of his body is so weak that he can't walk  use his left hand  and his left eye has trouble focusing. His recovery could be anywhere from 6 months to a year. We are asking for donations to help support our little man. He will be in the hospital for a long time  and he will need a lot of therapy and many other things to help him along the way. Any donation is appreciated  and we thank you in advance!,1125,1000,5,113,22,382,6
Legs for Bob Wheeler,https://www.gofundme.com/legs-for-bob-wheeler,0,CLINTON,MA,My Dad  my hero  is a man that has lived through a lot of grief in life. And he always soldiers through whatever lemons are thrown at him.His latest lemon  is he had to have both his legs amputated above the knee due to cardiovascular disease. That's a super sized lemon. I am reluctantly posting this fundraiser for him  because we are both too stubborn to ask for help. With anything.  Well  it has come to the point where we need help.As many of you probably know  my dad has gone through a series of amputations due to vascular disease. It started back in 2015  when my mom was bed ridden due to a stroke. He cared for her  with all his everything while neglecting his own health. He didn't even think twice about it because my mom was the love of his life. She passed away on September 15th  2016.It was shortly after that my dad had his first amputation. He dealt with it like a trooper. They removed half of his left foot. Several months after  it became more and more amputations. Little by little  each and every time became more and more painful and difficult. Any good news that gave us a shred of hope  always ended up stinging a little more. My dad  a veteran who served our country from 1967-1973  during the war in Vietnam  although wasn't deployed  was in the guard and ready to put his life on the line for our country. Now  he has lost both his legs due to his cardiovascular disease. He is in and out of the hospital and rehab when all he wants is to be home with his dogs. He can't imagine his life without them. He has already lost so much  and he knows his two Pomeranians are next. The reason I am posting this is because I want my dad to have the chance to feel human again. His prosthetic legs are going to cost $2500 each  and his utility bills are costing us too much money. He ran out of oil twice in the dead of winter  and his cable was shut off as well. At one point he thought he wasn't going to be able to feed his dogs. The bank is in the process of foreclosing on his home  because he doesn't have the income since my mom passed away. I am an only child with a 3 year old child of my own. My husband and I are trying to get our home handicap accessible  which is costing us money we don't have. If anyone can contribute to help my dad  we will be forever grateful. It's the little things that mean so much to us that we take for granted. Having a roof over our heads  having food in the refrigerator  having heat when it is cold outside  having toilet paper (yes TP is a priority). Every little bit helps. Hug your parents as often as you can. Thank you. God Bless. Tammy,4431,12000,9,37,50,461,6

She is surrounded by family and friends who love and cherish her with immensity   and who continue to give her their all to fight by her side. For the last year  my mom has endured heroic feats of survival. Multiple surgeries  paralyzed vocal chords  illness-induced famine  severe pain  deteriorating bone marrow  neuropathy  numerous trips to the emergency room  and other forms of the most harrowing and intense effects these drugs and the disease offer  all compromised her health to the point of nearly no return. Traditional chemotherapy stopped working after the first four months. During the next seven months  doctors pivoted with more drugs  different dosages  more scans  and more blood tests. The conclusion soon came that this cancer was no longer responsive to their treatments. She is now no longer a candidate for traditional chemotherapy. It has had its time and ran its toll.While at a crossroads  we asked the undeniable question  what can be done to support her next phase of healing? Without a shadow of a doubt  my mom needs urgent treatment. And she found a place that she believes can provide her with the therapy she needs. She gratefully learned about a team of medical doctors who provide a range of intensive integrative cancer therapies  from vaccines to insulin-targeted chemotherapies  nutriceutical IV infusions and more. The clinic is called San Diego Clinic  located in Tijuana  500 yards from the California border. My mother’s dear friend recently shared a story about her friends brother who is successfully healing his late-stage cancer with the San Diego Clinic medical team within TWO MONTHS of receiving their treatments. Other patients  with cases worse than my mother’s  have also successfully treated their cancer with the clinic’s therapies  and they have lived to share their miraculous stories. At San Diego Clinic  the treatments are outpatient  out-of-state  and nontraditional  so their comprehensive care is not covered by her insurance provider. The patients must bear the costs.  She said to me recently  “So  here I am  I have a cancer that is continuing to grow. A body that cannot tolerate anymore of the traditional medical treatment (chemotherapy). And  I have medical bills from the home infusion (TPN)  Labs  the Clinic  several ER visits and inpatient admissions due to the effects of the chemotherapy.” Her employer  a health facility medical billing office  does not offer medical disability benefits. She has been working from home to support herself during her illness. Although she feels grateful to be able to have the opportunity  on many days she is too sick to work  but she handles it anyway. Thankfully  the insurance she receives has covered most of her expenses so far  and should cover additional follow-up tests and scans once she is back home in Minnesota.My mother is prepared to go to the clinic in order to save her life  and our family and friends fully support her choice to courageously step into her next phase of healing. She just received her first passport at a young 58 (!!).We equally support her desire to open a fund and to reach out to all loving and supportive communities who may best facilitate her healing journey. Without it  she will not be able to receive this treatment.My mother is a magical gift  a deep-hearted human  a generous friend  a loving sister and daughter  a wonderful mom  and an infinitely gorgeous spirit. I am beyond grateful and proud to be her daughter and to have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to know her. It is an honor to help her mobilize her dream and make it into a reality. Everything in my power is set to support her in realizing her vision.  I hope that it will give her life back in return. I hope you will lift her up in your prayers and thoughts. If you are able to contribute to her fundraiser as well  we wholeheartedly thank you. Beyond words. Many hands make this being-alive possible. As her circle of familiar faces holds her up in happiness  healing  and wholeness  know that your support of any variety will be met with the deepest gratitude from my mother  myself  and our friends and family.I hope that she will be able to share this miraculous healing story with you and be a healed example far and wide. Please feel welcome to share her story and plan with your communities; we will gratefully receive any prayers and support for her healing.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts  and many blessings.Love and light VictoriaTREATMENT COSTSan Diego Clinic’s intensive treatment costs between $5 000 to $6 000 per week  estimated length of stay for initial in-clinic treatment is 6-8 weeks.  This price does not include outside treatments or any diagnostics  scans  or therapies  including surgery  received outside of the San Diego Clinic (SDC). An 8-week home program will be designed which will include some of the immune therapies as well as prescribed supplements. The estimated cost will be determined after final evaluation at the clinic.All costs are estimated by the service providers at their highest end:San Diego Clinic In-Clinic Intensive Treatments:  $6 000 x 8 weeks = $48 000Lodging in Tijuana:  $1 400 per month x 2 months = $2 800San Diego Clinic Home Treatments and Supplements (est):  $14 000 for 8 weeks = $14 000Total Cost Estimate: $64 800TRAVEL COSTHer sister will be driving her from Minnesota to Tijuana; estimated 4 000 miles round trip. We are including this in the overall fund so that she may have this covered as well.Gas price estimate is based on AAA calculations:Minnesota-San Diego-Tijuana RT (est): $2.8-$3.8 x 4 000 mi. = $450OOP COSTHer OOP costs are a product of her health insurance limitations. The total is calculated due to 2x $3 000 deductibles in 2017 and 2018 plus coinsurance amounts. The home infusion therapy services for IV nutrition were approximately $5 000. She has already paid some of it down.We are including her current medical debt in the overall fund amount so that she may be unburdened from this as well.Current Medical Debt: $8 000TOTAL COST:  $73 250TREATMENT PROTOCOLThe treatment plan is based upon a 6-8-week clinical program (5 days per week) to begin utilizing a personalized protocol of the following therapies:Weekly/monthly blood work – CBC  SMAC  PLQ  Cancer markers - samples are taken every Monday while in treatment with SDC.  IPT (insulin potentiated therapy) modified chemotherapy - small  fractionated chemotherapy dosage applied on a weekly basis. This small dose chemotherapy minimizes side effects without affecting the efficacy of the treatment. It is only applicable to patients sensitive to chemotherapy.Small dose Chemotherapy will be implemented based upon a Chemo Sensitivity Test. This unique blood test assists in targeting the most effective chemotherapy agents as well as natural substances to be utilized in your specific treatment program.Whole Body Hyperthermia – Enhances the benefits of chemotherapy with a synergistic effect to kill cancer cells.  Also enhances the immune system and assists in detoxification of the body. Given daily for the first two weeks of therapy and then adjusted accordingly.Metabolic therapy:Vitamin C & K therapy – (apoptosis/ antioxidant) Produces apoptosis and eliminates free radicals; free radicals produce pain and inflammation.Chelation therapy – To detoxify the body  eliminate heavy metal poisoning  dissolve cholesterol plaque  reduce free radicals  control inflammation  and regulate blood pressure.Neurolax IV therapy - Immune enhancer with specific anticancer effect. This is a combination of trace-minerals and Phospholipase A2 that protects V.S. chemo side effects. Polypeptides IV therapy – An essential treatment to protect liver  spleen  kidneys and bone marrow from the side effects of cancer treatments. Folinic acid – Reduced folic acid.  Used both to enhance chemotherapy treatment and reduce side effects.Selenium IV therapy – Enhances lymphatic drainage and immune system function.   It also has an anti-cancer effect& stops metastasis. Zinc IV therapy - The lack of zinc in our bodies has been implicated not only in the initiation of certain cancers but also in the transition  progression and metastasis of the disease.   When Zinc is deficient  cellular functioning is compromised. Zinc IV therapy is an essential treatment for mineral and immune system balance. Amygdaline IV therapy – (Laetrile) it has specific anti-cancer effects. Alban solution IV therapy – anti-inflammatory treatment. Alban is a combination of H2O2 and DMSO.  Carzilasa IV therapy -A macro energy molecule that represents a real direct donating source of energy for the function of the cells. The active substance is cocarboxylase or thiamine pyrophosphate. This coenzyme reactivates the Krebs cycle.Nuverasa – (anti-viral therapy) Enhances immune system function and produces apoptosis Immune therapy:Allergostop vaccine – This autologous vaccine (vaccine from patient’s own blood) re-programs (modulates) the immune system. Dendritic cell vaccine with Telomerase inhibitors - This autologous vaccine (vaccine from patient’s own blood) isolates the dendritic cells  which are then cultured in a lab and trained to identify cancer cells.  This process stimulates the immune system and NK cells to destroy cancer cells. Added Telomerase inhibitors help dendritic cells to stop reproduction of cancer cells. Heptasaccharide vaccine(**)- An autologous vaccine that targets seven surface antigens of cancer cells. This vaccine is effective for most solid tumors.   Orthomolecular vaccine (**) – This vaccine is developed from urine sample. It helps to restore signaling between nervous system and rest of the body throughout neurotransmitters (specific proteins) that promote correct immune system function and proper healing processes.Mycoplasma vaccine (**) – Eighty percent of cancer cells have been linked directly to mycoplasma. This autologous vaccine (vaccine from patient’s own blood) eliminates mycoplasma and indirectly destroys cancer cells.  Neo Springer vaccine – This specific synthetic vaccine targets Sialic Acid which is produced by cancer cells (up to 95%).  Transfer factor – A dialyzed leukocyte extract with immune modulation effects on both the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response.  In cancer response  it has shown to activate CD8 and lymphocytes  decrease metastasis  aid in bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy treatments  and improve overall condition.Anti-enox vaccine (**). Targets Cancer stem cells (CIC’s)  responsible to release enox -2 protein  which stimulates tumor growth.**The use of these vaccines will be determined upon testing results completed at SDC.Supplement programAn oral supplemental program is specifically designed to your needs while in treatment at SDC. It will be designed after the first week at the clinic.,3240,73250,17,4,34,131,6
Liver Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/gwpkh-liver-transplant,0,GRASSVALLEY,CA,Hi.  My name is Chris White.  I have Non-Alcoholic Degenerative Liver.  Essentially  my liver is dying.  And  I didn’t do any of the things or catch any of the things that would cause this.   Some people just wind up with it.  Unfortunately  I'm one of them.I am working on getting on the waiting list for a liver transplant.  However  once that goes through I will need to stay near the hospital for at least 30 days after the operation.  Totaling up the various costs is going to be about $7000 (which is a scary amount of money for me).  (Sutter Health - Sutter Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco).  Anything given that is beyond what I have asked for is always helpful.  There are a ton of medicalconcerns and costs that I have have not thought of at this time.In the meantime  I’ve been singing and volunteering with the Twin Cities Church choir and Music in the Mountains choir (2nd Tenor).  I’ve also been try to give time to the animal shelter and to our local radio station in Nevada City (KVMR) and our Community Events Center (in Grass Valley).  For a long time I’ve also helped run a 12 step support group but I couldn’t do it all so I had to let something go.  I’ve never been a big drinker and it has really never really appealed to me.  And  what alcohol I might have had in the past is nowhere near enough to cause this.  I also don’t take recreational drugs or smoke.  In other words  this is NOT something that I caused.  I do want to continue volunteering with my life.  Having this transplant would help me towards that.  I also have a personal faith in Christ (and I feel that each person needs to decide what they believe on their own without coercion).  This belief does help me most of the times but  and I have to be honest  there are some really bad days sometimes.  Please help!  And thank you. Chris White9/26/2018:My 1994 Honda accord: only the driver side window works  the internal fan stopped working  the breaks need to be done  the front window has cracks  and the air conditioning doesn't work. On top of that I am on permanent disability. I can't work right now and I can't pay for any of it. I was just told that I have a tumor on my liver that has to be treated which means more driving to San Francisco that has to be treated before a transplant. I'm scared. And  I need severe monetary help ( or a new car). I'm very scared  upset  in pain  and exhausted....I need more than prayer. I don't know what to do. I do want to live. Very much so. And my faith does help. Today was a really  really bad day.,7547,9000,17,84,62,236,6
Alexus Thompson Road to Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/near-death-car-accident-recovery,5,GRESHAM,OR,Alexus Thompson’s Road to Recovery September 24th was supposed to be the beginning of Alexus’ second year at Mt Hood Community College where she is studying to become a nurse. But on the way to school  with her twin 3 year old sons in tow  Alexus ran into a metal telephone pole  in order to prevent a collision with another car  and sustained life threatening injuries. When the paramedics arrived  they found Alexus unconscious and unresponsive with no heartbeat. She was rushed to OHSU in Portland  along with the twins who suffered minor injuries. Miraculously  doctors were able to revive Alexus and she is extremely thankful to just be alive and available to continue raising her young boys as a single parent. But Alexus did sustain some major injuries in the accident including a severe concussion  a broken ankle  broken sternum  broken ribs  broken jaw and a broken eye socket. Numerous lacerations cover her face and body with a lacerated liver being the most serious. Recovery from these injuries will take a minimum of three months. Alexus is experiencing a great deal of physical pain and light sensitivity triggering migraines  as the result of her broken eye socket. She is limited in mobility and not allowed to carry anything because it could cause internal bleeding and further tear her liver. Daily living expenses and upcoming medical procedures are adding to emotional stress. Tomorrow  on October 7  Alexus goes into the hospital for emergency surgery to wire her jaw shut for 6 weeks. Alexus is a strong  independent 22 year old woman who has overcome numerous obstacles including abuse in her life. She is a loving mother to her twins whom she ferociously protects. She is striving to financially provide for her family’s future as she works towards a college degree in nursing. However  this accident creates a major set back to her goals. Here are some needs that we have assessed so far:Alexus relies upon school grants to pay for her schooling and daily living expenses. She has lost that funding for this quarter  since she isunable to attend classes because of her injuries. Therefore she needs rent money to keep her apartment and pay utilities.Alexus’ car was totaled in the accident and there are no funds to replace it.The night before the accident  Alexus went to the laundry mat and those clothes were still in the car when the accident happened and consequently were destroyed and now need to be replaced.The boys car seats were deemed unsafe after the accident and need to be replaced.The biggest requirement for Alexus to heal and rehabilitate is rest and care for herself  which is almost impossible as a single parent of twin 3 year olds. Therefore funds are needed to provide a round the clock caregiver for Alexus and her sons. A trusted friend has agreed to take on this responsibility but funds are needed so she can afford to take more time off from work to continue to provide 24 hour care for Alexus and the boys. Alexus desperately wants to get through the next 3 months without State assistance or interference and be assured that her healing happens in a safe and restful environment. Alexus is a fighter; but the next 3 months look daunting. She is determined to approach what lies ahead with thankfulness and determination. Alexus and her boys sincerely appreciate all the love  support and prayers they have received through this ordeal. She is looking forward to communicating and giving updates to those who are following her story.,1675,10000,5,17,36,656,6

Help Us Get Service Dogs!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-us-get-service-dogs,7,STONEHAM,MA,Recently  I was sent an email from my mother that essentially said I am in charge of paying for my service dog now  because I don't talk to her.My service dog qualifies as a piece of medical equipment  as she is a psychiatric and mobility service dog. She is trained to do deep pressure therapy  to interrupt harmful behavior  to look for cars when I might not be able to  to interrupt dissociative episodes with forced petting and licking  and may eventually be trained to recognize when my heart condition acts up. My twin  Hayden  is also in the process of having their dog trained for service work  and he will be trained to do many of the same things.We do not need the funds immediately  but we do need as much help as possible. We're both full time college students with jobs  and while we have some money  the majority of it goes to paying for medications that are over $100 every couple weeks  as well as doctor's visits  therapists  and psychiatry visits. Currently  the bill for both dogs is over $6000. We can't possibly come up with that money in any kind of reasonable timeline  and we are hoping y'all could help. My mother has a history of abusive and erratic behavior towards me and my sibling  and despite our chronic mental health problems  refuses to recognize how her behavior hurts us. If you can spare anything  we'd be more than grateful.,432,7000,32,6,10,12,6
Lisa Assad Hitchings CO poisoning,https://www.gofundme.com/lisa-hitchings-co2-poisoning,0,CLYMER,PA,My Name is Dawn Davies  some of you may know me as Dawn Crawford. I had a name change recently. Why I’m writing here is because of my dear friend Lisa Assad Hitchings. She has had so many health issues in the last 6 years. She had two blood clots in her brain that only 20% survive it  and here she is  surviving.  This is called Venus Sinus Thrombosis. Two years ago she got shingles on her head  face and eye and continues to suffer daily pain from them.  Lisa can’t even have any hair touching the left side of her forehead due to its sensitivity. This time she was poisoned by carbon monoxide from her furnace while cleaning up her flooded  moldy basement. She had her furnace running  as she was trying to dry it out. However  unbeknownst to her  the furnace’s heating chamber was faulty  and may have been leaking for a year  according to the furnace man. As she cleaned  she was breathing in the carbon monoxide. When she went to work the next day  she was taken by ambulance to the hospital. She blacked out at work and has no recollection of even driving to work. She has not been back to work since September 18  2018  and has been in and out of the hospital several times to try and get the carbon monoxide poisoning out of her.  We also found out she has had a mini stroke sometime!            Still has her sense of humor! She is unable to return to work at this time  and unfortunately  her workplace does not have short term disability. Lisa works with children who have mental health issues  and is so very good at what she does. I am sure the kids are missing her and wondering where she is. She loves her job and would like to return ASAP. Lisa has used all her sick days as well. My friend cannot even go back into her own house yet. Luckily  for her  she has a friend she is able to stay with  and her mother is staying with her as she cannot be left alone. Even walking is difficult for her. She loses her balance and walks with a cane. At times she cannot even remember her grandkids names. Lisa has visiting nurses  OT  PT and Speech coming in at least twice a week to help her gain her short memory and strength back. She’s having a processing issue due to toxin poisoning the brain.  Right now Lisa is walking with a cane as she looses her balance and gets dizzy.  Lisa’s hands hurt and want to close  she has to concentrate to try to open them  has a hard time holding things and must try with both hands but even then it’s difficult. Lisa has to take a break and rest when concentrating as she gets headaches and tired easily.  Her arms are numb and tingly and is hard to lift them up  needs assistance with pullover tops at times. Lisa is such a loving and happy person  it breaks my heart to see her struggle so much. She can’t play with her grandchildren like she wants to and is worried about getting her house fixed and a new furnace. Her roof needs fixed as well as her outside basement door. And the mold needs taken care of  too. The list just goes on and on. Lisa has no income at this time  and bills to pay. She does not know how she is going to meet her financial responsibilities.So if you could find it in your heart to help her  please help. We have set up this fund #toxicfreelife to try and alleviate some of the hardships she is facing! Follow Lisa’s journey on our Facebook page... Lisa Hitchings poisoned by Carbon MonoxideUPDATED FROM MOM:  Lisa had an appointment with a Neurologist on Tuesday. The Dr is sending her for additional bloodwork and testing. He feels there is more going on with her than just the lasting effects from the Carbon monoxide poisoning. Lisa is still unsteady walking and must use a cane  occupational  physical and speech therapist and a visiting nurse continue to work with her. Lisa becomes frustrated and upset when she is trying to talk and the words won't come out or just can't remember.As a parent  it is difficult watching your child encounter severe health issues  as well as  financial problems with no income. I thank God everyday that I still have her in my life. I just cant think of what could have happened had she been in the house sny longer. We have an appointment next week with social security to apply for SSD. As most of you know  this can take some time and many appeals. I pray that she won't have to go through years of appeals as others have. Lisa was approved for medical through welfare but no monetary assistance.My dear family and friends  Lisa is in much need of your help financially. I'm asking you to donate to the Go Fund Me account that is set up or send donations directly to her at: Lisa Hitchings  P O Box 45  Clymer  PA 15728. I know times are tough for many of you and I don't like asking but donations of any amount would greatly be appreciated. I just don't know what else to do. Please share our posts to your friends and family. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Lisa had a furnace donated by a local church. We are just overwhelmed by their kind generosity to provide her with some of the help she needs. There are still wonderful people in this world. Thank you for being one of them. Love to all.

Family in need.,https://www.gofundme.com/e4kbjr-family-in-need,0,STANHOPE,NJ,Let's see  where do I start?  This kind of thing is hard for me.  I'm 35 with a loving husband and 2 beautiful healthy kids. I recently found out we were pregnant with our third child which for anyone should be a happy time.  Soon after being told I was 14 weeks pregnant I'm told I have Ovarian cancer and need to start treatment asap. The chemotherapy has taken a real toll on me and I have trouble doing daily housework but can eventually get it done. My husband recently lost his job taking too much time off to care for the kids as well as do repairs to our 1990 Dodge Caravan.  I have to drive to my chemotherapy with no windshield wipers on my car when it rains and now the thermostat went so we have no heat.  As well as needing new brakes among other things. I found out that my insurance company will no longer cover some of my medications.  One of which is over $300 for a 7 day supply and thats with a discount. I'm at my wits end and dont know what to do.  Anything that anyone can help with even if it's just a dollar. It goes a long way.  Now more than ever I need more positivity in my life and people who care enough to lend a helping hand. My immediate family is my support  and some school friends have reached out and helped us tremendously. So we are grateful for that. We are also in the process of trying to find a place to live as the house we live in is on the market and might be sold soon. Having 2 small children  a serious disease and treatment that takes a toll on me  as well as my husband looking for work has been alot for us to handle and God willing we will get through this.  We just dont know where else to turn. Thank you for reading my story.  Sometimes it helps to get some of this off my chest.  I'm overwhelmed.,1670,5000,16,33,21,86,6

McKenna&apos;s Mystery Blood Disorder,https://www.gofundme.com/mckenna039s-mystery-blood-disorder,7,AUDUBON,IA,When you look at McKenna she looks like the average beautiful all American 16 year old girl.  What you don’t see behind her big smile is the pain and bleeding she deals with daily.  She doesn’t complain  just goes about her day struggling to be normal.  She began having issues with severe bleeding during her menstrual cycles at the age of 12 yrs old.  She has cramping as well as passes large clots at times.  As she got older  she continued to bleed more severely and continuously for nearly four years to date.   McKenna also has unexplained nose bleeds and more recently had blood coming from her ear for no apparent reason.  She began her medical journey with local doctors.  As expected  they could not diagnose her because all of her lab reports and ultrasounds show normal results.  She was referred to Iowa City physicians who specialize with pediatric hematology and gynecology.  This is nearly a 3 ½ hour drive one way.  They diagnosed her with Von Willebrand’s Disease  a rare blood disorder which also makes her a hemophiliac.  The gynecology department could not find any issues with her reproductive system and could not explain why she continuously bleeds stating it must be due to her blood disorder.  They tried several medications to no avail including visits to the local ER  Mercy Medical  and to Blank Children’s Hospital to administer a drug via IV used to slow the bleeding and give her a boost when she would pass out.  She has also been referred to Nebraska Medical Center in hopes that one of their doctors could find a medication to work as the previous medications prescribed through IV no longer stopped the bleeding.  These doctors did not believe that she had Von Willebrand’s Disease.  A year ago a local physician took McKenna’s case to heart and decided to work with Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN.  This is a world renowned center of physicians over 6 hours away.  They verified McKenna also has Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) a vitamin K deficiency which causes her to pass out when she over works her system such as playing basketball.  Her one and true passion!!  While at Mayo Clinic the doctors couldn’t find a cause of the bleeding as again all the labs and ultrasounds were normal nor did any medications that they administered stop the bleeding  but stated that they did believe that she had Von Willebrand’s Disease.   Mayo Clinic’s final recommendation was to give her a hysterectomy.   The doctors making this determination cannot confirm that taking this drastic step will actually stop her from bleeding as she continues to also have nose bleeds that obviously have nothing to do with her reproductive system.  She is 16 years old!!!The request for Go Fund Me is to allow McKenna to seek medical assistance out of state.  There are two hematologists  one in Texas and one in Washington who after reviewing her case files feel there has to be a better option than to give this 16 year old girl a hysterectomy when there is no indication it will stop her from bleeding!  The insurance company has denied the referral request to either of these out of state physicians indicating she should continue to seek medical care through in state doctors even  listing several she has already visited.   Her parents have been told without insurance the out of pocket minimum for labs and office visits to both a hematologist and gynecologist in either state will be nearly $20 000 for a single visit.  That cost does not include travel or lodging.   Right now there are two hematologists that believe a hysterectomy won’t solve McKenna’s bleeding issues  but she is being denied the request for them to even look at her because of insurance.  Please help us give her that chance!,2455,25000,5,10,27,530,6
Diksavati Liver Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/diksavati-liver-recovery,9,BENLOMOND,CA,My mother  Diane Diksavati Normand went into liver failure three weeks ago and has been suffering greatly ever since. She was diagnosed with liver sclerosis five years ago; we think this is the cause of her current situation but we’ve received very different diagnoses from doctors. Currently  local doctors are trying to find the right medication to keep her as comfortable as possible. She’s meeting with a liver specialist from Stanford later this month and working with a Chinese Medicine Liver specialist to reduce symptoms. Ultimately  it looks like she will need a liver transplant. Her condition is is not bad enough to keep her admitted in the hospital but her condition is too unstable to be left alone. My father  Sarvabhavana Owen Normand has been taking care of her 24/7 and needs financial support for medication  living expenses and to hire a caregiver. Both of my parents have been actively participating in our community for over forty years; being of support to anyone in need.

Aidez-moi &#xE0; conserver ma maison de 5e g&#xE9;n&#xE9;ration,https://www.gofundme.com/aidezmoi-a-conserver-ma-maison,3,G6B1L1Lac-MéganticQuébecCanada,CA,Bonjour à tousBienvenue quelque instant dans un court voyage au centre de mon univers. Laissez-moi me présenter. Je m'appelle Daniel Arguin  je suis une personne quadriplégique depuis 25 ans maintenant et je suis âgé de 44 ans que je n'ai pas vu passer. J’habite la belle région de Lac-Mégantic au Québec. Je tiens déjà à vous remercie du fond du cœur pour l'intérêt et le temps que vous démontrez à mon égard. Je vous souhaite une bonne lecture.Hi everyoneWelcome for a moment in a short trip to the center of my universe. Let me introduce myself. My name is Daniel Arguin  I have been a quadriplegic for 25 years now and I am 44 years old.  I have not seen these years go by. I live in the beautiful Lac-Mégantic region of Quebec. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the interest and the time you show me.J'habite une maison bigénérationnelle qui date de 1875 à coté de mes parents. J'habite la moitié de cette maison et mes parents habitent l'autre moitié qui communique à tous les étages. Dans mon enfance  mes grands-parents partageaient la maison avec nous. Depuis  c'est moi qui ai traversé le mur et qui habite leur appartement. Il s'agit aussi de la 4e maison la plus âgé de notre belle petite ville. Pour les deux premières générations  je n'ai vu que des photos  dont celle-ci lors du début de la Première Guerre Mondiale en 1914.I live in a bigenerational house that dates to 1875 next to my parents. I live half of this house and my parents live the other half who communicates on all floors. In my childhood  my grandparents shared the house with us. Since then  it's me who crossed the wall and who lives in their apartment. It is also the 4th oldest house in our beautiful little town. For the first two generations  I only saw pictures  including this one at the start of the First World War in 1914.Je suis une personne très solitaire qui ne connaît pas ce qu’est la chance et la santé  à part la plus importante  celle d’avoir les meilleurs parents du monde. Mais  je vie dans la maladie depuis ma naissance. Dès mon jeune âge  j’avais des bronchites et des pneumonies à répétition. À mes 16 ans  j’ai été diagnostiqué de la maladie de Hodgkin. Tout juste un peu avant Mario Lemieux  mon idole de jeunesse atteint lui aussi. I am a very lonely person who does not know what luck and health are  apart from the most important one  having the best parents in the world. But I have lived in sickness since my birth. From an early age  I had bronchitis and recurrent pneumonia. When I was 16  I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Just a little before Mario Lemieux  my idol of youth reached him too.J’ai dû combattre en recevant 6 mois de chimiothérapie très agressive  28 séances de radiothérapie et une opération majeure avant de vaincre cette maladie ou ce cancer pour de bon. Étant donné que j’étais rendu invincible après avoir vaincu la maladie de Hodgkin qui est un cancer  qui aurait pu croire ou prédire qu’une quadriplégie m’attendais à mes 19 ans à la suite d’un foutu mauvais plongeon dans une piscine  lors d’un bref voyage avec des amis en juin 1993 aux États-Unis.I had to fight by receiving 6 months of very aggressive chemotherapy  28 radioltherapy sessions and a major operation before I could conquer this disease or cancer for good. Since I was made invincible after defeating Hodgkin's disease that is cancer  who could have believed or predicted that a quadriplegia was waiting for me when I was 19 years old after a damn bad dip in a pool  during a brief trip with friends in June 1993 in the United States.Me voilà donc en 2018 25 ans ont passés déjà et malgré tout  je ne peux pas dire que j’ai été si malheureux. J’ai complété mes études et j’ai travaillé 15 ans en comptabilité dans le club de golf local et j’en suis très fier. Ce qui m’a permis d’acheter la maison familiale  un de mes rêves qui n’a heureusement pas été touchée par l’accident ferroviaire de juillet 2013 faisant 47 morts ici à Lac-Mégantic à deux rues de chez-moi où toutes les maisons qui ont résisté au feu ont été détruites à cause de la contamination par le pétrole.So here I am in 2018 25 years have passed already and despite everything  I can not say that I was so unhappy. I completed my studies and worked 15 years in accounting at the local golf club and I am very proud of it. This allowed me to buy the family home  one of my dreams that was fortunately not affected by the train accident of July 2013 killing 47 people here in Lac-Mégantic two blocks from home where all houses that resisted fire were destroyed because of oil contamination.Cependant  la maladie est venue frapper à nouveau. Je me suis infligé une plaie de pression très profonde  presque rendu à l’os au siège. Elle me tient au lit à ce jour depuis les 20 derniers mois. Les seules fois que je me suis levé  je suis allé 6-7 fois au champ de tir et aux rendez-vous médicaux. Comme je ne peux travailler adéquatement  je n’ai donc plus de travail et plus de salaire  mais l’hypothèque hebdomadaire réussie toujours à se rendre quand même à moi.However  the disease came knocking again. I inflicted myself a very deep pressure wound  almost returned to the bone at the seat. It keeps me in bed so far for the last 20 months. The only time I got up  I went 6-7 times to the shooting range and to my medical appointments. Since I can not work properly  I do not have any more work and no salary  but the weekly mortgage always succeeds in getting to me anyway.C’est avec beaucoup d’humilité  une culpabilité incroyable et après plusieurs semaines de réflexions que je me suis laissé convaincre de tenter ma chance et de mettre de côté mon embarras pour créer un compte FUND ME qui raconte mon histoire. Même si je suis un battant dans la vie  obtenir un soutien financier me met mal à l'aise et je ne veux offenser personne.It is with great humility  incredible guilt and after several weeks of reflections that I was convinced to try my luck and put aside my embarrassment to create a FUND ME account that tells my story. Although I am a fighter in life  getting financial support makes me uncomfortable and I do not want to offend anyone.Objectif :  / Goal :Ramasser la somme de 32 000$ CA soit approximativement des dons provenant de 8 000 individus à raison de 5 00$ chacun moins les frais administratifs. Mais ce n'est qu'un calcul rapide de la situation. Il s'agit du solde de mon hypothèque qui me cause de nombreuses nuits blanches. C'est un stress constant qui n'aide en rien à ma guérison.  Je ne veux également  ne pas laisser de dettes advenant mon décès à mon entourage.Collect C $ 32 000 or approximately 8  000 donations at $ 5.00 each  less administrative costs. But this is only a quick calculation of the situation. This is the balance of my mortgage that causes me many sleepless nights. It's a constant stress that does not help my recovery. I also do not want to leave debts in the event of my death to my entourage.Avec l’aide de la communauté internet  d’ici les trois prochains mois  nous pouvons régler cette situation  puisque nous sommes 7 5 milliards d’êtres humains sur terre et nous devons nous entraider. Le 31 marrs 2019  je vais tout faire ce que je peux pour rapprocher le solde le plus près de zéro possible  avant de ne plus être capable de rencontrer les paiements et de perdre ma maison.With the help of the internet community  in the next three months  we can solve this situation  since we are 7.5 billion people on earth and we need to help each other. On March 31  2019  I will do everything I can to bring the balance closer to zero as possible  before I can no longer meet the payments and lose my house.Tout ça pour vous dire qu'une plaie de pression au siège me cloue au lit depuis déjà 20 mois et elle n'est pas guérie à 100% encore.  Je suis quadriplégique depuis 25 ans et cette plaie est la pire chose qui me soit arrivée depuis. Car en plus d’être paralysé au départ  je suis cloué au lit 24/24 ces temps-ci  ce qui rend le travail  la recherche de travail et donc le salaire impossible. Après une si longue période la réserve achève.All this to tell you that a sore pressure in the seat has bedridden me for 20 months already and it is not healed 100% yet. I have been a quadriplegic for 25 years and this sore is the worst thing that has happened to me since. Because in addition to being paralyzed initially  I am bedridden 24/24 these days  which makes work  looking for work and therefore the salary impossible. After such a long time the reserve is getting empty.Je suscite votre grande générosité pour m’aider à conserver ma maison bigénérationnelle dont je suis la 5e génération à l'habiter. La maison est tout adaptées pour mon fauteuil roulant  ce qui la rend essentielle à ma condition de vie.  La maladie m’empêche d’y subvenir moi-même n’ayant pas eu de salaire depuis 2 ans  ce qui en fait un gros poids sur les épaules. Je ne veux pas forcer personne à contribuer si vous ne n'en avez pas envie  mais une chose qui est aussi importante à faire  c’est de faire circuler cette campagne de financement. Faites-la circuler à travers vos contacts afin de la propager le plus possible  car c’est ce qui en fera une réussite ou pas. Je vous remercie du fond du cœur. Je vous souhaite de passer de très joyeuses fêtes en famille Je vous souhaite beaucoup de santé  c’est la chose Ia plus importante  je suis bien placé pour en parler. Je vous aime tous et merci de m’aider tout le monde.I arouse your great generosity to help me keep my bigenerational home of which I am the 5th generation to live in. The house is all adapted for my wheelchair  which makes it essential to my life condition. The disease prevents me from supporting myself having not had a salary for 2 years  which is a heavy burden on the shoulders. I do not want to force anyone to contribute if you do not want to  but one thing that's also important to do is get this fundraising campaign going. Make it circulate through your contacts to spread as much as possible  because that's what will make it a success or not. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wish you a very happy holiday with your family I wish you a lot of health  that's the most important thing  I'm in a good position to talk about it. I love you all and thank you for helping everyone.Daniel Arguin,24110,32000,24,75,290,711,4
Dylans Duck Coop / Deck Project,https://www.gofundme.com/dylans-duck-coop-deck-project,7,HUDSONVILLE,MI,You may have heard of the story of our son Dylan and his fight to keep his emotional support ducks (Nibbles and Bill). Dylan is a 13 year old high functioning Autistic boy who made national headlines this summer after some neighbors complained about his Emotional Support Animals  his ducks.  These complaints turned into a notice from the township to remove the ducks because of a zoning ordinance. However  the ducks had already been designated as emotional support animals a long time ago and Dylan’s rights were protected as such. After a lengthy process of requiring a variance and two zoning board of appeals meeting the township has outlined how Dylan can keep his ducks  in an unanimous vote of 5-0 citing overwhelming legal support. Dylan was thrilled! Once that hurdle was overcome we had to come to an agreement with the homeowners association. We are finalizing that agreement at this time and hope to finish it soon. After the township approval process people asked how they could help and some have offered to help build the coop  provide labor  etc. and we are very grateful. However  one major hurdle is that the HOA would like to see the coop placed under the back deck out of the sight of the neighbors  but we do not have any space under the current deck. So  we need to extend our deck to create more space and enclose the area underneath for Dylan  Nibbles and Bill. We will place the coop  pond  and everything they and Dylan need under the deck according to the township requirements. The problem is the cost is significant. We need to extend the deck  add stairs  install a ceiling under the deck to keep the area dry  a small pond  fencing/railings  lattice and plantings to screen the coop area  etc. And we need to do it soon as the township requires us to start coop construction right away and the weather in Michigan is starting to turn very wet. Dylan’s dad will be doing the work and a local contractor has agreed to donate his labor and expertise in building the deck. Together they will do the construction  but we could use help in buying the materials.  If you want to help in this final phase of Dylan keeping his ducks to purchase the materials needed you can donate to this cause. All proceeds will go towards the building materials needed. Donating to this cause will help Dylan enjoy a dry and secure area to spend time with Nibbles and Bill  while still meeting the township requirements for containing them.,1225,2850,9,43,24,233,6
Keri &amp; Kawika Kiesling,https://www.gofundme.com/keri-amp-kawika-keisling,1,97671,US,"Keri and Kawika Kiesling are amazing people and need our help.  They are dedicated to God and Harvest at Kumulani Chapel in Kapalua.  They serve at their church and in their community and always put others first.  It's our turn to help them in their time of need.On August 8 2017;  Kawika received a phone call that would change their families lives forever.  He was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer called Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC).  This cancer regardless of where it is hiding in the body  can prove to be very challenging due to this tumors tendency to spread along the nerve tracts.  Keri his wife couldn't believe her ears when she heard  that dreadful and very scary word \cancer\""...  none of us could.After much prayer and seeking God and His Perfect Wisdom on how to proceed in treating this cancer... rather than radiation they felt like God led them to the Gerson Therapy.  The oncologists believed radiation was the only way to prevent this cancer from killing him  but God confirmed with them that the Gerson treatment was  what they needed to do.  The Gerson Therapy™ is a natural treatment that activates the body’s extraordinary ability to heal itself through an organic  plant-based diet  raw juices  coffee enemas and natural supplements.  With its whole-body approach to healing  the Gerson Therapy™ naturally reactivates your body’s magnificent ability to heal itself – with no damaging side effects. This a powerful  natural treatment boosts the body’s own immune system to heal cancer  arthritis  heart disease  allergies  and many other degenerative diseases. Dr. Max Gerson developed the Gerson Therapy™ in the 1930s  initially as a treatment for his own debilitating migraines  and eventually as a treatment for degenerative diseases such as skin tuberculosis  diabetes and  most famously  cancer.It has been like a wild roller coaster of a ride this past year challenging every area of their lives:  financial  emotional  physically hard at times with very challenging but extreme diet changes.  But God showed Himself faithful.  Ultimately He is their provider.****Kawika needs to go back to the clinic in Mexico for two weeks in order to receive the additional treatments needed. He needs to go immediately but needs financial assistance.   It is a two year commitment to their program.  He will receive the medicine and the support he needs at this time.  The financial cost of him going back to Mexico for these treatments  continuing to do the therapy at home and  a new child on the way is NOT something they can afford on their own: But with God all things are possible and with us his friends and family we can be of great assistance.  Every little bit adds up and will help.  Won't you please donate to this wonderful family who needs our support?  And if you can't give; can you please pray for this wonderful and sweet family and Kawika's health?A big thank you from the Kiesling Ohana and his friendsfor your love and support.Aloha  Friends of the Kiesling Family.""",5258,32000,14,16,30,157,6

Kinsley&#x2019;s Spinal Cord and Scoliosis,https://www.gofundme.com/kinsleys-spinal-cord-and-scoliosis,6,LEAGUECITY,TX,We hit the road for California (26 hour drive) Oct 13th. We are very blessed that an opportunity to help Kinsley has came to light. After years of praying for Kinsley’s back  a prayer may have been answered when this place that I was not looking for fell in my lap. After speaking with 3 different moms of daughters with scoliosis and the success they have had in a short amount of time  I could not pass up the opportunity to go and help Kinsley. Kinsley will be in a 3 week treatment program in California.  We are in a bit of a rush because Kinsley is reaching skeletal maturity so any improvement will need to happen before the bones mature.  I have taken a 3 week leave from work.    Kinsley was born with T8/T9 vertebraes partially fused with a tethered spinal cord. She also developed a syrinx (cyst) inside of her spinal cord.  She had the spinal tethered cord release surgery in 2008. Last checked  she had a 46 degree scoliosis and she currently has a large right rib hump. Kinsley is not a stranger to surgery. She is considered a VACTERL child. Her first surgery was at 2 days old to connect her esophagus  detach the upper part of the esophagus from the trachea and attach it to the lower esophagus. She had 3 laryngeal cleft repairs  detethering of the spinal cord and countless small surgeries with some OR visits to have a quick look and make sure everything was okay. We are doing everything to avoid another surgery  because the back surgery would put hardware inside her and because of her tight spinal cord I’m not sure how straight they could get her back. Kinsley started being a 20 hour a day brace wearer at the age of 6. But  this has never stopped her from doing what she wants lol! Out of all all the places across the country Kinsley’s medical journey has taken us  we have never had to fork over so much cash up front.  Kinsley’s new back brace is $6500  home traction machine $7K  and $5k for each week of treatment.  Initial treatment is 3 weeks long then a week long treatment every 3 months until Kinsley is done.  Kinsley’s initial surgery was at UTMB  then the rest were performed at Tx Children’s Hospital except for the 3rd laryngeal cleft repair was at Cincinnati Children’s hospital at the airway digestive unit  she was a tough case. And one trip to NIH in Maryland to study Kinsley because she is a VACTERL child.  VACTERL is an acronym for a series of birth defects. Please pray for our safety in the car on the way there and back. We need the car to bring all of Kinsley’s equipment back. And please pray that Kinsley’s treatment is successful with no complications with the syrinx inside the spinal cord. Thank you everyone!,4869,35000,12,14,64,428,6
Elijah Ochoa,https://www.gofundme.com/elijah-ochoa,8,FREDERICKSBURG,VA,Family and Friends Augie and Rachels son Elijah has been diagnosed with a rare disease AFM that HAS NO CURE. We are asking to help our family member who is in need. Augie and Rachael are driving over an hour each way to the hospital every day (and 2 hours for when Augie is in school) which Elijah has been in for over a month. Augie is going to school and working part-time and Racheal can only work part-time due to Elijah being in the hospital. This has put a huge strain on the family. We are asking if you can help out our amazing family members who would jump if any of us needed help. Any donation will help. I have put the video link Good Morning American has done on this disease below. As you can see in the video this disease is very rare and has no cure. Please pass this along to any family member and friends. #ochoastrong Elijah is a cute six-year-old kid who has Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) which affects the nervous system causing the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Therefore  the ability to walk  stand and do simple everyday tasks has become a challenge. Even though  extensive therapy treatments in the hospital are helping there is much more progress to be made. Elijah is a kid who always is with a contagious radiating smile  his giggle fills the room with warmth and his love is so big for such a little man he can fill any void with just one hug (squeeze). Through this difficult time  Elijah has not lost his goofy spirited self and continues to fight every day to become stronger. Elijah is just one part of an amazing loving family who needs our support. Please donate to help this beautiful family through this sudden diagnosis for there are no known causes and is incurable. Elijah has been in the hospital for over a month and the medical bills and expenses are growing. Thanking you in advance.Here is the link to the news video: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-partially-paralyzed-facts-acute-flaccid-myelitis/story?id=58380831Here is a video of Elijah:,5580,10000,16,56,50,203,6

In order for him to have any chance to regain speech and/or movement he'll need to spend a significant amount of time in a skilled nursing/rehab facility.

Liver Cancer Battle,https://www.gofundme.com/supporting-our-pastor-valenzuela,3,DENVER,CO,Jesus Valenzuela is a loving husband  father of four  and has two amazing grandchildren.  If you've ever met him  you know how big his hearth and faith are. His life and the lives of all the people who love him were changed in 2014 when he was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. He underwent a major surgery to remove the cancer and was able to live a normal life but in 2017  the cancer came back and had now attacked his liver. After going through 8 months of chemotherapy  he decided to stop his treatment because he was not feeling well. Two days ago  he went to a doctor's appointment and his blood results were so bad that he had to be admitted into the hospital. His diagnosis: liver failure. Chemotherapy is not part of his treatment anymore because at this point it would be too dangerous for him. We are looking for an alternative treatment out of the country but the cost for this treatment is too high. We would love for everyone who has known him to help us reach this goal. Please keep my wonderful father in law in your prayers.Jesus Valenzuela es un esposo amoroso  tiene cuatro hijos  dos nueras y dos maravillosos nietos.

Como su higado no está funcionando como debería  la quimoterapia sería muy riesgosa para su cuerpo. Encontramos un tratamiento fuera del país pero el costo es demaciado grande. Sería una gran bendición para nosotros recaudar los fondos para que él pueda ir hasta alla y recibir el tratamiento que tanto necesita. Apreciariamos también sus oraciones. Que Dios los Bendiga!,3545,50000,9,7,37,337,6

Help Austin with Seizure Monitoring,https://www.gofundme.com/help-austin-with-seizure-monitoring,9,BIRMINGHAM,AL,Austin’s story began when he was 2 1/2 months old with what the doctor’s told me were febrile seizures. The second seizure happened a month later  resulting in being admitted for an entire week. The “episodes” started happening like clock work; in one week  out for a day and back in for a week or two. This went for the first 3 years of his life. In May of 2006  he was diagnosed with epilepsy and in November 2007  Austin was diagnosed with Dravet’s Syndrome  a severe form of epilepsy. During Austin’s 12 years of living  he’s been hospitalized over 300 times  with at least 190 being admitted in ICU  40 intubations  4 surgeries  and trial/error with numerous medications. Within the past 3 years  Austin’s seizures have gotten worse and more fatal because he now  has them while he’s sleeping  leaving high risk for SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy). The illness has caused a need for round-the-clock monitoring  detection and care  which has caused a financial burden on me  as his mother  when I have to miss work to make sure he has adequate care  while my employer’s benefits don’t cover those missed hours  days  even weeks. The need for the equipment  especially a service dog is very necessary because the older he gets the worse the seizures will get. Although there’s nothing that can be done to reduce the amount of seizures he has  I want to make sure he has everything he needs so that  even if he’s not able to do the things most pre-teens/teenagers his age do  he’ll still be around to tell his story one day.,775,10000,6,8,18,247,6
Chuck Zinzer,https://www.gofundme.com/chuck-zinzer,1,Baytown,TX,It is never easy to ask for assistance  however in times of trouble it’s all that is left.  My niece’s husband of only 2 years is in a fight for not only his life but the life he and Lindsey dreamed of since they had gotten married.  The family understand it will take a village to help them through this. This fight will prove to be a long hard fight  missing out on work  missing out on his income.  We as family and friends can help just a little.  Every dollar  every gift of time or even a meal bought or delivered  to them could help out a lot. As a Family we also are requesting that you please add Chuck and his family to your prayer list. This is Chuck’s journey so far:Earlier this year he got the diagnosis of stage 3 Esophageal cancer and along with doctors  every one of us was very hopeful that with chemotherapy and radiation would cure Chuck.  These positive vibes flew through the whole 6 weeks of treatment.  In September he was supposed to have surgery to remove the tumor.  After a little more than half the expected surgery time the surgeon gave us the not so good news.  The surgeon have found out the tumor has expanded into the omentum of the stomach and the area was too big for the surgery to remove.  He is now at stage 4 cancer and they say that there is no cure but with treatment  it will prolong Chuck’s life. We have high hopes that the chemo will work and what they say can’t be right.  Together with Chuck’s wife Lindsey they are working really hard to keep some kind of normalcy for the sake of their son. Chuck will start Chemotherapy for the second round on Monday. This fight is not over until it’s over. Thanks in advance for reading and please know there is no amount to small.  #Chuckstrong #Cancersucks,3459,15000,14,23,59,305,6
Help Eradicate Cholera in Luacjang,https://www.gofundme.com/help-eradicate-cholera-in-luacjang,7,TaylorsHill,Melbourne,Help the Community of Luacjang in Tonj State  South Sudan to eradicate Cholera Outbreak  On behalf of Luacjang community in Australia and other diaspora countries  Luacjang community are appealing for a support from general public regarding recent pandemic outbreak of cholera  in Luacjang community  in South Sudan  2017. The cholera has left a devastated effect to the Luacjang community in South Sudan and abroad.  Due to severe lack of economic development and infrastructure in Luacjang areas  the most affected regions were pastoral lands whereby many people keeps cattle for living.  However  village areas were affected by cholera outbreak with suspecting of  contaminated waterway and environmental pollution. As reported  the outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea was discovered when the news break to the community of Laucjang across the globe due to huge tragic loss of hundred lives and victims hospitalised as result of cholera virus.  There were no clinics or treatment facilities in affected areas of cholera outbreak  leaving those affected to be carried physically miles away due to lack of transportation and immediate medical attention.  Tragically  there were many confirmed cases of deaths from cholera outbreak which many victims reportedly died while being transported on-route to be rescued.   Tragically  the cholera outbreak has then left a huge vacuum in any future preventive efforts to eradicate cholera outbreak. From today  we still have ongoing cases of cholera  let alone families and community members who continued to mourned for the lost loved ones.  Therefore  there is a fear of a major return similar cholera pandemic reported in 2017  as no proper health facilities and intervention in place since the large outbreak.  Chorea is preventable disease  therefore we are appealing to the greater publics  partners and community members to assist Luacjang community raise funds  to improve on general sanitation measures of cholera prevention efforts  such as clean waterway and waste management processes  as well as medical supplies.  The primary objective is to educate cholera in affected areas.   Laucjang community in Victoria and in other diaspora countries appeals to public to support  affected Luacjang community in South Sudan for the following actions.  -  Build a health clinic in Luacjang  especially affected areas   as there are no facilities.- To equip medical officers with adequate medical supplies  sanitary equipments   and education effort to educate public on cholera eradication.- To increase essential medicines and glucose drips (dextrose)  nutritional food products to support victims in any outbreak occurrences  especially children and elderly. When cases of cholera outbreak occurs   the most vulnerable victims are the ones with low immune system and malnutrition  frail sufferers such as children  pregnant women and elderly in greater risk. Any funds generated will not be delivered to an individual or any private organisations but will go directly and carefully be handed to build and fund medical facilities . The existing humanitarian medical organisations such as Medicine Sans Frontieres (MSF)  Unicef will provide training and partnership to provide support for medical intervention  and education of Cholera eradication in Luacjang affected area.  The Account used for any funds is a community account of South Sudanese Luacjang Groups of Australian. The generated funds will be then transferred to affected Luacjang areas of Luacjang community in South Sudan.   Luacjang community in Victoria will host a fundraising event  27th of October  2018.  The event has been organised to fit similar charity cause and campaign for eridaction of Cholera in Luacjang.  We appeal to the general public to support both online and  charity campaign. Flyer will be circled soon. Great Luacjang community thanks your generosity and support for this great cause of public health prevention of morality and mortality.Account Name: Luacjang Groups of Australia IncAccount Number: 120759089  BSB:63300. Branch: Bendigo Bank,1795,50000,10,4,16,138,6
Nicole&apos;s Fight Against Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/nicoletomaino,0,HUNTINGTONBEACH,CA,To All of Nicole’s friends  our friends  family and all other caring people  Our amazing  loving  young 27 year old daughter  Nicole  was diagnosed with a blood cancer called MDS with excessive blasts on Tuesday October 2nd  2018. MDS is an aggressive Pre-Leukemia and very rare for someone of her age. We are so thankful that she pushed and pushed to be tested and tested for just about everything. For the past few months  she has said that she just knew that something was wrong. This was never expected.  Because of the level of excess blasts and how fast it could turn into AML an aggressive Leukemia (update: it did turn into AML before she checked into hospital Nov 1)   the doctors want to start Chemotherapy as soon as possible.As of now  she will be in the hospital for 4-6 weeks straight for the first round of chemotherapy  while a Bone Marrow Donor is searched for. Then   hopefully when a successful match is found  she will be back in the hospital for another 4-6 weeks for the bone marrow transplant. During this time  she will go through multiple blood transfusions  platelet transfusions and bone marrow biopsies. It is a very difficult process  as her Immune System has to basically be wiped out to get rid of the existing bone marrow and then be replaced with the new marrow. That will be another process in itself  as  the body starts its own fight to accept the transplant. She has always been the one to do whatever is needed. You don't even have to ask. She will do anything to helps others.She says she is ready for this fight. Nicole knows that she is going to lose her hair and a lot of weight during transplant.This will be a long road to recovery  as we start this  process next week  but she is very strong and staying in high hopes  as she makes it through this.Right Now   Nicole needs your help  your support and love from all!You will updated as she knows more  so that you can be with her and follow her through this all.**Please check the update links as we have posted a lot of updates over the last 2 months. Most importantly  we are done with the first in patient round that ended up being 6 full weeks because Nicole had to do a second round of chemotherapy  as the first round did not work. Unfortunately  every issue that could have happened pretty much did from the second round of chemo. She had fevers  staph running through her blood  heart failure (it is thankfully back to a normal range now)  her lungs filled with fluid and she could hardly breathe  and a small brain bleed that caused awful headaches for weeks.  The worst is hopefully behind us and she is now at home resting before heading back in on January 7th for more chemotherapy and her transplant. Thank you all for your support thus far!,13040,20000,7,65,157,2000,6

Reese&apos;s Support Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/684l2m8,0,CELINA,TX,If you have ever met Reese  you would know that he has one of the biggest personalities and hearts in this world. He is one of those people who makes anyone he meets feel like his best friend  whether he has known them for a day or for years. Reese has touched so many lives  and no matter where he goes  he leaves an impact on anyone he is around. If you know Reese well  you would also know that he is one of the most stubborn people in this world. He doesn’t take no for an answer  he stands firm in what he believes and he is always willing to voice his opinion. Just a few weeks ago  Reese started to feel ill and went to the doctor where he was diagnosed with strep throat and double pneumonia. After a few rounds of treatment that didn’t work  he went to the hospital as his symptoms failed to resolve. Within a day of arriving at the hospital  Reese was diagnosed with stage 4 carcinoma in his lungs. As you can imagine  this kind of news is something nobody is ever prepared to hear. The doctors are still trying to determine the treatment strategy they are going to take on while they try to stabilize Reese’s breathing as he has a large tumor pushing on his esophagus. He will remain in the hospital for the foreseeable future until he is able to breathe on his own once again and his body is strong enough to handle the chemotherapy. Luckily  Reese is a fighter  as he has always been  and he is ready to do whatever it takes to beat this. He also has an amazing wife and family by his side to support him and encourage him to push through this physical and emotional battle. Nobody plans to have to go through the emotional trials of such a sudden diagnosis  nor are most people prepared for the financial burden to follow. Any little bit you are able to contribute helps. If you are unable to make a financial contribution  please pray for healing and strength for everyone involved.,5440,50000,11,11,59,393,6
Double lung transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/s4xk3q-double-lung-transplant,7,CLIO,MI,Hi. My name is Becky. I'm 48 and currently in the process of being listed for a double lung transplant.  Cystic Fibrosis is a terminal disease primarily in the lungs but also can involve the digestive system and reproductive system. I was a late diagnosis at age 30 and mostly have lung involvement with a bit of digestion issues. My lungs are currently at 22% which leads me here to transplant to prolong my life. I do 9 nebulizer treatments a day. Every other month I only do 7 ;) Several pills  enzymes & vitamins . Also a 40 minute vest percussion treatment 2x a day sometimes 3 if I'm having a lung infection. I'm on 24/7 oxygen. 5-6 liters. My oxygen needs are varying according to what I'm doing or the humidity outside. I'm a dog mom of 2. Bailey is my 12 year old Jack Russell. Jack is our rescue. He's 3 a Jack Russell mix. He's a boy and truly acts like a little brother. They keep me moving forward and on my toes. I have been so blessed in life even with this horrible diagnosis. I have met some wonderful cf friends  found unknown strengths and the power of family  friends and prayers. I have a fiance  Brian.  He's my love  my Rock. He has seen me throughout my diagnosis  hospital visits   to today and our future although remains unclear  We are in high spirits I will be around for many more years with the gift of transplant. Its devastating to think someone must die for me to live. I pray for peace for donors families in making that decision. We are working on fundraising to be prepared as best we can to cover living expenses  food  gas money  bills post-transplant. Recovery is 3 weeks to several months. It completly depends on my body. Brian being one of my caregivers being off work  Normal living expenses like the hour long trip one way to the hospital  bills  copays  food  gas etc. These expenses would be significant without this fundraiser. The transplant process is invasive  physically demanding.  Our life will forever change. One being I will have to begin taking heavy doses of immunosuppressants  and a multitude of other medications for the rest of my life.  I’m looking forward to a real deep breath. I’ve never had. Imagine that.....I use less that 25% of my lungs.   All donations will go towards my medical expenses. Every little bit helps. Please I if your a praying type  I definitely can use some prayers and share with others. Through your love and support we can all help me breathe just a little bit easier.,6125,10000,3,61,5,152,6

Donna&apos;s Stem Cell Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/donna039s-stem-cell-treatment,7,SPOKANE,WA,**Note: this campaign is a surprise for Doug and Donna  so shhhhh :) **In 2017  Donna started suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis  an autoimmune disorder that affects the joints. In her case  the RA spread throughout her entire body and has caused excruciating pain in every joint. At its worst  it left Donna unable to drive  stand up  or even walk more than a few steps.She has been working for over a year to aggressively treat her RA. On top of constant doctor appointments  she has been dedicated to a very strict diet and pill regime to combat her symptoms. (Those of you who have been around her will be familiar with her regular phone alarms reminding her to take her next pills!) She had undergone a battery of tests and has endured endless trial and error to find a treatment that would address her specific case. Over the last few months of 2018  she has finally begun seeing significant progress. She is able to drive and walk and hold her grandkids again  and she was even able to ride her bike again! However  she still has a long journey of recovery in front of her.In October  she took a leap of faith and got stem cell injections. It can take several months for the effects to be felt  but the research is very promising and we're hopeful this will help restore her mobility. In order to offset the cost of this treatment  we have set up this GoFundMe campaign (as a surprise!) to support our mom as she continues her fight. Any gift will help - whether through here or via check or bank transfer! Contact Kari (kitoann@gmail.com) or Tiffany (tbost430@gmail.com) for more info.Thank you!,3275,10000,20,33,15,44,6

Gabe&#x2019;s Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/684n8js,5,BRONX,NY,On Tuesday  September 25  2018  Gabriel suffered a horrible accident. He fell from a roof 30ft high (3 stories) suffering some significant injuries to his body. His left clavicle and shoulder blade broke  elbow completely shattered and had to be replaced  his forearm and wrist shattered as well  it severed nerves and he’s lost 70% of the feeling and movement in his left hand because of it. His hip is completely broken  his left femur broke in half and was replaced with a rod  his left knee has a torn ligament  all ribs are broken and 3 surgeries so far and more surgery down the road. He will be in rehab for the next 2-3 months. Due to the severity of his injuries he will be out of work for some time. We will need to move to a wheelchair accessible home soon. Money matters have always been uncomfortable for me. I’ve had to learn to ask for help which is difficult for me. Whether it’s with the kids  or a meal  or a cab. With the long road ahead  with much advisement  and with a great deal of humility I’m reaching out to the masses. Any help is help. Everyone says I’m the strongest woman they know. I’ve had to learn that strength isn’t always doing it alone. It takes a villiage sometimes. I’ve found strength in my support system. I’ve found strength in saying “this is too much for me.” Every little bit is more than what we started with. Every little bit is generous  kind  and immensely appreciated!!!

Victoria&apos;s Kidney Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/victoria-kidney-medical-expenses,0,PHOENIX,AZ,My name is Daniel and I have a little  sister named Victoria  who is 13 years old and in the 8th grade. This past month (Sep 2018) she was diagnosed with Nutcracker Syndrome  which is a rare condition that occurs when the left renal vein (the vein that carries blood purified by the left kidney) becomes compressed and thus causing severe pain.  Victoria is my only sibling and it is so hard seeing her in so much pain. Normally when I come home to visit from college she  teases me and gets on my nerves  like little sisters do  but lately she has not had the energy.  She is very strong for her age and even when she is in so much pain she still does her best to remain positive and smile. I love her so much and it is hard to see her in so much pain especially because there is nothing I can to help ease it.  As anyone can image with any rare disease it was not an easy road even getting her diagnosed. There have been so many back and forth doctor visits and severe pain  that has affected her education. Victoria is so scared she won't be able to graduate from eighth grade in 2019 because of how much school she has missed and continues to miss.  But I believe with her strength and my support and the support of our family she will get through this.  Thank God her school has been understanding and is working with her to make up for time missed.  Victoria became ill in late August with left back pain.  Initially her first urgent care visit stated it was a pulled muscle and they sent her home. Over the next couple of weeks she was not getting better  in fact she was getting worse. Then they started looking at her kidneys and realized there was something going on there. My mom had to pressure the doctors to give her a CT Scan (at the advice of another doctor). The CT Scan showed some compression of her kidney and was then diagnosed with Nutcracker Syndrome. Next my sister was referred to nephrologist (which is a doctor that specializes in pediatrics that concerns the kidneys). That doctor wanted my sister to not only wait two years to see if she would grow out of it but also put her on pain management. My mom insisted on the nephrologist researching other options because what mom would want their 13 year on pain medication for two years. Since Nutcracker Syndrome is a rare disease there are not very many doctors that treat this condition or even know much about it let alone specialize in it with children. Her nephrologist discovered Dr. Hans Sollinger in Madison Wisconsin (the closest specialist) and  reached out to him.  After discussion with Dr. Sollinger it was determined that we would need to take Victoria to Wisconsin to be evaluated for a possible procedure where her kidney is treated by a special transplant procedure. As you can imagine this has put a financial burden on my parents.  Not only has Victoria missed a lot of school  but my mom has missed a lot of work due to all the urgent care visits  doctor appointments and caring for Victoria when she could not go to school. Although insurance may cover some costs of this procedures  it will not cover travel expenses to get out to Wisconsin. The first visit would be 3-4 days for evaluation and then possibly another visit for about a month if she does require the transplant surgery.  The money that is collected would help my parents with Victoria's medical and travel expenses to and from Wisconsin.  They are trying to seek help to assist with travel but they aren't sure how much assistance they will get or if they will even get it. I am setting up this gofundme because my parents need help and unfortunately I can't help (broke college student) so this was the one way I felt I could help them. Any help is much appreciated and thank you for allowing me to share Victoria's story.Sincerely Daniel,1795,3000,9,60,34,290,6

A Fresh Start,https://www.gofundme.com/ea7f7t-a-fresh-start,0,SANTAROSA,CA,I set up this GoFundMe page for my friend John and his wife. They're  struggling terribly to get their heads above water financially. Many of us are only a few paychecks away from homelessness or a desperate situation  and this is what happened to John's family. In his  words:“This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Reaching out for help and having to start over at 62 is not easy.“I drove trucks for about 30 years  until I was injured 2 years ago. I was renting a space from my employer for my mobile home  where my wife and I lived. When I was injured and could no longer work  we had to leave. Our home was broken into and we lost everything. My wife had to go to a shelter and I slept in the car with our dog and cat. We eventually got an apartment and things were getting better. But when I was able drive again  I was in a serious accident and when I went to DMV to renew my license  I didn’t pass one part of the test and lost my license.“My plan was always to drive until I was 70  but now all that has changed. I go to many job sites looking for labor jobs  but they look at the 30-year-old who is applying and then look at me and tell me  “We’ll give you a call.”“I’ve had to get creative and humble. I’ve made signs looking for work  and had to stand in parking lots. I’ve made some good contacts  but I’ve also been yelled at and spit at.“I’m behind on everything. I need to get even with our bills instead of just chasing them. I’m trying to get current with our rent  utilities  vehicle insurance and registration  and more. I need an eye exam and glasses to get my license back.“I’m doing this because I’m desperate. It’s hard to ask for help  but I am asking for my family. My wife is unable to work  and I have to get us out of this hole.“Whether you can help or not  I would be grateful if you could repost this. If you have any questions or concerns you can private message me on Facebook. My wife and I thank you for reading this.”,2195,6000,8,37,26,283,6

I'm really mixed on this because I'm in a terrible amount of pain up into my abdomen  as if I was just kicked  and the procedures involved could leave me infertile just as we were trying to get pregnant.This news arrived just as some very bad labs did this morning (Sat  Oct. 6th)  and I may be up against metastatic testicular cancer   while an unknown complication is inflaming my lymphatic system all the way up into my neck  seizing my back  and impairing my cognition. It's very frightening  though I know that I can beat this with my wonderful wife by my side and a little help with pursuing the best advances in medical sciences. Update 10/8/18: We have arranged for travel for my radical inguinal orchiectomy  and are heading to the Queen's ER tomorrow. The health system here has not provided any sort of treatment plan (or even completed basic testing) while my condition is deteriorating. It's pretty stressful and I hope to have some competent doctors and surgeons evaluating me within the next twelve hours.Thank you. In the past two days we have received amazing support in handling basic logistics so that we can take action and at this point all donations will be going directly towards funding all medical bills. Most importantly  perhaps to me is that your donations will help us stay focused on the healing  no matter what is required. Anis and I are grateful to everyone  and don't have better words.Thank you so much  my family so much who is emotionally behind us 100%  and most of all I thank my sweet wife for sticking by my side through this. Update 10/12/18: We have had a successful first surgery!I'm in recovery today  and the surgery couldn't have gone smoother yesterday except for having to walk around post -op  it was handled very well. I'm resting in a hotel room on Oahu  just minutes from the hospital in case of complication though can safely assure all of my supporters that you helped us to do the correct thing  and we're looking forward to learning more about the pathology in the coming weeks. Right now we don't have a good idea of what final costs will be though I thought you would appreciate knowing that we were able to pay for the hospital charge and prothesis cash  up front  before I was even put under. This was such a stress reliever  and we'll keep chipping away at the bills as they come.Thank you all so much  this has been as good of a start to such shocking turns of events that anyone could hope for  and I'm lacking better words to show my appreciation. You all ROCK! Update 10/24/18:My pathology has been confirmed to be an extremely rare form of cancer known as Spermatocystic Seminoma. While the odds are amazingly low of contracting this disease--about one in 3.3 million men per year are diagnosed with it--the good news is that it's highly treatable.We are in limbo here at 13 days post-op and still have not received helped for oncology. The medical system here is really that bad off. What we hope will happen today is that I'll get scheduled with an oncologist who can officially stage my cancer  and formulate the complete treatment plan. This may involve chemotherapy and radiation therapy  or if we're very lucky it might just be monitoring and testing for five years to declare being completely healed.I'm still very uncomfortable in my groin and I'm nauseated  running a constant low-grade fever  and have no appetite. I've lost 28lbs in the past five weeks. We had to go out of our way to get treatment for pain management  and are staying at home with ice packs and resting as much as possible. The surgery site is healing well  and we're really looking forward to getting some answers soon.Thank you again to everyone who's helped in any way as this has been a terrifying and excruciating experience  and unfortunately this might just be the beginning of the journey. We'll keep you posted with the data as it arrives.Update 10/26/18:We've finally been seen by the oncology team of North Hawaii Community Hospital and further tests have confirmed the success of my first surgery. I've officially been diagnosed as stage 1 and at this point will need CT scans and lab work for the next three years to confirm that there is no metastases  and after three years they will be able to declare my cancer cured.THANK YOU  and if you're able to make any contributions or share this campaign with someone please do as we're beginning to get hit with the bills that we haven't already paid for from the past month's ordeal. This sucks of course and I'll be able to work we think by late November  so every drop helps us to maintain a normal lifestyle during this healing phase.Peach and Aloha to you all Carl and Anis Miller,10485,25000,10,42,78,587,6
Help Thea walk again,https://www.gofundme.com/helptheawalkagain,0,HuntingtonStation,NY,Help Thea walk Again Meet Thea  She was born with Periventricular Leukomalacia(brain damage)  Cerebral Palsy Spastic Diplegia  and Microcephaly. She suffers from Epilepsy(seizure disorder)  ADHD  Developmental Delay and was recently diagnosed with Autism. At 21 Thea has been a fighter since birth against all these odds… Until now.￼Back StoryMy name Julie Bell and I’m Thea’s mom. It’s been just us for the past 21 years. She is my best friend  my hero  my whole world. Throughout all our years of struggles Thea has always remained strong. She’s a happy  helpful  loving and caring  fun and funny young lady.  A few of Thea’s favorite things to do were sing with her friends  dance  in her own special way and creating things Like jewelry  picture frames and phone cases. Thea was due to exit high school in June 2017.  So I applied for the necessary and much needed therapies along with the post high school placement services  3 years prior. However to date nothing has ever been put into place. Thea got turned down for work program earlier in the year because of her low IQ and inability to understand or follow directives. So it was quite clear that she would never be able to work on her own.Then suddenly  3 months prior to school’s end Thea became severely ill. She became very confused and lethargic. A few days later she could not talk  or walk was not eating or sleeping  began throwing up  and running a fever. She complained of loud piercing sounds in her head  severe pain and then went blind in one eye. Because of her cognitive mentality she didn’t understand what was going on and was so afraid. I felt helpless  Initially I thought she was having a stroke. I was terrified. I thought I was going to loose her. A mother‘s worst nightmare.At the hospital they did every kind of test imaginable but they had no diagnosis. I took her to private doctors  Specialists  they repeated and did additional tests; but still no explanation as to what and why this is happening. Medications were stopped  changed  new ones added. Which had only made her feel worse.Now 7 months later. We still have no answers and she still needs more tests. Her vision is back  but the migraines and pain is torture. Thea still can’t walk on her own and is now total care  from washing/toileting to dressing/walking  everything. I can no longer work. Requiring complete and constant full time home care and part time nursing care has depleted all my resources already. How you can helpYour generous donations no matter how small will go directly to helping Thea get her life back. Thea see’s three specialists and more medical tests are needed to help diagnose or treat her illness. Right now she needs Physical therapy treatments to help get her to walk again. Anything else will go to in-home nursing care  medication  medical bills and to help her relearn her basic ADL’s self care  hygiene  and safety precautions. The fear  frustration and confusion in her eyes replaced that carefree sparkle. She’s just a totally different girl. With your help Thea will be able to get the help she so desperately needs. We are so very grateful to everybody who is considering donating however we understand if you can not and thank you so much for reading about Thea. We would just like to ask if you would please share our Gofundme link with your friends and family and people in your social media. Your support means so much to both of us. Thank you and God Bless.My Hope for her futureIdeally she would be in a daily program where she will be able to meet  interact with  and develop friendships with other people and become an asset to the community.,619,4500,14,14,6,30,6

I have a beautiful  normal family; my husband Anthony and I have been married for 22 years. We have 2 kids  Miguel is 21 and Victoria is 16.November of 2017 changed our lives forever; our future was stolen. My dreams of growing old with my best friend  to walk our daughter down the aisle someday and raising grand babies together came to a screeching halt when we heard the doctor say  \I'm sorry Anthony  I'm afraid you have ALS\"".Wait  what? What is ALS? How does this happen? Why does this happen? This can’t be happening  he’s only 46. How do we tell the kids? What are we going to do? I had never had so many questions or experienced so many emotions at once. All this while swallowing my tears  keeping my cool  and telling him everything would ok.Through this journey  Tony has shown us what real courage looks like. He never complains  he has never asked the question why me or gotten angry at his inability to perform the most basic of tasks. His faith in God and the love he has for his family and friends give him the determination to continue this fight.For people living with ALS and their caregivers  every day can have a stressful event. This has been the case for us in the past few weeks. With the inevitable progression of the illness  Tony has now lost the ability to walk and needs a motorized wheelchair. The ALS Association is ready to provide it but are unable to as we lack the proper means of transportation. Your donation will help us get a van that will help us transport Tony in his much-needed wheelchair. This will help him participate in his daily life and help us continue to give Tony the best quality of life we can  because he deserves it.Every time we ask ourselves how we are going to get through things  our answer is very simple  \""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"" -Philippians 4:13Other ways to help:-Buy a t-shirt or mug to support the ALS Association (t-shirts) or to support the funds for the van (mug)              T-shirts:  https://teespring.com/tony-s-angels-can-t-steal-my#pid=2&cid=2122&sid=back              Mugs:  https://teespring.com/tonys-angels-mug#pid=658&cid=102908&sid=front -Donate to our team for the ALS Association walk:               http://web.alsa.org/site/TR?px=7809566&pg=personal&fr_id=13382&s_src=boundlessfundraising&s_subsrc=bfIphFbPpMypg-Learn more about ALS  educate a friend  and donate to the ALS Association:               http://www.alsa.org/""",6670,20000,9,33,69,613,6

Vu is a very hard working  responsible   loving and outgoing person.  He doesn't like to sit around.  A very dedicated husband/father of 3  we have a son and 2 daughters.  Being sick is not an option for him  but unfortunately his body won't cooperate.This is not something we ever imagine doing...asking for help...but with the current situation.....I am asking for anything that would help.

Support Jules with brain surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/brain-surgery-recovery-for-jules,0,Naremburn,NSW,I am usually the one rushing to people’s sides and offering love  support and assistance. I have always been of the mindset that if I have it  I can share it or give it. Now I find myself having to write my story and reach out to friends  colleagues and the greater universe as I am in need of support as I prepare for brain surgery on the 6th Dec 2018.I am a single Mum with a little boy who is just 2 years old.  Unfortunately  my partner passed away just a few weeks before our son Madin was born.  The last couple of years have been tough but nowhere near as tough as the last 5 months as I face life-threatening health issues and prepare for brain surgery.  Here is a little of my story:  In August 2018  I presented to Emergency with stroke symptoms. I was referred to the Stroke Clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital  Sydney.  During the consultation with the Professor and while looking at my brain scans there was an incidental find of three intracranial (brain) aneurysms.  Left side: 1 x 8mm and 1 x 4mm. Right side: 1 x 2mm.  Anything over 7mm is deemed at high risk of rupture and surgery is recommended.   There are many causes for aneurysms and mine could be hereditary as my Great Grandfather passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage. Aneurysms are present in about 2% or more of the adult population and multiple aneurysms occur in 10% of these.  A cerebral aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the wall of the brain artery.  They are more common in women than in men.  * Source: Brain Foundation AustraliaSince the first hospital visit  I have presented to Emergency another two times with stroke symptoms.  On one of those occasions  I was admitted to the stroke ward for several days and I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder  on top of the aneurysm diagnosis.  I have had some other incidental finds and I am currently experiencing a very high white blood cell count and platelets that have been rising now for 2 months. I am waiting to be given an appointment with a haematologist and oncologist at RNSH. I sadly cannot afford to see a private specialist.I have opted for a craniotomy and clipping for my 8mm aneurysm.  The clipping option is usually favoured in younger patients as it gives a more permanent solution and a longer life expectancy.  For those of you who don't know what this is  here is a little explanation (I hope it doesn't make you queasy).An incision will be made behind my hairline  then a section of the skull bone is removed.  This gives access to the lining over the brain. The lining is then opened to expose the brain surface.  Under a microscope  the aneurysm is carefully separated from the normal blood vessels and the brain. The metal clip (like a clothes peg) is attached to the neck of an aneurysm.  This keeps blood from entering the aneurysm.  As a result  future bleeding is prevented  and the brain tissue is protected from further damage.  The bone plate will be securely put back into place using thin metal plates and screws and the wound is closed.  The metal plates and the clip will remain in my head permanently although the bone plate will heal over 6-12 months.   They can only operate on one aneurysm at a time as it would increase the surgery risks  which are: * Stroke. * Loss of sight in my left eye. * As language sits on the left-hand side of the brain  there is a risk of loss of language – this means speaking  reading  writing  typing.  Lastly  temporary loss of memory. The risk of not having the surgery is much higher  as the neurosurgeon’s words to me were that a rupture would be catastrophic for me.  I have been on a waitlist for just over 60 days and I received my surgery date today 6/11.  The operation will be on the 6th Dec 2018  which is just a month away   This time will fly by and before I know it  it will be time to face the fear of such a serious operation.My recovery will be long  if there are no complications during the surgery or after the surgery  my recovery will hopefully look similar to this:·     1 week stay in hospital (ICU and stroke ward).  I will be released from the hospital just 2 weeks before Christmas. ·     6 weeks of bed rest  where I will need help to look after my son  and myself.  I will need to have rehab and I will have Neuro Fatigue as my brain recovers from the surgery. This can be ongoing for up to a year. ·     At 3 months  I can hopefully look for some part-time work  ideally 1 x 4-hour days for 6 weeks and build up to 2 half days and so on.  ·     Within 6 months to 1 year I should be fully recovered and working full time again. Unfortunately  I am not out of the woods with this one brain surgery as I have three aneurysms and I will have to carefully watch the two that remain. This will require some lifestyle changes to reduce stress and situations that could increase rupture risk. I will be looking for treatments that could perhaps help me shrink the two that remain. It is rare  but it can happen. I really do not want to face brain surgery another two times.  (Aneurysms grow on average at 1mm a year). For those of you that know me  you know I live my life to the fullest. I go after my dreams and I am full of love for everyone.  I am warm and friendly  and I am always ready to help others.  I can be cheeky and love to have a good laugh.  I always look for the positives in situations and I am a strong  independent woman. I can say with my hand on my heart that the finding of these aneurysm has hit me hard and I have been on an emotional rollercoaster.    My biggest achievement in life is my son Madin.  I never thought that I would get the chance to be a Mum and in my mid 40’s the universe gifted me with the most beautiful little boy.  He is my life  he is my power  he is my world and I cannot leave him. He is just 2 years old and I would give and try anything to ensure that I am healthy and able to be the strong  healthy Mumma he deserves.  The love I have for Madin is beyond belief and seeing Madin’s little face every day is what keeps me going.   I am reaching out on this platform to ask for help as I am not able to work right now or for some time in the near future. Knowing that I could potentially reduce some of the immense financial pressure I am facing will help to reduce high levels of stress  which can potentially increase rupture risk.  To have some financial pressure released will give me the chance to fully focus on my upcoming surgery and my recovery.  It will give myself and Madin the support we both need to get through this.   Anything you can spare to help us will be gratefully received. The donations will come directly to myself and Madin and will help me cover medical and daily living expenses. As I have just been given my surgery date and my surgery is now only a month away  the need is quite timely.  I would ideally like to get some very important things into place for myself and Madin before I am not able to do some of those things myself.   Thank you for taking the time to read my story and for any support you can contribute either financial or other  I will certainly pay it forward in the future and I am truly grateful.Much Love Jules and Madin xxx,28759,85000,17,34,266,1000,5

I lost my mom to cancer  a month later I lost my job and the week after that I had a stroke. While still in the hospital I started my SSDI. After a 3 year fight I finally got approved  but not before the bills pilled up. My wife was the only one working (and still is) at the time. At the time we did what we had to cut corners and shave the bills down to the bare necessities like electricity  heat  a roof over our heads and food  both my wife and myself went without things like food and meds to make sure my special needs step son had what he needed.We tried many time to get help like food stamps  heating assistance  only to be told we had to high of an income at $25 000 for a family of three. During this time we maxed out our credit cards  missed bills  blew off the collectors for medical bills.Currently I am trying to get working again  but with my limitations having a hard time. I’m hoping to get working soon  but we have used up our saving and cashed in what we could. We are just to tapped out  because of the credit cards and old bills we have ruined our credit and can not get a loan to help. We have received the help that our families could give us. We have just run out o options so 5 years latter we are turning to this to see what help we can get.Thank you for taking the time to read this  and a very big thank you if you can help.,275,10000,15,3,5,23,6

Help for Helen,https://www.gofundme.com/vad76x-help-for-helen,8,CLIFTONPARK,NY,Helen is a dear friend of mine who was recently diagnosed with Small Cell  Lymphoma  and Leukemia. Shortly after her diagnosis she lost both of her jobs and she is unable to get out of her lease at the apartment complex she lives in. She does receive social security but that only covers her rent and none of her other expenses  hence her trying to get out of her lease. Helen is a widow who does not have anyone to help sustain her financially and is piling on debt due to multiple tests and medical procedures and lack of work.  She needs her car to get her to her appointments  and hopefully more future jobs  so she doesn’t want to lose her car. Helen has worked hard her entire life  holding multiple jobs up until just recently when she was “let go”  both stating it was not due to her illnesses. Helen has put her trust in Jesus and knows that everything will work out for the good and according to his purpose because she loves him.  This is such a trying time for her. Not only does she have to live  fight  and heal from her multiple illnesses  she now has to deal with the stress of excessive debt and not being able to work.  She would never ask anyone for help.

Punch This Cancer Right In The Face,https://www.gofundme.com/685azb4,0,NORTHMYRTLEBEACH,SC,On September 11  2018 my dog Dejah and I evacuated Wilmington NC due to a hurricane that was slowly headed our way. Instinct told me to drive south towards Savannah Georgia. We ended up staying there and making a fun road trip out of it. 6 days later we decided it was time to head back north towards Wilmington to beat all the rising water. My mother lives in North Myrtle Beach so we headed to her home and arrived there safe and sound. With all the lifting I had to do with Dejah i had hurt my back. Within 48 hours I couldn’t walk or move. I had to call an ambulance to come rescue me and they took me to McLeod Seacoast Hospital in Little River.  After asking me questions they concluded without any tests that it was a slipped disk. Because of the time and staffing they wanted me to come back the next day at 8am to get an MRI. With my knowledge and background of Massage Therapy I knew it was more than just a slipped disk. I asked if they could atleast do a Ct scan and they agreed thank goodness. They had given me a shot of morphine and the morphine didn’t do anything. After the Ct scan came back all vibes and energy changed. They found a large mass growing on my left lung and legions in my vertebrae. They admitted me into the hospital and I stayed there for 6 days. I received 2 Ct scans  2 MRIs  EKG test  and a bone scan. I have been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer that’s metastasized and it’s leaking into my vertebrae  right sternum  left and right ribs and right pelvic bone. Just like that my life changed and all I can do now is embrace this new journey and fight for my life. I’m 37 and a non smoker and I live my life as holistically as possible. The doctors are all so confused with my case and they are doing their absolute best to try and help me. I started radiation treatments on October 3 and will have a total of 11 rounds of radiation treatment. The goal of the radiation is to help reduce the pain in my bones and the bones can start to regenerate and grow back strong and healthy. They are still coming up with a plan for the lung cancer. For now I’m focused on the radiation treatments. Taking it minute by minute and making sure my diet and water intake is the best it can be. My job is healing right now and I’m unable to drive or work. Anything and everything will help me  thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I do live Facebook updates and I also have been inspired to donate bears to everyone I encounter on this new chapter of my life. #bearsforemily #punchthiscancerrightintheface peace and love forever,1150,5000,8,23,24,249,6

Medical Funds for Renny Taiugmai,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-funds-for-renny-taiugmai,5,HONOLULU,HI,Families and Friends              This is a campaign to raise funds for Renny's medical expenses.  Renny Glenn Taiugmai  a vibrant young man  was involved in a car accident that happened on October 3rd in Hawaii.  Renny is a young man  who still has his whole life ahead of him.  He is one that always brings laughter and joy to the people around him.   If you've known Renny  you'll know that he likes to make fun of himself  and laughs with you  even though you're laughing at him.    He goes out of his way to make the people around him feel happy.               On the night of the accident  he got off from work late and was picked up by friends as they make their way home.  The driver lost control of the car as they were on the freeway and smashed into the guardrails.  Renny was in the backseat of the car  and got ejected upon impact  and has been in coma since.  Although he also had rib fracture and other injuries to his body and limbs  the main concern for now is his brain injuries.  He underwent craniectomy  removal of part of the skull  to ease pressure from the brain swelling  and is still in critical condition as of now.  He is on life support  and we were told by the doctor that it will take time  as he heals  to know more about his chance of a full recovery  and so we remain optimistic.              Renny came to Hawaii for school on his own  and learned to live on his own at a very young age  without his immediate family.  He doesn't have health insurance  and because he is not a US citizen  he does not qualify for the medicaid program.   We will not know the exact amount of his expenses until later in the recovery period  and so I am putting up a conservative estimate so that we can be able to edit as we get more information.  No amount of contribution is too small - when you give something  it is from the heart  even if its just prayers  we will be very much grateful.,5706,8000,6,71,64,962,6

Held Family Helping Hand,https://www.gofundme.com/held-family-helping-hand,0,HILLSBOROUGH,NJ,On July 10th my husband Paul was diagnosed with cancer. He was able to work until August  but then the treatments got to be too much and he had to go out on disability. We knew it would be tough to make ends meet while he wasn’t working  but we had two months worth of savings  and disability usually takes 4-6 weeks to kick in  so we thought we’d be okay. Unfortunately  the oncologist’s office dropped the ball and never submitted their portion  and Paul was denied disability. After a lot of yelling  and a few tears  I did get the doctor’s office to fax over the documentation.  After a week  I checked with the state  and now they don’t even have his ssn on file  so I’m afraid I have to start over from scratch. I realize  when this disability mess finally gets sorted out  the 70% pay will be retroactive  but in the meantime  I don’t know how we are going to make ends meet. I’ve cut out all non-essential items (like taking collision off our ten year old car and insurance on our phones). I’ve contacted all our utilities to see if I could get our payments lowered at all  but we still have roughly $3 700 in monthly bills and less than $600 a month coming in from my part-time job. (I have been looking for a full time job since May  but no luck yet.)For those of you who know me  you know how hard it is for me to even admit I need help  let alone ask for help - I’m always the one helping others  and I figure out our own messes on my own; but this time I realize I can’t do it on my own...When the disability does kick in  any extra money I can squeeze out of the budget will go to our mounting medical bills (which are not calculated in the monthly amount above  and neither is the student loan payments which are supposed to start in November - but I’m hoping I’ll be able to find a full time job by then). Paul’s chemo and radiation are done  and the lastest scan does show the tumors have shrunk  so our next step is a consultation with a surgeon.  Depending on what he says  the next several months may consist of surgery  recovery and rehabilitation  or if the tumor is still inoperable  then he’ll have a year or two of immunotherapy.  No matter what  we still have a long road ahead of us.**In an effort of full disclosure  I did want to let everyone know we did qualify for charity care at the hospital  but that does not cover everything. Every time he has to go to the ER  only half his bill is waved  every X-ray  CT  MRI  PET scan is 70% or 80% covered (I can’t remember)  Radiation treatments were covered at 90%. I have no idea what the oncologist’s bills are going to be because they haven’t sent one yet  and we haven’t met with the surgeon yet  so I don’t know how that will work either. All the doctors who come to see him while he’s in the hospital or consult with his doctors all bill separately at varying if any discount. Prescriptions aren’t covered at all and they have ranged from $9-$200 a pop. So although we are EXTREMELY blessed not to have to bear the full brunt of the medical bills  even a percentage of an astronomical bill is still a hefty sum. I just wanted to be completely transparent...,18765,25000,15,75,203,969,6

Any donation would mean the world and help pay for medications and treatments. Thank you for your prayers  love and support in this difficult time. Any amount  no matter the size would be extremely helpful.I have chosen alternative medicine and natural options  both of which are expensive  because these medical treatments are not covered by the healthcare system and/or insurance.I struggle to believe in the conventional \poison-burn-cut\"" treatment that has not proven to cure this terrible disease called CANCER.Through my research  I believe my best odds are in the direction I have taken. My body is responding well to what I have started; it would be a shame to stop now.I have  used up my savings and I'm not done with my treatments. Any support is greatly appreciated and would alleviate some of the financial burden of my next round of treatment.I thank you from the bottom of my heart.""",1209,5000,11,24,26,180,6
MeganThimmes Breast Implant Illness,https://www.gofundme.com/meganthimmes-breast-implant-illness,0,LANCASTER,OH,In life  we go through seasons...some good and some that we wish we never had to face. The good ones  we love to showcase to the world. Facebook  Instagram  social circles  friends  family...we celebrate our wins  our blessings  and the many challenges we overcome. The lows  however  we often seek to hide in fear of what others might think or say about us. In a world where we all have burdens and struggles  somehow we think we are the only one who has them. Those of you who know me know the importance I place on living a natural {some may call it “crunchy”} lifestyle  free from toxic ingredients and contaminants. I do all I can to have a body that is a picture of health. This includes what I eat  drink  clean with  bathe with  what I will not allow on or in my body  etc. I truly believe that our bodies are a temple and that God has given us plants as food to consume and use as “natural” medicine  and therefore I strive to live life accordingly. I have not always lived this way. However  despite my efforts to maintain a healthy body in the recent years  during the past year  I have become the very person I described above. The one in the valley. The low season that I try desperately to hide from social media and everyone around me. The sick one.In December 2017  I began having joint pain in my knees and my hands/fingers. I noticed it the most when I would be doing a lot of getting up and down...usually when playing with the boys  cleaning  exercising  or doing outdoor activities such as hiking. I also developed anxiety that would get increasingly worse with time. Shortly after (right around Christmas)  I developed a horrible rash around my mouth. Me being the avid researcher I am  I began trying to figure out what was causing it. Naturally  no pun intended  I sought out non-toxic options to try to rid this rash. It cracked  bled  burned  and itched. NOTHING helped. Within days  I experienced extreme itching and burning all over my body when water (warm or cold) would touch my skin...the most excruciating being on my face. This continued for weeks as I sought to figure out what was going on with my body. Through all of this  I was still breastfeeding our third baby who was born in June 2017. Our breastfeeding journey was difficult  but I was determined to stick it out. I battled round after round of painful blocked milk ducts on a weekly basis. Nevertheless  I chalked it up to hormonal changes  and persevered. Some of you may remember a Facebook post I made back in the spring of this year about a reaction I had to a new mattress we bought. I broke out in hives from head to toe within minutes of the mattress being in our home. In June  I began having sharp shooting pains in my chest  exhaustion  worsened joint pains  and heavy breathing. The rashes around my mouth got to the point where I was embarrassed to be in public and more rashes developed around my eyes. My outward appearance was noticeably different by this time (July-ish)  with dark circles and bags under my eyes  as well as red splotches  cracks  and peeling all around my mouth  nose  and eyes. People noticed  and whether they said sometime or not  I could tell what they were thinking. Bruises covered my legs and a bloody nose came frequently. I could no longer put any makeup on my face. Taking a shower was unbearable. Eating came with its own anxiety  knowing the pain and itching that would inevitably come within minutes of finishing a meal. GI issues  stomach pains  back pain  chest pain  joint pain...the list seemed and seems to grow every day. I questioned  prayed  researched...what could possibly be wrong?? I do everything “right”  but  somehow  nothing I was eating or doing was helping. I was getting worse by the day. This whole time  I had an idea of what could be causing all of this  but I didn’t want to believe it. I had heard of this happening to people  but was this supposed “fake illness” (referred to by most of the medical community) really what I was experiencing? Flash back to 2014. Many of you know my story; many others don’t. In 2014  my husband and I were divorced. ((Hallelujah- we were remarried in 2015!)) Through emotional highs and lows and a pregnancy early in our first marriage  I was left with a negative self-image. Unfortunately  the world we live in profits off of insecurities in women like me. It displays picture “perfect” women at every store front  in every magazine  and (lets be honest) on every social media news feed. We sit in traffic next to billboards displaying these “enhanced” women and words like “FREE consultation” or “Get the body you’ve always dreamed of” draw us in. Ladies  you know exactly what I’m talking about. Instead of seeing ourselves through the eyes of our Creator  we view ourselves through a distorted lens filled with lies and deception. I could make myself happy again. Right? So  I went and did the one thing that I had control over. I got breast implants  free consultation and all. I’ve never had issues with my implants. I was happy with them. They gave me back what I thought I was lacking after having a baby and breastfeeding. I was so happy with them  I (now regretfully) recommended many people to the surgeon I had at the time. At the time of the consultation  pre-op appointment  or post-op appointment  I was never advised of potential side effects. I was never given any information regarding previous lawsuits  diseases  cancers  or illnesses that commonly presented in women who elected to have these implants  including specifically those who had my exact brand and type of implant. Nonetheless  I was the proud new owner of Mentor silicone breast implants. What I did not know was that these “safe” implants contain a plethora of neurotoxins  hormone disrupters  heavy metals  or to put it simply- death in silicone. I was told that these implants were SAFE to have if pregnant or nursing  when the truth is that the very own 42 page package insert for my implants (that I was never given nor do patients ever receive or hear about) says that they are  in fact  CONTRAINDICATED in BOTH *pregnancy* and *nursing*. The package insert also states that ruptures are LIKELY to happen and that these ruptures are initially silent and therefore routine MRI’s are advised beginning at 3 years post-op (I’m now almost 5 years & two pregnancies/breastfed babies post-op) and continued every two years thereafter. Furthermore  I was not told that these implants were associated with documented  likely & increased risk of developing lymphadenopathy  granulomas  connective tissue diseases such as RA  fibromyalgia and lupus  brain cancer  stomach cancer  breast cancer  cervical cancer  infertility  neurological diseases  lymphoma  leukemia  or a laundry list of other autoimmune and hypersensitivity issues. Breast. Implant. Illness. Say it with me. This is not fake. It’s not something women make up. It’s not something to joke about or make a live video criticizing the women who have it. I thought it wasn’t real too. Until it happened to me. I had heard of Facebook groups specifically for these crazy women with the supposed “Breast Implant Illness”. For the 55 000+ women in those groups  I’m sorry. I’m sorry for thinking it was a joke. I’m sorry I was too prideful of the fact that “I was healthy” to recognize the likely potential detrimental health consequences that accompany implants. No one should ever have to go through this. Many days  I’d rather sleep until I can wake up free from the pain  itching  and burning that consumes my face  head  and other parts of my body. I wish I could eat without fear of the reaction I’m going to have afterword. I long for the day I can get in the shower and actually let water touch my face  instead of having to hold a towel over my face with one hand while I wash my hair with the other. I look forward to the day I’m able to hold my boys again without getting completely winded...or be able to jump up and down without feeling like my knees are going to give out. I pray for the day I’m actually able to kiss my husband on the lips again...because I haven’t been able to do that without horrendous pain in months. By the grace of God  I was able to meet with a surgeon who is a believer in Breast Implant Illness. Through our exams and discussions  it’s been concluded that I am indeed suffering from silicone toxicity due to capsular contracture and ruptured “leaking” implants. I’ve been told that MANY women begin to have similar issues that I am having along with other illnesses or diseases mentioned above after having babies. My surgeon says I am a “textbook” case of Breast Implant Illness based on my history  timeline of symptom occurrence  and the fact that I carried  delivered  and breastfed two babies back to back. My immune system  having been all but destroyed from these TOXIC death bags on top of providing for two babies through pregnancies and breastfeeding  has crashed. I’m showing markers for multiple connective tissue diseases and autoimmune disorders and am having uncontrollable hypersensitivity reactions daily. So  what does this mean? First  I have to have surgery. Quickly. The procedure I need to have is a total (en bloc) capsulectomy which means he will remove both the implants and the surrounding scar tissue. It is a rather lengthy and invasive surgery  as my implants are under the muscle and the scar capsule has multiple critical points of attachment. After surgery  the tissue will then be sent to pathology to test for irregular cell growth as well as mold. The Mentor implants I have have been yielding disturbingly highly lymphoma rates which is a concern explant surgeons have with patients like myself who have this brand. He does believe that the silicone has leaked outside of the scar tissue capsule given the severity of my symptoms  so after surgery I will begin a rather intense detox regimen to rid my body of any leftover silicone or other heavy metals. Unfortunately  we have been unable to get this covered by insurance thus far  and I am unable to have the surgery unless the entire cost is paid in full PRIOR to the procedure. The cosmetic surgery industry is a BIG BUSINESS. Because of that  explanting due to Breast Implant Illness is very difficult to get coverage for.  The cost of surgery is $7 000.Throughout this journey  this dark season of life  I’ve come to realize just how much of a prideful person I am. It’s not pretty admitting your faults  but going through the process of the Refiner’s Fire is where true beauty is found. Not only did I take pride in my looks (its amazing how humble a face rash that resembles leprosy will make you) but I also realized just how prideful I am when it comes to having to ask others for help. It’s easy to judge someone’s situation from the outside  but when you are on the other side crying out to God for help  your whole perspective changes. The truth is  a few years ago  we would have had no problem coming up with the $7 000 for surgery. Three kids  multiple heart surgeries for Luke  chiropractic school  and downsizing life to minimize monthly bills later and we truthfully have no way to pay for it. We’ve prayed  day after day  and we keep hearing the same answer. “Ask for help.” But- my pride. “Ask for help.” So  as one of the most difficult  humbling things I’ve ever had to do in my life  I’m asking all of you...my family  friends  school friends  Facebook friends  brothers and sisters in Christ  acquaintances  fellow crunchy/awareness raising mamas  or anyone who is a past Breast Implant Illness survivor ...if you would consider contributing even a small amount to help me get these ridiculous implants out...no words could ever express my gratitude. I’ve set up a GoFundMe with the help of my mom that I will link in the comments and in my bio if you feel led to help. I plan to pay for and schedule surgery immediately upon having the needed funds. If you are not able to support financially  we serve a good Father  who I am fully trusting for complete financial provision and healing of which we would also be incredibly grateful for your joined prayers. Lastly  October is Breast Cancer Awareness month. It’s no debate that many women today get breast implants following having had this terrible disease. I’m blessed to not have had this as the underlying reason for my implants. Nonetheless  I  like many others  got breast implants to enhance my physical appearance. I pray that my words have been helpful to someone out there contemplating getting implants. My hope and prayer is that all women will see themselves as beautiful  regardless of size  shape  appearance  or rash-covered face  and that we stop believing the lies that we need to implant toxic garbage bags under our skin to make us beautiful or desirable. Had I known then what I know now  I NEVER...N E V E R would have gotten breast implants.Please share this message with your loved ones!!! I wish I would have known the truth about breast implants before I made the decision to get them. Knowledge is power! Share this with your friends  moms  daughters  aunts  grandmas  nieces  sisters  wives  girlfriends. This has been a very long  tiring process. I’ve learned so much  and am a completely open book.

Unfortunately  life happens and my parents are in a spot where some financial help would relieve a lot of stress with the medical bills rolling in and my mom not being able to work. My mom was diagnosised with breast cancer over a year ago and did all the treatments recommended and was able to ring the bell at the roger maris cancer center. This summer after falling a couple times and cognitively not being all there she was taken to the E.R. And we got the news that she had stage four brain cancer with two tumors.  Our worlds haven’t been the same since. They were able to get one of the tumors in surgery and radiated the other one. She’s been through hell and back.My mom  is a nurse at Sanford and has been helping delivery babies for many years  she is the most caring and motherly human I’ve ever met. She always puts everyone else first and that hasn’t stopped. After her intense and very difficult brain surgery (due to size and location in brain) our family walked in to see how she was doing and the first thing she asked was how all of us were doing.

Garrett has a heart of gold and has been volunteering to help neighbors and family with recovery efforts from hurricane Florence. Recently  Garrett has been diagnosed with a moderate to severe form of pectus excavatum. With this medical condition  he will have surgery called the Nuss Procedure. During this procedure  the medical team will place a metal bar in his chest cavity to expand the area for his heart and lungs. This summer Garrett and his mom Tina will have to travel to Massachusetts to have this medical procedure done.  He will be hospitalized for 5-7 days and will be required to remain in Massachusetts until he is cleared to travel home  about 7 days after he leaves the hospital.  Tina will face many costs associated with Garrett having this medical procedure.  She will have to stay in a hotel for at least 14 days in Massachusetts.  Garrett will not be allowed to travel via airplane so Tina will have to rent a reliable vehicle to travel to and from Massachusetts incurring travel expenses.  Another expense she will have is for food while there.  Tina is also having copay and out of pocket expenses for medical visits leading up to Garrett's surgery.  If we could all help Tina by donating any amount it would be greatly appreciated as she is a single mom carrying a big load.,490,5000,15,10,9,44,6

Carin&#x2019;s Fight,https://www.gofundme.com/carins-fight,6,MANTON,MI,Carin has been in a 3 year fight to overcome an infection that was hindered by mesh that was used for a hernia years ago. They did not just use a little mesh it was double layered across her whole abdominal area.  After several surgeries and living on a pic line for almost 1 1/2 years  the local doctors and surgeons could not fix what was going on and referred her to the Mayo Clinic. She has since made 6 trips out there from Michigan and will need to make about 6 more before this is finished. She is retired and her insurance will only cover so much. The last stay was 15 days  that is 15 days at a motel for her husband  gas  and meals  and prescriptions that her insurance wont cover. The last one was $1000.00. She is making good progress with the treatments and surgeries at Mayo but the expenses are adding up and she really needs a miracle to be able to keep the schedule the surgeons have laid out in her care plan. Before all of this came to be this woman swam 100 miles at the YMCA. She is very fit for a 70 year old which has helped her complete the rigorous schedule of surgeries to  regain her health but we have a ways to go. She has used all of her savings everything is maxed out. Your donation will allow her to finish the fight  and have victory... she is so close.  Thank you for considering us.

Help Roger who has helped so many,https://www.gofundme.com/help-roger-who-has-helped-so-many,7,PITTSBURGH,PA,"For decades  Roger Stewart has spent his life in the service of others. He began when he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Years later  he followed his passion  and went back to school to work in the health care field.  Whether it's been with pain  chronic ailments  or life altering diseases  he has strived to improve the health of family members  friends and patients. He has freely shared his knowledge  actively sought out answers  and selflessly given his time to provide relief to anyone seeking his advice.Several years ago  as he neared retirement  he began to notice problems with his own health. The diagnosis turned out to be cancer and Lyme’s disease. One doctor's prognosis was that he \might have about 6 months.\"" In true \""Roger\"" fashion  he began to search for answers  only this time  for himself. As usual  he does not complain  no matter how he feels. Fortunately  the treatments that have been implemented over the last few years have helped in his battle and have proven the doctor  who believed he was in the last months of his life  wrong. All the while  he has continued to work to help others throughout this time. Recently  he has been referred to a clinic in the southwest (he resides on the east coast)  which boasts a 70% success rate  for people fighting cancer. The clinic is believed to be a good option because of the treatments they provide. He and his wife  Betty  will need to live there for a minimum of 2 months. Unfortunately  though they do have insurance  much of their expenses will not be covered. As a man who grew up on a dairy farm  he has never been afraid of working hard. He has been more concerned with helping others and would not ask for financial help with this burden. However  we have learned over the years  when we present a \""gift of thanks\""  he and Betty have both accepted it with extreme gratitude.So we  his family  including his six grandchildren (ranging from 1 year old to 19 years old) are asking for any contributions that can be made to the fund we have established. This money will be used to offset the cost of treatments and housing while they are staying out west. Please  DO NOT contact Roger or Betty regarding this matter. Those that know them well understand the importance of privacy and the need for personal space during these circumstances.   It is important for him to focus on the healing process.  In addition  we do not want to alert them of this fund until we actually present it to them. This has been a stressful time and I'm sure you can respect their wanting to keep to themselves and focus on the task at hand. Please send prayers  well wishes  and good vibes out to them.  Please feel free to reach out to any of us  their children  if you wish. Thanks for your love and support!Jen  Amy  Ryan and RachelP.S  There have been many requests for direct contributions  personal cards and get well wishes.  Please contact Jennifer by email at anotherstewart@gmail.com and she will be able to assist you with this information.""",31903,150000,32,21,164,178,6

A cousin who we have not seen in quite some time answered our prayers and is giving my mom her kidney! To give someone a piece of yourself literally  is the most selfless and generous thing someone can do! She is saving my mom's life and giving her a new life not connected to a machine!This donation will be put towards my mom's donor's bills as she will be out of work for a while after the surgery  transportation  and hotel costs.We just want to give back to this wonderful person and make sure she is well taken care of!

Funds for Hope Gardner,https://www.gofundme.com/bnsa5-funds-for-hope,1,BIRMINGHAM,AL,Hope began to have problems with her left arm earlier this year. Back and fourth with doctor visits  thinking she had bursitis and/or tendonitis  physical therapy did her no good and instead  the swelling kept worsening. Finally the doctors did a mammogram and in August  discovered that the source of her problems was instead breast cancer. More tests were ordered  and finally around Sept 15 after the biopsy  she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer  which has now already spread to her liver  bones  and lymph nodes. She has been struggling for months due to completely losing the use of her left arm to severe swelling  which makes day to day life very difficult and painful. With a little help  and a home healthcare team  she is getting by in the meantime.Since her body is too weak for chemotherapy  and obviously it's no longer possible to do surgery to remove the breast cancer it since it has spread  the doctors decided that the best course of treatment will be Herceptin  an IV treatment every 3 weeks through a port. It is hoped that this will slow the growth and has some potential to reduce the size of some problem areas  if it responds well. She is also on a hormone blocking pill  another response designed to target the problem areas and slow down the progress.Her son Drew is off on unpaid family medical leave at this time to help care for her  because as friends and family are all well aware  Hope also became a widow last December. Since income is limited now we decided to set up this cause to help offset the cost of her expensive treatments. Her first treamtent cost is $5 900 and that's just the first  so any support able to be offered will be greatly appreciated by the family.Please keep Hope in your thoughts  and in your prayers.  She appreciates them all.,1360,6000,6,23,21,336,6

Help Ansar with Duchenne MD Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/help-ansar-with-duchenne-md-fund,7,SANFORD,FL,Hi everyone  Ansar is my 11-year old cousin who was recently and unexpectedly diagnosed with DMD  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Just a year ago I saw him being able to walk without assistance  however today this incurable disease has left a bright  happy  young boy wheelchair bound and struggling to live a normal childhood.DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness that is caused by an absence of dystrophin  a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The skeletal muscles  which are used for movement  and cardiac muscle  are the primary muscles that are affected  which if  severely damaged leaves a person immobile. The only treatment is physical therapy and medicine to help slow down the progress and pain. With his strong will to live and hopes of having a normal life  Ansar performs exercises everyday and tries to walk pushing through the extreme pain without any assistance by his own choice.  Although he is trying he is still in need of professional help and thorough diagnosis through a program in Germany by a medical team that specializes in DMD. This program's cost starts at $20 000 without travel and living expenses. He is also in need of an electrical chair urgently as his current one is broken  which costs $1000. Ansar's mother is a single parent who had to leave work without pay to take care of her son and has little to no financial support from the government. She has support from her family but is still struggling to make ends meet.Ansar is the sweetest boy  who does well in school and is trying his best to live.

Steve Bennett Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/steve-bennett-needs-our-help,7,WARMINSTER,PA,"Steve is a person who  despite multiple disabilities  has an established work history of more than 30 years. As the result of a fall at home in Sept 2013  he did severe damage to his left rotator cuff  which left him unable to ambulate with crutches and forced him into a power wheelchair full time. Although surgery was performed  rehabilitation and recovery did not go as planned. This left him unable to properly care for himself and forced him into early retirement at the age of 53.In January 2014  friends  family and co-workers organized a benefit to help purchase a power wheelchair and a wheelchair accessible vehicle  so that Steve could attempt to maintain some level of independence. While  still in rehab after surgery  one of the organizers of the benefit took a good portion of the funds raised for their own personal use. Although some of the funds were eventually returned in very small increments of $5 and $10 at a time  what was returned took over a year. As a result  Steve had to abandon his original plans of returning to independence and had to give up the hope of self sufficiency. Despite securing a small loan to cover some of the cost for a wheelchair lift for his vehicle  he is still unable to purchase the proper chair/scooter needed to use that lift and travel about independently. Sadly  the individual responsible for the misuse of the funds in now deceased and the still missing funds can never be recovered.Due to his prior income from work history  he does not qualify qualify for programs and services designed to assist low-income individuals with disabilities. On paper  Steve has enough money to afford such equipment  but the formulas do not take into account living expenses such as rent  food  his other substantial medical costs that all strain what little fixed income Steve earns. Also  being only 57  he does not qualify for any benefits or services offered to senior citizens.Any funds raised will be used to purchase the needed medical equipment not covered by insurance  and to help offset the cost of ongoing medical expenses. None of Steve's goals are outrageous or frivolous. He simply wants to recoup the money from the original benefit that was stolen by a now deceased \friend\"" in order to maintain independence and a quality of life that Steve more than deserves.""",1745,8000,20,22,21,62,6

Husband battling brain tumor,https://www.gofundme.com/bill-zajic-battling-brain-tumor,6,LANSING,MI,My husband  Bill Zajic   found out he had two benign brain tumors in his parieto-occipital lobe in 2015. They were life-threatening tumors due to size and position.  The smaller tumor was deemed inoperable due to its relation to one of the central veins that provides blood supply to his brain. At the time  we were living in North Carolina  both working in education.   Bill is a Montessori trained teacher with 23 years in the classroom and 14 more as a Montessori school director. When he was diagnosed  he promptly decided to remove the larger tumor and undergo brain surgery. The surgery was a success and doctors were able to remove most  but not all of the tumor.  They left behind the smaller tumor. Four months after surgery  the skull bone that was replaced in his head during the first surgery became infected. Causing his immune system to become compromised.  Bill’s doctors surgically removed the infected bone and screws from his skull. During the third brain surgery  four months later  Bill had a specially designed plate placed in his skull to replace the bone. The second and third surgeries were successful and Bill once again recovered.Doctors told us there was a high likelihood  due to the nature of the cells in the tumor that it would eventually grow again. In December of 2016  it was discovered the tumors were growing again  much sooner than expected.  In 2017  tests reflected that the tumors had grown more  and were growing at an exponential rate  the cell activity was described as “aggressive”.  Doctors began to prescribe more medication in order to manage inflammation and provide a course of treatment. On the table were two options  surgery or radiation. At this time  we had moved to Michigan to be closer to our children.  Bill was now visiting the University of Michigan for treatment. The doctors there again offered the option of surgery or radiation. Bill elected to undergo the radiation treatments.  31 high-dose treatments were given.In early 2018  the effects of multiple surgeries  prolonged steroid medication  and radiation began to take its toll. Bill was beginning to suffer from multiple brain seizures and intense headaches that incapacitated him. Doctor and hospital visits were frequent. In the spring of 2018  Bill suffered a seizure that caused him to fall and break a vertebra in his back.  After nine days in the hospital Bill returned home.Bill spent 12 weeks in a back brace and had intense physical therapy.  Eventually he was able to walk again on his own. We have faced a nearly insurmountable financial hurdle. We are asking friends and family for help. As lifelong educators  we've always been able to afford what we need and raise our children  but extended hospital stays and expensive surgeries have drained our resources. Our goal is to pay off the debts we have incurred  plan for future expenses and try to live a normal life.,9318,25000,21,37,95,264,6

Help Katie heal,https://www.gofundme.com/du5gt-help-katie-heal,9,DENVER,CO,Katie Hnida has broken a lot of barriers  including becoming the first woman to play and score points in a Division I college football game. But now Katie is facing another challenge. She recently was prescribed a common  everyday antibiotic and suffered a rare  life threatening reaction---multi-organ failure. Katie’s kidneys failed  her liver shut down  and her bone marrow quit functioning. Her blood wouldn’t clot  and she had uncontrollable bleeding. Katie was admitted to the ICU in critical condition where she was given emergency dialysis and doctors debated the need for a possible liver transplant. Fortunately  she has stabilized and her doctors and family are optimistic that she will eventually recover from this crisis. But her road back will be slow and cautious. Here’s what is needed: First and foremost  your prayers and support. Second  any financial help would be much appreciated. Her hospital costs so far are more than $155 000 and continue to climb. Katie has health insurance but with a high deductible and large out of pocket costs  her policy falls substantially short of covering her healthcare needs. Other day-to-day expenses will also need to be met since it’s estimated that she will be unable to work for at least the next 4-6 months. Katie is on the front lines as an advocate  educator  and voice for survivors of domestic violence  sexual assault  and child abuse. The majority of her work is through nonprofits  and she dedicates a substantial amount of time providing pro-bono counselling to survivors of trauma. Katie has always given freely of herself  and now needs your help to recover. Whatever you can give is greatly appreciated  not only for Katie  but those she works with. Please consider sharing this message  and help Katie heal.,61830,71500,0,86,1,875,6

Monica&apos;s Brain Surgery relief fund,https://www.gofundme.com/monica039s-brain-surgery-relief-fund,6,WOODSTOCK,IL,My sister Monica Powell is one of the most amazing people I know! She has a kind and loving heart  and would do anything for anybody that needs it.  She has such a positive attitude towards life  and lights up the lives of anyone she crosses paths with.  She is a loving wife to Brian Powell  and an amazing mother to  3 beautiful children  2 little girls and an angel baby boy. Ella is 4  Brianna is 2  and their Brother Nicholas is in heaven. She is a busy stay at home mom  and a Pampered Chef Consultant.  She is truly amazing! and now she is in need of some help.  Here is why...On Tuesday October 2nd 2018  my sister Monica Powell underwent brain surgery.  The surgery lasted about 9 hours and she is now recovering at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago IL.      It all started on Friday September 28th when she woke up with her body covered from head to toe with hives.  She went to the urgent care where they determined she was having some kind of allergic reaction to something unknown  she was treated and given medication to resolve the issue. The next evening her condition worsened and was taken to the ER by ambulance.  While at the ER she started to complain of an uncomfortable and tingly feeling in her arm which they thought was very concerning.  So after a series of questions the ER staff put Monica on a stroke alert and ordered a CT scan of her brain.   The CT scan reveled a half dollar sized tumor on her brain stem(completely unrelated to the hives).   She then was immediately transferred to Rush in Chicago  and after consulting with the neurosurgeons  they determined that surgery was a necessity.  They discovered that the cells in the tumor although benign were very rapid growing  and needed to be removed as soon as possible before it became potentially fatal.  So on Tuesday morning October 2nd in great spirits and a positive attitude she went into her 9 hour surgery.   The surgery was a success  they were able to successfully remove the tumor.  She did as a result of the location of the tumor permanently lose the ability to hear out of her right ear  and has facial paralysis  and weakness on the right side of her body.  She will need months of extensive physical therapy and has a very long stay at the hospital. Her road to recovery is going to be challenging.  Her husband is working 2 jobs to try to keep the family afloat  while she cares for their 2 children.  With the weakness and paralysis that was caused by the surgery  lifting anything over 10lbs  and doing simple daily tasks are going to be a huge challenge for her. Monica was unfortunately in the midst of switching her Medical insurance  and went into this stressful and traumatic situation  without any Medical coverage to help pay for some of the cost of this very expensive surgery  and all of the aftercare that is going to be needed once she returns home.  Her family is going to have hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills  this is why I am reaching out for help for my sister and her family.  Please find it in your heart to donate to help my sister with her brain surgery relief fund  any amount would be welcomed and greatly appreciated.,14585,100000,14,15,197,1000,6

Crystal&apos;s Lung Cancer &amp; Brain Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/crystal039s-brain-surgery,9,MARYVILLE,TN,On October 2nd  2018  Crystal went to Parkwest Hospital with a migraine & arm numbness. They treated & tested for cardiovascular issues due to numbness in her arm. Within a few hours  they did CT & MRI scans and found a massive tumor on the left side of her brain & a large mass on her right lung. They airlifted her to Vanderbilt Neurological ICU unit for surgery to remove the growth on the brain. They were unable to operate immediately due to medication given for treating the cardiovascular system. On Monday  October 8  2018  she will be in operation for approximately 5-6 hours to remove the fist-sized tumor. In some testing  they discovered she might also have lung cancer. Crystal has three children  the youngest being 9  18  & 19. These children are all in school. One week before this happened to Crystal  her mother was sent home from the hospital with hospice. The entire family is devastated! The expense of all this has become overwhelming for the family with driving to Nashville  caring for the children and missing work on her husband trying to care for all this. All of this will be a very long recovery. Crystal has always been there for anyone that needed her help. She has always helped others  and she hopes to be able to do this again after her rehab. It is hard to explain how the cost of this was very high after a few days with the mother in hospice. The schooling for the children is the most important thing for her. For the next few weeks  they will have to pay for rides to and from schools and food  and for someone to care for the children. Crystal may come out of surgery with impaired speech  amnesia  paralysis  and reduced mobility. If you can help out with this beautiful woman and her family  we much appreciate it. We hope no one else has to suffer such an event. Along with financial help  we appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers. Crystal is a firm believer in living life with God. Thank You,7616,100000,7,8,59,743,6

Help Iva beat scoliosis,https://www.gofundme.com/w44n8-help-iva,6,OLNEY,MD,This is my beautiful niece Iva. She is my sister's only child. She is a talented  energetic 13 year old. She is our pride and joy.At 7 years old Iva was diagnosed with scoliosis. From that day on my sweet niece started her fight with scoliosis. For years she had a daily exercise routine along with swimming. Eventually she had to start wearing a special corset for at least 20 hours a day. She visited Schroth method camps  which teaches a non-surgical treatment for scoliosis though exercises customized for each patient. Unfortunately  these efforts were not successful in stopping the curving of the spine  which is at an extremely dangerous 82 degrees. This severe curve of the spine endangers Iva's heart  lungs   and stomach.Iva needs to have a life saving surgery in the next 6 months. Without the operation she will start getting severe back pain  lung infections and heart problems.Iva went for a consultation in Germany with one of the leading surgeons in scoliosis- Dr. Per  Trobisch. Dr. Trobisch believes after the surgery Iva can lead a  normal active lifeThe cost of the surgery is close to $30 000 which is 3 times more than the average annual Bulgarian salary of $9600. We have raised close to $12 000 through family and are asking for help to reach our goal. Iva's operation has to be done before Summer 2019  which gives us barely enough time to do everything possible to reach that goal. Donating or sharing the GoFundMe with your friends would mean so much to us. Please help Iva get her life back.Thank you!,10341,10000,12,103,64,404,6

Medical surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/6gu36-medical-surgery,6,BURNSIDE,KY,It is with great humility that I begin this GoFundMe page.  I have dealt with a spinal injury for 17 years  with God’s grace I have during that time been able to manage this injury and still be allowed to be a blessing to those in my life and in need  but recently my injury became worse.  I experienced a large rupture of one of my herniated discs which is pushing in on my spinal cord and has left me unable to even take care of myself.  Simply sitting  standing  or attempting to walk around a grocery store has become a painful  difficult  and depressing act.  I was blessed to receive Medicaid assistance but even though the surgeon stated that I required immediate emergency surgery I was denied that surgery by the insurance company because I am too acute to receive physical therapy first  information I received two days prior to my scheduled surgery.  Since then I have been left to my own devices and the only assistance that I’ve received has been muscle relaxants to assist with the debilitating muscle spasms that occur. I know that times are tight for everyone but I would be so grateful for any assistance that I would receive.  If you can’t donate  I understand  please include me in your prayers and if you are associated with a church please consider bringing my plight to your congregation to ask for prayers.  I’d be very grateful!  If you haven’t much but could help with only a small amount  that would go a long way to assist me in my cause and get my life back.  Please consider sharing with all of your friends  family members  churches  and social groups.  The more people this reaches the better chance that I have of receiving the surgery that I require and the ability to get my life back.  The way I see it is if this request reached 100 000 people who were all able to donate even $1.00 each  that $1.00 would be the blessing that lead to the ability to receive the surgery that I require  the ability to live without horrendous pain  and to be able do things as simple as cooking a meal or tidying my home without being laid up in bed for days on end for having attempted to do so.  But even if it reached 5000 people all willing to donate a dollar  then I could purchase private insurance that would allow me to seek out the care that I require.  Thank you all for anything that you can do to help me.  Your thoughts  prayers  and assistance are greatly appreciated.,255,5000,11,5,6,41,6
Khalob&apos;s Cancer Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/khalob039s-recovery-fund,1,SAINTGEORGE,UT,Earlier this year  my son  Khalob  was diagnosed with Stage IV Testicular Cancer that had metastasized and moved into his abdomen.Gratefully  we learned that after the initial surgery to remove the main tumor  with treatments for the remaining tumor  we could look forward to 100% recovery. Three and a half weeks after the surgery to remove the main tumor  he began his first of four scheduled rounds of Chemo treatments.  Unfortunately  before he was able to complete that first round  he had complications from his lowered immunity and ended up in the ER with severe dehydration  3 infections and his organs were starting to fail… among other issues. From August 26th to September 26th  he has experienced 3 ER visits  1 helicopter ride  1 ambulance ride  2 hospital stays… totaling 14 days  and 7 doctors working with him. (Current hospital bill is over $166 000  we are expecting that to rise and aren’t sure how much insurance will be covering.)His spirits have been much better since he has been able to leave the hospital and finally no longer has any tubes or wires to manage.  We continue to feel blessed and hopeful as we journey through this experience. Amazingly  even without being able to finish the first round of Chemo treatment  the tumor  while still very large  shrunk about 30% giving more room for his stomach  and other organs.At his mid-September Oncologist (Doctor) appointment  he wasn’t a good candidate to continue the chemo treatments until he has regained weight and strengthened his immune system.  (It had been a challenge to eat  as the tumor had grown so large it was pushing his organs out of the way. His stomach shrunk from the lack of room.  Now that it has more room it is more possible for him to gain the weight he needs to.) This campaign will be going to support Khalob in living and medical expenses (co-pays  food  gas  auto repairs  everyday expenses  bills and what insurance doesn’t cover.) Thank you for any support you can give  it is greatly appreciated.  If there are other ways you feel you could be a support please email with your thoughts.,5592,20000,10,28,70,539,6
Help Tammy Beat This!!!,https://www.gofundme.com/helptammyfightlargebcelllymphoma,0,JEROME,ID,Hello everyone! As you all know my mama was diagnosed with Lymphoma 3 years ago. A year ago in September she was diagnosed with stage 3 double hit large B cell lymphoma. We spent a week in boise every 3 weeks for her 5 days of 24hour chemo. She had 5 rounds of this. It took alot out of her. She wasnt able to finish the 5th chemo as they found out she was allergic to the rutucksin which is the immunotherapy they have to give before the chemo to fight this cancer. It was killing her. It also made her get colitis. She spent 14 days in the hospital the end of December thought part of January to treat the colitis. Cause sending her home she would have died. We found out in March of this year that she was in remission. We were so happy!! Well lately mama has been having alot of pain in her bones. So they wanted to do another PET scan and not wait till September! Well they found metabolic activity in her tail bone area. The doctor said it could be a broken bone or bone cancer. Which mama knows it's not a broken bone and you could tell the doctor knows ita not as well. He just can't say for sure till she has her bone marrow biopsy next week. They are trying to get her in at salt lake for a trial of some short since boise doesn't deal with bone cancer. They are also talking about a T-cell transplant. Thank you for all you have done and for all the thoughts and prayers. You all are awesome! Any little bit of money helps as mama is going to have to be going back and forth to boise and possibly be having to travel back and forth to salt lake. I will update you all as we get more answers!!! God knows we can't do this life without our mama!!!! ❤❤❤❤,1320,15000,4,9,15,374,6

My Amazing Mom Linda,https://www.gofundme.com/my-amazing-mom-linda,0,TYLER,MN,About a week ago my mom got a call from her doctor. He said he was coming out to the house to talk to her so she called me up thinking  well it must be bad if he's coming out here. I jumped in the shower and took off to her house 40 miles away because I knew she needed my support. I got there about 5 minutes before the doctor arrived. Her doctor told her that she had a cyst on her pancreas that her breast cancer was back even though she had a double mastectomy about 3 years ago and almost died and that she had developed  bone cancer. I am still in shock with the news. My mom is the coolest mom ever. She is the mom that all of my friends wanted and were jealous of. She is very loving  kind and has the biggest heart in the world. But also doesn't take s*** from anyone. She is the backbone of our family. SHe is the kind of person that I would be lucky if I'm even half that good of a person or half as good of a mother. We were never afraid to tell her anything growing up. We always knew we could count on her and she has more love to give than she has ever been shown in return other than my Dad. My mom is the kind of person who would give her last dollar to a stranger if they needed it. She is the type of person that makes little gift bags around Christmas time and carries them in her car to give to kids that look like they need to be cheered up.  Even though she didn't really have the extra money to do so. She worked two jobs while I was growing up so we would be able to fit in and have what other kids had. I didn't really understand how big of a deal that was until I had kids and had to get a job of my own.She is on a fixed income because she had to quit working when she got sick the last time and both her and my parents are retired. She has diabetes and has to pay for insulin and now they are going to have all these other added cost for travel expenses and bills due to treatment she will have to endure.            Finding all of this out  not once did she feel sorry for herself. She says she's not afraid to die  she's worried about leaving my dad behind. If anybody deserves a helping hand in this world it would be my parents.  EVeryone who has ever met them loves them and in this type of world there are not too many people that are truely so genuine and pure of heart.If you can't help with a monetary donation please leave comments and memories to make her smile!! Or share the shit out of this. Thank You! Family of Linda Welvaert Slettedahl,320,2500,6,13,9,123,6

He spent the next three weeks in the Neurological ICU being cared for by the most amazing team of healthcare professionals we have ever encountered.  During those three weeks  he also faced several other major medical issues in addition to having a significant brain injury.  With odds stacked against him  he never stopped fighting and has been able to overcome many of the other medical issues that he encountered. He is finally at a point where he is stable and his brain has the chance to start healing.  During these past few weeks  we have witnessed an outpouring of love and support for our Dad and our family that we can’t even begin to describe.  So many people have been asking if we need anything or what they can do to help.  Sometimes we find ourselves so overwhelmed by the situation itself that it has been hard to give everyone an answer.At this point  there are so many unknowns. What we do know for certain is that the recovery from an injury like this will be a long road. As he progresses  there may be things that Dad needs for his recovery and expenses incurred that are not covered under his health insurance. Our hope is that by establishing this account  it will help ease the financial burden for our Mom and ensure that Dad continues to get the best possible care he can. Anyone that knows our Dad knows him as a genuinely good man. They recognize his kind spirit  dedication to his family  sense of humor   work ethic and willingness to help anyone without hesitation. Our family cannot thank everyone enough for the support we’ve received so far. We truly believe that Dad would have not made it this far without the prayers  well wishes and positive vibes from so many. Please keep them coming!￼￼￼,7342,15000,15,49,80,386,6

Ed&apos;s Fight Against Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/ed039s-fight-against-colon-cancer,1,FREDERICK,MD,"Ed  my brother-in-law  is one of the most devoted dads I know  and there's simply nothing that he wouldn't do for his 7-year-old son Iggy. They do everything together - there are no reservations. As he always said  \Time is the most valuable thing I could ever give him. That's all that matters\"" However  the recent setback will surely change all that.  Ed was unfortunately diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer a month ago. The tumor has been removed  along with a third of his colon. Our hope is that chemotherapy will soon kick off once full recovery from the surgery is complete. However  he just underwent a second major surgery due to the complications from the first one  and this only added another setback to his already painful situation. We are all optimistic that he'll beat this terrible disease to the ground  despite the repercussions he's been dealing with. But the recurring medical expenses keep piling up as expected  and I'm afraid that this needs to be addressed soon. We cannot do this on our own. And so we ask for your help  as we are hoping to raise enough funds that will cover some of the medical bills  as well as the upcoming chemotherapy sessions that will take a whole full year. Our hope is to have Ed direct all his efforts to win the fight of his life - and let the rest of us focus on making that possible for him. Friends and family are doing the best they can for the cause. Any help will be very much appreciated. We thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts. Please check out our Facebook page for any updates regarding Ed's journey to recovery:  https://www.facebook.com/edsfightagainstcancer.

Steven&apos;s Wish,https://www.gofundme.com/steven039s-wish,6,GILLESPIE,IL,Steven Olson needs a new brace for his leg  and needs around 10 000 dollars. If anyone could help him out that would be so awesome because he's had a tough time lately getting around definitely at work and this would help so much for him thank you. The device is not covered by insurance.  He detailed more about his story below. I am a 21 year old part-time college student and I work part-time and live with my parents in Springfield  Illinois. I was born without a tibia in my right leg and my left foot was a club foot with abnormal leg muscle and bone structure in the foot and ankle. At the age of 11 months my right leg was amputated through the knee and doctors at Shriners hospital in St. Louis began casting my left foot. When I was 2 years old  I learned to walk with a prostheses and a brace  after physical therapy at the St. John’s hospital pediatric center in Springfield  Illinois . My orthopedic surgeon performed an osteotomy on my foot at St. John’s Hospital when I was 8 years old. I've never been able to walk long distances  and as I've gotten older I experience more pain in my foot and ankle. Like most boys  sports has been one of my favorite activities. Shooting hoops with my best friend next door and playing softball and basketball at a Christian youth camp for a week each summer are some of my happiest memories. Above all  my faith in God has kept me going! Despite moments of asking why I was born like this  I know God loves me and many people have been inspired by my life and my desire to be the best I can be. Recently I discovered a brace called the ExoSym that is only made at the Gig Harbor Hanger Clinic near Seattle  Washington.( http://www.hangerclinic.com/bracing-support/adult-le/Pages/Limb-Salvage-ExoSym.aspx) This brace was designed to help injured veterans to be able to walk again and some to return to active duty  but it has also helped injured firefighters  and those like me who were born with physical disabilities. I am trying to raise money to make the trip out to Seattle to get casted and then to get fitted and receive therapy to use the device. The brace is not covered under any insurance and costs around ten thousand dollars. My friend  Chase  started a Go Fund Me called Steven’s Wish. I would be forever grateful for any help to make this wish a reality!Sincerely Steven Olson,1070,10000,10,11,21,167,6

Help Dawn Mechling(Norris) Recover!,https://www.gofundme.com/n5e3kc-help-dawn-recover,0,SEVILLE,OH,Hi  My name is Ashley and I'm starting this campaign for the most important person in the world to me  my mom  Dawn. There aren't enough words to explain just how much she means to me or the people around her  but I'm going to try. In her  (almost  her birthday is the 19th of October)  forty-four short years on this planet  she has given more love than some people do their entire lives. She has become a mother to seven and a devoted wife. She gives everything she is without thinking twice about it and some days I think she cares more about other people than she does herself. She has become my very best friend  the only true constant in my life. She has kissed every flesh wound better. She has helped me nurse broken heart after broken heart back to health. She has fought for me time and time again. She's taught me to be brave  kind  and compassionate. She has taught me to love  forgive  and survive. She even gave me my sassy sense of humor. She blessed me with sarcasm. She has sculpted me into the human being I am today. She continues to help me grow. She has always been my rock. She's never given up on me  has always looked after me  and I don't know where I'd be without her. It's time that she be looked after  so I'm reaching out to you all for a little help. One day in 2013  (You'll have to forgive me  the exact dates are a little fuzzy.)  my mom used the restroom  was washing her hands  and all of a sudden she couldn't breathe. She was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and was admitted for a week. We were afraid because up until that point  she was seemingly healthy; She worked a full-time job  was living a full life. We had no idea what the problem was. She was diagnosed with a handful of heart and lung related problems  including COPD  emphysema  pulmonary hypertension  and congestive heart failure. She came home on medications and on oxygen. We had hoped the oxygen was temporary  but years later  she's still on it  and her condition has worsened. She now has 30% lung capacity. While she was sick  she was able to be at home  with regular doctor appointments. She eventually quit her job and focused on her health  and myself  my Dad  and two of my other siblings care for her. She was also told that at some point  she would need a lung transplant  but we figured that wouldn't be for quite some time. She struggled with the whole situation understandably  but she always put on a brave face. She went to her appointments and she still took care of us. She still is herself  even in the midst of everything going on. One appointment  her doctor had found a couple small pneumothoraces  or pockets of air in her lungs. He thought that given the right treatment  they would work themselves out and so she was sent home. My mom had always gone through periods where her breathing was worse than others  and when she was struggling a little more  we figured it would clear itself up. She went to the doctor to get checked out and he wanted her admitted. He saw that the pockets had indeed gotten bigger. The doctors debated for sometime on whether or not she would need a chest tube to release the air  and when her breathing got so bad that she couldn't inhale  they had no choice. She was rushed to another hospital and they did the procedure  and she could breathe again. She was so relieved  she cried. She was put on her regular oxygen and we thought all she needed was to heal. Within a couple hours  she begin to struggle again and she felt what she described as her stomach filling up with air. She wasn't taking in oxygen  she couldn't. They then put her on a BiPAP machine which did her breathing for her. It pushed oxygen into her and kept her stable. They later found out that the air in her stomach she was experiencing was not air at all  but carbon dioxide  which is what we exhale when we're breathing healthily. It wasn't coming out. Her carbon dioxide levels were some of the highest they'd ever seen and they didn't understand how she was conscious  but realized it was probably because her levels must usually be pretty high and she'd built up a tolerance to it. This is when they decided that she would need the lung transplant sooner rather than later. They transferred to yet another hospital  this time one of the best in the world  Cleveland Clinic  and she was put into ICU where they could monitor her closely. She was still using the BiPAP machine  but was growing so tired. It was putting so much strain on her body. They talked to her and us about putting her on a ventilator for a few days  to let her body rest  and to see what they could do about her carbon dioxide levels. They had to bring them down and regular her breathing. In comes the Hemolung machine. If you've never heard of it  it's because it's new. It's had success in other countries such as Japan  and in Europe  but it had only been used once in the United States  and never at the Cleveland Clinic. They wanted to try it on her. She got approved for it! They did the procedure and the machine worked its magic. It was taking her blood  running it through tubes  removing the carbon dioxide and putting it back into her body  and her levels were  coming down! It looked like a success! They waited until they felt she was ready and then took her off of the ventilator and then the Hemolung machine. Her breathing returned to her normal  she was able to put normal oxygen back on  and she was talking. She was walking. She could eat and do things for herself again  and so she was moved out of the ICU. We found out just today that her levels are rising again and they're doing what they can to bring them back down  but the fact remains that she does need the transplant. She was meant to check into a rehab facility tomorrow  but they're going to hold off on it until they're sure she is ready.  She's fighting and we're fighting with her. There is no giving up. We're taking baby steps at a time  but we are going forward  no matter how long the road is. We were told that we need to have some funds set aside for expenses  which is why I'm opening this up. This is completely new to me  but I figured I should try and see what happens. We need funding for her medical expenses  and new medicines once she does have her surgery. We needs funds for transportation  to keep us going  because it is A LOT of gas. Both my brother and I are working  but it's still difficult. This money would be for anything she or our family may need during this time. I would be forever grateful to each and everyone of you if you would donate to help take care of a woman who deserves to stay here with us much longer. We aren't ready to say good-bye yet and neither is she. So please  any amount helps. Your consideration means everyhing to myself  my family  and my mother. And please share this with your family and friends to spread the word! If you are unable to donate  one thing I'd like to ask you for are your well wishes  and if you are religious  your prayers. Those help too. The best way to reach me on through GoFundMe  my facebook at Ashley Lynn Norris  or through my e-mail: ashleylnorris@hotmail.com!  Thank you so much for taking the time to read! I hope we reach our goal!,925,2000,3,46,10,270,6

Helping Havoc,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-havoc,6,HOLLYWOOD,FL,Hey everyone For all of you that know Havoc you know he’s always a happy and energetic pup. A few days ago he started limping and became weak   by Friday he couldn’t walk at all. We took him to the vet and they recommended an MRI after they couldn’t figure out what was wrong. This morning (Sunday) we took him to a neurologist for an MRI and 3 hours after dropping him off they called us to come back in.  After what felt like forever the doctor finally came in and told us the worst news ever  our 1 and 1/2 year old pup has a tumor inside of his spinal cord. Neproblastoma is an extremely rare tumor found in pups from 1-2 years old. It develops at birth and sometimes goes completely unnoticed until it causes paralysis  like it did in Hav. Our best option is to have them remove it (hopefully removing it all) and then start the recovery process. As you can imagine  spinal surgery isn’t the cheapest surgery out there. After all is said and done his medical bills are totaling somewhere around 12 000$.Havoc is more than just our pup  he’s a part of our family. Anything will help even if it’s just prayers. Thank you guys and please share.  ❤️,820,11500,23,7,22,51,6

Need help paying for medical bills,https://www.gofundme.com/5xmy3-need-help-paying-for-medical-bills,7,SOMERSET,WI,This is difficult for me to do since I've been self sufficient for so many years  but I am in need of help paying for recent medical expenses.  Since 2014 I've been dealing with a variety of health issues  beginning with tingling sensations in my hands and arms that I never found an explanation for.  A year later I developed a shoulder impingement that required 6 weeks of physical therapy. The following year it was the other shoulder  again requiring 6 weeks of physical therapy. The last couple of years I have been dealing primarily with what I have finally been told is detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. I began having preliminary symptoms late in 2014. The root cause is neurological in nature but it has been causing other symptoms. I've been seen by 3 specialists so far  the first 2 costing me a lot of money already in tests and medications to try and treat the other symptoms  but never treating the root cause because they did not do the correct testing. The 3rd doctor finally ran the correct test to determine the problem and tell me that the previous treatments had been useless as they were not focusing on the actual problem. So far  I have already spent in excess of $14 000 from 2014 to 2017 in failed treatments for this issue  since I was being misdiagnosed.At the beginning of this year I was still receiving the failed treatments but I also began using a new insurance provider through my employer. This new provider deemed the treatments as experimental or informational and thus would not cover those treatments. The total cost of those treatments cost  just under $3000  none of which was credited to my deductible. Other medical expenses covered by insurance still cost me another $1500 that went towards the deductible. Unfortunately I was terminated from that employer in April when they decided to use sub-contractors for more of their work  leaving me and a few other people out of a job. I found a new job in May that provided insurance coverage with a $3000 deductible  but have since accrued $2500 in new expenses being tested by this new specialist. On October 10 I am going to have a procedure done that should give me at least decent relief from my symptoms while I try to find out what is responsible for causing this problem. This most likely means seeing a neurologist and going through some MRI's to hopefully find the cause  and then receiving treatment to resolve the problem. To further complicate my financial situation  I've spent $3000 in chiropractic services this year that I had hoped would give me some relief from this problem. So far the chiropractic services have been relatively successful in relieving chronic neck and back pain as well as providing limited relief from a previously diagnosed digestive problem. Unfortunately  it hasn't provided much relief in other areas. So far the only expense I've been able to pay has been the chiropractor as a monthly payment plan was set up after my 1st visit. I tried applying for financial assistance to help with the medical expenses from the beginning of the year but after waiting for 4 months  I finally received word in mid September that the application was denied.  And about a week later I received my bill for the test done in August that had finally revealed what exactly was going on. So  this is where I'm at right now. I realize the goal is higher than my current expenses but I'm not exactly expecting to make that goal. If I do make it  then any additional money will be set aside for medical expenses going into 2019.,475,10000,19,5,6,20,6
Gianna&#x2019;s fight : Ulcerative Colitis,https://www.gofundme.com/giannas-fight-ulcerative-colitis,9,TOMSRIVER,NJ,I am writing this on behalf of my cousin Gina and my niece Gianna. This is Gianna Lucile. She is a 10 year old girl who  in the past week  has been through pure hell. On September 30  she was rushed to the hospital with severe stomach pains & symptoms that were getting worse and worse by the hour. She was monitored and admitted due to the extreme presence of blood in her stool. She was then transferred to Monmouth Medical Center  because her symptoms escalated and the doctors began to believe it was her appendix. Her pain continued to progress further as hours passed. Her and her parents  Gina and Dan went days without any answers  and she was still in consistent paint. After the bacterial and viral tests came back negative  they were told she needed an Endoscopy and a Colonoscopy. On Wednesday  Gianna prepared for them  and on Thursday was the day for the procedures. By Thursday at about 11am  they had their answer. Gianna was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis also known as Irritable Bowel Disease(IBD). This is a life long disease that she will have to take 3 000mg of medication a day to manage. Dan  Gianna’s dad  is the main financial supporter in the family and recently had switched from his job of many years to a Union job. This switch forced an automatic cancellation of their current medical insurance plan  until his new job’s insurance kicks in (about 2 months) Both Dan and Gina have not been able to work this week since Gianna was admitted and are struggling with money. Gianna’s daily medication is going to cost $1 553 for the month. We are asking for help in this very stressful time of need  to be able to afford Gianna’s medication this month so she can start to get better.  Please donate and share. Our family appreciates everything greatly.,300,1600,7,19,7,87,6

Surgery Gone Wrong! Let&#x2019;s Help Out,https://www.gofundme.com/6870mtc,6,MECHANICSVILLE,MD,I’m asking from the bottom of my heart for any donations to help my cousin and her family in this time of need. Kristen Hayden Stine had Bariatric surgery on June 6 th 2018 and since then she has had 4 other surgeries to fix complications from first surgery. Kristen hasn’t worked since June 3rd 2018 due to the surgery and most of all due to the complications from the surgery. She is married to her husband Tony Stine who has had to make many sacrifices here recently such as getting rid of his new truck and putting them now down to only one vehicle instead of two. He also had to resign from his job so he can take care of Kristen with her being in and out the hospital so frequently and with her needing help with everyday daily needs  and of course helping take care of their two sons. They are now down to only one income coming in. but they have exhausted all their options at this point they have spent all of their savings on house hold bills. So I’m asking you all please if you can donate ANYTHING it would be much appreciated and would go to house hold bills  doctors bills that are steadily piling up and food and things needed for the boys and Kristen herself as she continues to slowly recover.,870,8000,8,11,8,89,6
Help Elwina with Medical Care and Save her Home,https://www.gofundme.com/help-pay-for-medical-care-and-save-a-home,9,PleasantGrove,UT,I met Elwina over 10 years ago at the local gym; I workout there a few days a week and this sweet lady works there as a janitor.  She's an older lady but works harder than anyone I've ever met  and that's how she caught my attention  and over time we struck up a friendship. Friendly chats with Elwina over the years have given me a glimpse into her life  and  she hasn't had an easy one.  These past few years have become incredibly difficult as she has found herself caring for her sick and fully disabled husband  all while trying to work full time to make ends meet.  With absolutely nobody to help her she has been working from 4:00 am until noon each day  and then spending all afternoon and evening caring for her husband.  It's been impossible for her  with her husband's health continuing to fail and her home being foreclosed upon.  When things reached a breaking point a year ago a number of good people began to step in to help improve her situation. Her home was saved from foreclosure earlier this year  and her husband was recently placed in a skilled nursing facility to receive the medical care he requires.  These were exciting steps in the right direction  but Elwina needs some more help.Between Elwina's paycheck and her husband's disability check they barely make enough money to meet their financial obligations  and that is with Elwina working full time.  Since she has missed so much work caring for her husband they are behind on the mortgage again  and need at least $5 000 by December 11th to bring the loan current.  In addition  Medicaid will require Elwina to share in the cost of her husband's care  an expense she certainly can't afford to pay. This sweet lady needs a Christmas miracle and it starts with some financial help.   The hope is to raise enough money to bring her mortgage current  and to help with the ongoing mortgage payment to relieve her financial worries and this will require at least $20 000In addition  we hope to raise additional money to help with the cost of her husband's medical care for at least the next two years  requiring another $24 000.  These are great first steps  and there is so much more we can do from here.  Elwina's home requires some serious repairs  improvements and maintenance as it's been neglected while she's been caring for her husband.  Lot's of service  including supplies and manpower can make a huge difference as well.Thank you for caring about this little lady  I think it's about time she gets a break and has lots of good people take care of her for a change.,4005,44000,28,9,33,53,5

My life turned upside down a few days ago  I have recently been diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis). I am a active guy  I work as a fabricator during the day and skateboard on my off time and raise my two boys. I came into the hospital thinking that I hurt myself from falling from a skate session and for a couple of weeks the right side of my body was numb  felt super tingly I wasn’t feeling anything. Anyways long story short I had a couple MRIS done of my brain and my back. They came back and told me that there was white matter in my brain that consists of symptoms of MS. They told me the numbness was a flare of the disease and now I have to see a specialist. Right now  I am still in the hospital completing a steroid treatment. I have two beautiful boys that I need to care for  a huge hospital bill coming my way and of course my household bills. Due to everything I missed a lot of work. If anyone can donate anything  it will be gratefully appreciated. My family is doing all they can to help me but I’m reaching out for more help.

Mike Elias Hospital &amp; Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/mike-elias-hospital-amp-recovery-fund,8,PORTLAND,OR,Hello friends-For those lucky enough to live in town & have attended the Ship John party last night you know that Portland Country Underground sounds sweet as ever  that Mike's attention to his craft is still meticulous & masterful  & that a great time was had by many.  What you probably don't know is that after everybody left  there was an attempted robbery &  when Mike refused to surrender his cash  a violent assault on his person that resulted in multiple surgeries and an overnight stay in the Legacy Emanuel ICU.  Mike of course is tough as old boots  but this is a trying time for him and his family.  We're not sure yet as to the extent of his medical costs but they are sure to be formidable...  Please consider throwing a few bucks into the hat as he has done for many others and would surely do for you  & share this page freely.  His immediate family is understandably shaken from this ordeal so we'd ask that  at first  you tread lightly until everyone has a chance to get their bearings.  There will be much that can be done to help in the coming weeks (plus surely a benefit show or three)  so please keep Mike  Amanda  & Weston in your hearts going forward.  True to form & in spite of everything I might add that the thieves were unsuccessful in taking Mike's money.  Love to all.,54942,50000,31,110,835,1000,6

Monica Zigrang Medical Expense Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/monica-zigrang-medical-expense-fund,1,SAINTLOUIS,MO,In August 2018  at the age of 23  Monica found a noticeable lump in her breast.  The ultrasound looked questionable and due to family history of cancer and the BRCA1 mutation  her doctor encouraged her to have the BRCA1 genetic test. The BRCA1 came back positive and she began putting together a preventative care plan.  If you’d like to know more about the BRCA1 gene:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1Meanwhile  Monica’s doctor ordered a biopsy of the lump in her breast following the BRCA1 results a week later. On Friday  September 28th  the day before Monica’s 24th birthday  her doctor confirmed the lump was malignant and growing at a 95% rate.  Monica was then formally diagnosed with Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma aka Stage 2 Breast Cancer. Hours later  Monica also learned the cancer had already spread to a lymph node.Monica has already had her port placement surgery and her aggressive Chemo treatment plan will begin October 17th with surgery and radiation to follow.   Monica is a Junior Nursing Student at Maryville University and works at St. Luke’s Hospital as a Patient Care Technician. Because of her aggressive treatment plan  Monica was encouraged to take a leave from school and work.  Once recovered  she will continue with her nursing program so she can one day help those in need of medical care also!Due to her leave from work and her multiple upcoming treatments  her friends have put together this campaign to help alleviate the stress of financial burden from large deductibles  copays and non covered tests and procedures as well as daily living expenses while she takes the time to KICK CANCER!  If you know her at all  you know what an incredible young woman she is and how big her heart is.

Medical Fund for Sammie,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-fund-for-sammie,0,NEWJOHNSONVILLE,TN,Hello this is my daughter Sammie.  For those of you who don't know her story  I will start by saying  she is a 19-year-old full time student in college. She is studying to be a trauma Nurse. Sammie is a hard worker and works a part time job in between classes. Sammie was living life like any other 19-year-old young woman  loving life and trying to fit into what society says is the norm. 2 months ago  she started suffering from an excruciating headache that would not go away. Being a student and only having a part time job with no insurance she scraped together enough money to get a CT scan that her doctors ordered  which yielded no clear results leading to her head pain. Long story short  with no insurance and very little funds  she had to figure it out on her own and discovered she had a severe dairy allergy and could no longer eat any dairy. Within 3 days of being dairy free the headache finally went away  yay she was finally feeling great  the best she has felt in a long time  until…..2 weeks ago  when she accidentally ate a protein Bar that contained a trace amount of milk. Within 10 minutes after eating it she vomited  and 30 minutes later the headache came back. She thought no big deal  she would just be extra cautious in the future. The next morning the headache was gone  but so was 2 large patches of her hair. Within the next 3 days 75% of her hair fell out. As a mom it is devastating watching your beautiful daughter go through the pain of loosing her hair and not knowing why or how to help her. We watched handfuls just literally fall out of her head as she was walked across the room. Sammie  with a worried smile still managed to keep her spirits up and hold it together. The next few days she lost the entire front half of her hair. That morning she made the most difficult decision  possible of her life  and she buzzed the remainder of her hair off. This was a painful decision for her  but it gave her the power to control the last portion from falling out. She continued to hold it together as she watched her eyebrows and her lashes also falling out.One week after the start of her hair loss  we finally were able to get her into the doctor. The doctor said he did not even know how to treat it. Her immune system is attacking her hair. He referred her to a dermatologist.Finally  we had her appointment after another week of waiting and more bald shiny bald spots. We finally would have some answers  we can finally get some treatment to stop her immune system from attacking. The first thing we were told is the tremendous amount of money it will cost just to start running some test. We could barely afford the appointment  and immediately she needs 400.00 in blood work  and 700.00 for a biopsy just to start. It is devastating to walk out of an appointment with no answers  because you do not have the money to even do testing for a diagnosis.For those that know sammie  know that she has the sweetest nature. She is the kind of person that never ask for anything and never has not even as a child  she has always thought of other people and put them before herself. She has done numerous fundraisers for cancer  homelessness  child abuse  you name it she has helped and raised money for it. She has a huge heart of gold  but now she needs help paying for her own medical expenses to get this immune system under control. Imagine being a 19-year-old girl and dealing with the unknown and not being able to afford testing to diagnose  medicine to treat something attacking your body or a decent prosthesis wig. Sammie  always thinking of others would normally ever put herself first and ask for help  so we are doing it for her. She needs your help. It is urgent that she gets the medical test done.,590,5000,6,12,14,189,6

Help us Rescue our First Responder,https://www.gofundme.com/ThatOthersMayLive408Works,6,BOISE,ID,"Our First Responder is facing his biggest call ever … his own!Former Captain with the Layton City Fire Department  Alan “Cap” Matheson  is being poisoned by the very metal structure in his back that was meant to save him  and it’s got to be removed. The next surgery is scheduled for October 17th and will be major. The goal will be to remove ALL of the metal from Alan’s body  so the cobalt poisoning can be stopped  and the fractures can be repaired. As Cap prepares for recovery  we want to make his journey as easy as possible and would like to help offset any expenses. Please give generously and share this with your local community.Cap’s prognosis is good! His body is already responding to the first surgery just a few weeks ago. This next surgery will determine what needs to be done in the next two surgeries that follow.  This is great news  but it still means Alan will go through 4 surgeries in a year's time  all in a location over 300 miles from home  plus an unknown amount of rehabilitation  therapies  and prescriptions. The financial burden alone is tremendous. Looming in the background are the years of extensive monthly and procedure-related medical expenses that have stripped this family of being financially whole. If what others have experienced proves true for Cap  the cobalt leaving his body will return his mind and many of the ailments he is experiencing will resolve. Cap's life can be summed up by the way he lives it  \That others may live.\"" Alan has lived a life of service since his earliest memories. He has been a servant leader in the community  a teacher and mentor  a volunteer for numerous causes and efforts  fund-raised for other firefighters and first responders in need  and even while his health has been in a state of decline he has managed to still be there for friends and family at their times of need. Now  Cap finds himself needing a hand to reach in and pull him out of his darkness. Please help Cap focus on recovery and let's make sure everyone that went in  gets to go home  and gets to continue living their lives  “That others may live.” The Back Story...In the last year  doctors have repeatedly told Cap he could not be helped  and he was  “at the end of what medicine could do to help.\"" His wife  AnaLise  accepted the challenge  and said  \""Hold my Chocolate Martini!\"" Unable to give up or leave Cap physically and mentally damaged and without hope  she took Cap to 8 different medical professionals and the 9th one was a charm.  Everything took a turn for the better on Sep 22  2018  when a surgeon in Salt Lake City said the impossible  \""I can help! We can get you better and give you back your life!\""  The first surgery was performed on October 2nd with incredible results.  Already  Cap has regained feeling in his hands  arms  and toes!  He is now walking with better balance and now knows when he is holding his sweetheart’s hand.  Cap is now facing 3 more surgeries needed to save his mind and his life and to restore a quality of life he lost due to illness  injury and medical recklessness. In the last decade  Cap has endured more than $350 000 in medical procedures.  Just since 2010  Cap has undergone 4 surgeries  been in a coma  had 80% of his body was covered in 3rd-degree burns  endured numerous procedures and physical therapy. Nothing relieved the pain or stopped the degeneration of his health UNTIL NOW!   All of this to a father of three boys  a loving husband and a dedicated friend who loves Utah outdoors and used to enjoy 4 wheeling  hunting  shooting  vertical caving  rappelling and more.  His life’s work has been to pull people out of the terrifying darkness of emergencies and illness and to grab every hand that reached for help. It has been said that Cap would give you his last dollar because if you were asking you must need it more.  Cap has opened his heart and his home to many over the years.  I’ve heard this humble man say the very worst part of the pain and degradation his body is suffering is that he can no longer help others the way he once could. Thank you for your support and please share this story and ask others to help. With each of us sharing  we can accomplish this quickly and allow Cap to focus on recovery.""",1995,17500,9,11,12,109,6

Jesse James,https://www.gofundme.com/vp9wq-jesse-james,5,FORTCOLLINS,CO,Where do I even begin with this  Saturday October 6th Jesse and his friend Danielle were heading to a ride for life event  which they had just purchased tickets for. The event was supposed to be a time for friends and fellow riders to gather  and raise both money and awareness for a fellow rider who was severely injured in an accident earlier this year.  Despite the cold  gloomy fall day  both Jesse and Danielle were willing to bundle up and show their support. Not long after they left the house headed for the event  Jesse was confronted by an older driver in an SUV who committed a bikers worst fear and turned left in front of him. Jesse had just left a light near Harmony and College headed South  when the woman made the fatal mistake. Jesse and Danielle were both thrown from the bike as it took a direct hit into the side of the older woman’s car.  Jesse explained upon impact  he felt they were in the air forever  one can only imagine the incedent for all involved. In all of our worst fears  god decided he needed Danielle that day  and took her from the world.  Devestating is a word that doesn’t do this situation justice. Both the older woman  Jesse and Danielle were taken to the hospital. Thankfully the driver only sustained minor injuries  Jesse was not so lucky. It would be several hours before Jesse was able to come to  and realize what had happened and was informed that his dear friend Danielle was gone.  Despite the broken pelvis  torn ligaments in his arm  and too many surface injuries to mention all Jesse could focus on was Danielle. It was a long first night  Jesse didn’t sleep and when he did close his eyes  he was haunted by the moments of the morning. Both myself  my family and especially Jesse are not good at asking for help. But as I explained to him  at some point in life we all need some help. It’s more than ironic they were headed to support and raise money for a friend who was severely injured in a motorcycle accident early in the year. It’s now his time  Jesse needs help. He needs a lot of help  he had his pelvis screwed and plated back together this morning. The surgeon explained the break was so severe he had never used screws as long as the ones he had to use on Jesse today.  It will be some time before Jesse can walk  let alone work. As his family  we will all do everything we can but at this point we need some help from our wonderful community  but most of all god. Please do anything you can can to help Jesse  be it  a monetary donation  a prayer  a funny joke for him or a hug. At the very least  make yourself and others around you more aware of the people on the road and let’s all be a little more cautious and kind to one another. Here is to hoping and praying for the three families directly involved and countless others as friends of the families. Thank you for taking the time to read. As always  thank you all for your support  thoughts  prayers and wishes. Love  Jesse’s adoring family.,8665,10000,7,87,88,1000,6

One more surgery is required once Tracy has gotten over the fatigue from surgeries and radiation  and from the radiation \burns\"". Rick & Tracy live in a rural area in Saskatchewan  and had an approximate 3-hr drive to Regina for appointments with specialists and surgeons  resulting tests  scans  and surgeries. A P.E.T san was also done in Saskatoon  a further distance away. There have been many  many trips to and from Regina creating large gas expenses  with some trips requiring hotel stays as well. There will still be more trips made during the coming months. Radiation treatments were in Regina incurring further expenses for Tracy's accommodation at the Cancer Care Lodge for 5 weeks. There were also expenses for prescriptions  ostomy supplies after release from hospital  plus various cremes for the radiation \""burns\""  and painkillers. In addition to medical-related expenses  there was also a substantial loss of wages for Rick since he missed many days of work driving Tracy to and from Regina  and staying in Regina during surgeries. All of the above expenses have created huge financial burden and stress for Rick & Tracy.They still have a lot to deal with in getting Tracy to her \""old self\""; with hopes and prayers that there will be no future incidents. Our family can't express how grateful we'd be for your support in donating to this cause. Our goal is to raise $15 000PLEASE pass on this message of a plea for donations to family  friends and others you know. Sharing the Go Fund Me with your social network would mean so much! Heartfelt thanks in advance to all of you for your compassion and anticipated donations.""",3425,15000,31,23,29,38,6
Support Bill White,https://www.gofundme.com/support-bill-white,6,BUFFALO,NY,Bill White was recently diagnosed with esophageal cancer and began going through chemotherapy and radiation. After going through all that he had to have surgery to remove the remaining tumor. Surgery was supposed to be simple and non-invasive but unfortunately things did not go fully as planned.

Lexi loves life!,https://www.gofundme.com/lexi-loves-life,9,METAIRIE,LA,Lexi is a beautiful four year old that was born with an undetected heart condition called Aortic stenosis. At just seven weeks old  she showed a few signs that something wasn't right. After seeing a series of doctors  she was referred to a cardiologist who sent her directly to Children's Hospital in New Orleans. She had undergone a cath procedure to try and open her heart valve. The procedure took a turn and Lexi was placed on ECMO - a medical machine that runs your bodies organs. Once her body was stabilized  they attempted the procedure once more and were successful. Four months later  Lexi had surgery to repair an area of her heart. Doctors predict she will have to have her heart valve replaced as a young child  young adult and older adult. Recently  Lexi has also been diagnosed with epilepsy. She will undergo follow-up tests to determine her seizure frequency and make any medication adjustments. Lexi follows up with each of her specialists every 6 months. With the overwhelming past and accruing medical bills  the family would be so appreciative of prayers and any contributions to help relieve some of the financial burden. Through it all  Lexi always has a smile on her face and makes the best of every day.,470,25000,11,2,12,86,6

Surgery for Carlos,https://www.gofundme.com/emhmr-surgery-for-carlos,6,VALLEYVILLAGE,CA,My husband  Carlos  needs surgery. A couple of weeks ago  what was supposed to be a “simple outpatient procedure” went terribly wrong. Carlos landed in the ER and spent two nights in the hospital. Now  he is facing a complicated  invasive surgery on October 16  and we are at the end of our rope  financially. The last  three years have been economically devastating for us  punctuated by my own medical challenges  surgeries and recoveries. This surgery could not come at a worst time. Although we have insurance  we need help with the deductible  out- of-pocket costs and living expenses while Carlos is unable to work.  If all goes well  he will likely be out of work for at least 6 weeks following surgery.  In a perfect world  I would be employed and we would have some savings.  I haven’t worked in more than two years.  Although I’ve applied to more than 200 jobs  during this year alone  I haven't landed anywhere and all of our reserves are gone.    We appreciate whatever assistance you can give with the cost of the surgery -- or in helping me find employment. With gratitude and love Sandy,6425,5000,24,129,38,87,6

Rise for Risa,https://www.gofundme.com/rise-for-risa,9,WILMINGTON,NC,As many of you know  Risa Johnson was diagnosed on September 6  2018 with advanced Colon Cancer.   Risa is the prime supporter of her family of five  currently working 3 jobs to make ends meet. She is originally from Ohio and now resides in Wilmington  North Carolina.  Risa has devoted her life to working with older adults in the healthcare field in settings such as Skilled Nursing  Physical Rehabilitation  Acute Care and Home Care.  She also unselfishly volunteers her time at a food bank that assists with providing meals for those in need in New Hanover County. Since learning of her diagnosis  Risa and her family have not only had to handle the aftermath of Hurricane Florence  but numerous Doctor appointments and tests (PET scan  CAT scan  Ultrasounds  etc.).   It has already started taking a toll on her physically through increased fatigue and decreased strength and appetite.  Also   she has recently had to significantly reduce her work hours and will eventually have no source of income in the coming weeks.  Her team of Doctors concur that her next step in her plan of care will include 6 weeks of Chemo and Radiation(5 times a week) and weekly blood work/tests and visits with specialists.  Following the 6 weeks of Chemo and Radiation  Risa will be scheduled to have her 1st surgery to remove the mass and attach the ileostomy or colostomy.   After healing  Risa will be required to go back in for a second surgery. As a friend of Risa's  I am reaching out to ask for financial support for her during this journey.  She is one of the hardest workers and strongest women I know and she is not one to reach out for help.  All donations will be used to cover medical bills and basic living expenses for Risa and her family while she is unable to work.  Please consider a donation to my dear friend during this very difficult time for her and her family.,1290,30000,12,4,19,116,6

Give Ahmed Adam a new life,https://www.gofundme.com/give-ahmed-adam-a-new-life,9,PHILADELPHIA,PA,My name is Israa Adam and I am a Sudanese immigrant living in Philadelphia  PA. My brother Ahmed Adam (18 years old at the time) was in a terrible car accident in Sudan in 2011. He was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with internal bleeding that required an immediate surgery. Unfortunately after the surgery his condition continued to deteriorate. Ten days later we were told that he was suffering from septicemia  a serious blood poisoning. He was given strong antibiotics  but complications from his blood poisoning continued. Ahmed suffered more internal bleeding  organ failures  and skin tissue damage all over his body. He started losing his eye sight and became completely blind only a few weeks later. Those were painful days for Ahmed and for us as a family watching our teenage brother and son hanging between life and death  going blind  and suffering from widespread skin damage that left lasting marks all over his body.Over the past 7 years we have been seeking treatment for Ahmed and were told repeatedly that he can not be treated in Sudan. I am the only provider for my family and we don't have the financial ability to send him abroad for treatment. He has stopped going to school  started showing signs of depression  and even attempted suicide twice.We have contacted a couple of hospitals in India and learned that they can treat Ahmed so that he can recover his vision  treat his skin damage  and provide psychological treatment. The money collected will be used to pay for hospital and travel expenses.We truly appreciate your help and support and giving Ahmed another chance at life.,929,20000,13,5,24,137,6
Cason&#x2019;s Journey Through Autism,https://www.gofundme.com/casons-journey-to-recovery,7,HERMITAGE,TN,My nephew  Cason  was diagnosed with autism by Vanderbilt Children’s in May 2015 at the age of two years and seven months. Since his diagnosis  Cason has been enrolled in speech  occupational therapy  and applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy spanning the past three and a half years. While these treatment modalities have offered improvements  we have seen the most notable transformation in Cason since he received his first round of stem cell infusions from the Stem Cell Institute of Panama in June 2018. Cason is now more engaged with his siblings/peers and has a genuine interest in the world around him. Though Cason has made significant strides in his language skills  he is still not conversational  however  we are hopeful that further stem cell treatments will accomplish this. Unfortunately  this treatment option is not currently available in the United States  though trials are being conducted at major universities  such as Duke. Since this treatment is not approved  it is also not covered by insurance carriers  leaving families solely responsible for the financial burden. For the past three years  my sister and Cason have commuted to Nashville from Lafayette four to five days a week (140 miles round trip) in order for Cason to attend vital therapy sessions. Despite the amazing generosity of our family and friends  a diagnosis of autism is financially draining beyond most individual’s understanding  leaving it nearly impossible to fathom being able to afford an additional stem cell treatment. This journey with autism would be financially straining enough  however  my sister and Dustin also have two other amazing boys to care for  as well. If we meet our fundraising goal listed above  this will allow Cason to travel to Panama to receive an additional week of stem cell infusions. We have struggled with how to proceed with this obstacle  because we do not wish for people to feel as if we are begging for money. However  we also can not let this opportunity for an increased quality of life pass by Cason. This sweet soul deserves the chance to live a full  independent life  and we truly believe that these stem cell treatments will offer him that opportunity. Any donation  no matter the size  is greatly appreciated. Regardless of donation  please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.,35186,18000,16,195,127,621,6
Jayden&apos;s service dog,https://www.gofundme.com/jayden039s-service-dog,7,ESCONDIDO,CA,Jayden was diagnosed with Autism when he was two years and ten months. Then shortly afterwards he received his Epilepsy diagnosis. Treating his conditions have been a roller coaster to say the least. He is an open medical study. It has also been determined that Jayden has a refractory response to traditional medication  this causes him to be on large doses of medications to treat his medical conditions.  Jayden has zero safety awareness and has had close calls where he has actually escaped our home. He has been unsuccessful at school as he leaves the learning area about 50 times a day  he has a love for climbing furniture and leaving an unwanted situation to find his daddy (we all know the attachment between the two of them). About two years ago his doctor suggested looking into getting Jayden a service dog that would be trained to help manage the symptoms associated with his Autism. We were on many waiting lists  then in June our family dog tragically died unexpectedly. Jayden who is considered nonverbal and speaks only very limitedly began asking for the dog by name so Jeremy and I called every organization possible and despite the HUGE cost made the decision that getting Jayden a service dog right away would be best.Service dogs can be a large expense  regardless of where the dogs come from. Organization-trained service dogs can cost up to $25 000. That includes two years of training  plus the organization’s expenses for food and veterinary care.So many people from different organizations helped us to find a dog considered qualified to enter the training program (usually you are paired with a dog that is already trained). Our situation has us doing it backwards from the traditional method most people use.  We have the dog and she will be trained to her highest ability level. She came from a breeder who has been successful breeding service dogs for 7 years. Instantly Koko and Jayden formed a connection and we have been truly blessed with how incredibly she has done with her training. She is being training by one of the best dog trainers in California and he is confident that with continued training she will able to work with Jayden. She is about to enter phase 2 of her training. She will also be meeting with a state evaluator soon to take her certification to become a certified therapy dog. After phase 2 she will begin working on her service dog certification. She will be training to be tethered to Jayden and act as his anchor in situations he tries to climb and or escape to help with his lack of safety awareness and to help with some of his other behaviors. This has been a huge expense for our family  we never considered asking for help like this before but we are really feeling the financial strain this has put us in because we have already paid for the dog  all her health care and Phase 1 of the training. Any help would be amazing and would be tremendously appreciated.,3850,20000,17,19,5,20,6

Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Twiggs Fan Club,https://www.gofundme.com/margaret-quotpeggyquot-twiggs-fan-club,7,GARLAND,TX,"For those of you that don’t know our dear Peggy Twiggs but know “of “ her  and for those that do know her and know that her health has taken a turn in the last several years  I wanted to fill you in on what has been happening. Margaret \Peggy\"" to Drum Corps friends  has Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)  http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/psp/psp.htm PSP is a rare brain disorder that affects her speech  vision and balance making walking and speaking extremely difficult. It is similar in some aspects to Parkinson’s PSP  but more progressive. Peggy is a “trouper” when it comes to acceptance of her diagnosis and she continually remains positive and upbeat. She finds ways to slow the progression by riding a reclining stationary bike some 3 hours a day! She hasn’t missed a beat  as Independence is vital to her maintaining her dignity. As many of you know Peggy was a Color Guard Instructor for several years teaching young adults and teens ‘Peggy Spins” which she invented! Even if you don’t know her  your instructors probably taught you these  if you marched in any Color Guard in the US and Internationally! She taught many  many groups such as The Cadets  27th Lancers  St. Anthony’s Revere  Quasar  Emerald Marquis  Blessed Sac  and St. Joseph’s Medford just to name a few. In 2005 Peggy was inducted into the prestigious “Drum Corp Hall of Fame.” One of the only 6 women to achieve this honor for her ground breaking work. Peggy says  “For every year I taught  there was always that very special moment  or that special kid who would finally 'get it'. Wins or losses  I don’t remember  but I would always say to the groups I taught  'Remember the audience reaction  because years later  you may not remember what place you finished but you will always have the applause in your heart.' How lucky are we! I have those memories with me inside.” Coping and living with this uncommon disease has many challenges  physically  spiritually  mentally and financially for her and her family. There are numerous expenses ongoing and coming down the road  with this diagnosis. I have asked myself (as many of you have asked me ) “what can I do?” So that is why we are starting this page  to help her receive the best Palliative care at home along with purchasing equipment  if needed  and adaptations to her home etc. As far as I'm concerned she deserves the best! She loves hearing from former students and friends and if you would like to send “snail mail” to her just email me or Facebook message me and I will send you their address. You can always send her a Facebook message (and post pictures) as well!""",2737,20000,26,14,38,72,6
Mira&apos;s Medical Marathon,https://www.gofundme.com/mira039s-medical-marathon,7,GARRISON,NY,It has been a long and harrowing month as Nell and Ted watched their bright and enthusiastic little girl dramatically disappear before their eyes. From seizures to catatonia  MRI's and spinal punctures  plasmapheresis and IVIG infusions  and finally chemotherapy drugs  Mira has been through it all. Mira has been diagnosed with an extremely rare condition called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis  a form of autoimmune encephalitis. After enduring multiple ineffective treatments she is the middle of a series of chemotherapy treatments that will hopefully bring her towards recovery. There are still more tests to be done and a significant rehabilitation period to navigate.  As the treatment continues into its second month  Mira's care has necessitated that both Nell and Ted be at the hospital all day and night.  They have been unable to work  and Nell had to take an unpaid leave of absence from her new nursing job.  They are in great need of financial support to pay for child care for Graham  Emmett  Jasper  and Henry.  Due to Nell's unpaid leave of absence they have also had to go on COBRA to continue insurance coverage and will use the funds to pay for the significant out of pocket medical costs which are expected to continue for many months.We are asking for help on behalf of the Timmer family  as they have been there countless times for their friends and community in our times of need. Nell and Ted are grateful to their perceptive doctors for picking up on this rare disease  to Mira for being the strong and fierce creature that she is  and to their four resilient boys who have had to make major adjustments in being away from their Mom and Dad while worrying about their sister.

This seizure usually occurs for no obvious reason and is uncontrollable.Layla is blessed with two wonderful  loving and supportive parents.  Lyndsay and Chris are very optimistic and positive parents who continue to remain strong through this journey of uncertainty.  They see the glass as half full  never half empty.  Even though this has been a stressful and daunting journey  they embrace it head on with the steadfast attitude of hope and faith.  No parent is ever prepared to hear that their child suffers from any medical issues  especially to hear that your child has a brain tumor.  This diagnosis has made Layla and her parents determined  ready and eager to give Layla the childhood that she deserves.Lyndsay and Chris immediately went to numerous doctors  did their research  spoke with other parents who share this exact experience with Hypothalamic Hamartoma tumors.  After an arduous venture of research  and the advice of experts on this exact tumor  Layla will undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Layla and her parents will soon travel from Pennsylvania to the Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston Texas for Layla’s surgery. So far  this journey has warranted extensive time off from work for Chris and Lyndsay.  Lyndsay  a dental hygienist  has taken a leave of absence without pay to care for Layla. Chris  who owns his own HVAC & plumbing business has also had to put a lot of jobs on hold during this trying time.  As with any illness  it can not only be devastating to have to come to grips with a child with a serious medical illness  but the financial aspects are also challenging.  Insurance alone does not cover all of the expenses of Layla’s surgery as well as all of her doctor visits.  Lyndsay and Chris not only have out-of-pocket medical expenses  but lost salary  and travel expenses as well.  Please help Layla’s parents with their much needed medical  travel and living expenses.  One never knows in life what each day holds.  No one ever plans on having catastrophic expenses due to the unexpected health issues of a loved one.  A parent will go to the ends of the earth for their child.  Any and all donations would be appreciated to help Layla’s parents offset their mounting medical and living expenses.Thank you to everyone for your love and support of Layla. Please keep Layla and her family in your prayers. https://bit.ly/Layla’s hope for HH journey""",6925,10000,16,69,83,347,6

Service Dog Training,https://www.gofundme.com/u34bfe-service-dog-training,7,WAUKEE,IA,Hello everyone! My name is Mackenzie and my pup's name is Indy. I got Indy at 8 weeks old in hopes of being able to train him as a service dog for myself for anxiety responses and a few other mental health concerns. His temperament has proven that he will be amazing at his tasks and service!Getting a service dog that is already trained for tasks is a long and expensive process. That's why I decided to train my own. This though is still a very expensive path as the normal dog payments come in (vet/immunizations  food  toys etc) but also gear for him (service dog in training vests  special leashes  forms and paperwork etc.) I can teach him the basic obedience skills  but I don't know how to task train. This is where I need your guys' help! Dog classes are expensive and I need some help to get him and I there. By going to these classes I can speed up the process for Indy and I to continue our bonding and helping me with my anxiety. Task training doesn't usually start in dogs until around the age of one  so that'll be this coming may. Current obedience classes can start now. I have already taught him sit  lay down  stay and recall with little distractions which is amazing for a 3 month old puppy!  I've worked countless hours prepping him to be the best obedient pup possible and it's been such a joy to work with him! Going to classes will further his and my own knowledge for training.Without being task trained he's already helped me so much  I can't wait to see what else he will be learning! I will be incredibly thankful to any donations to help get us down this path! <3 If you want to watch our progress Indy has an Instagram where we share cute pictures and videos  and demonstrate his training skills! You can follow him @Indy_miniaussie and see how your donation has helped our progress! Thanks again! Peace  love and bless!,1470,2500,14,59,21,111,6

Austin&apos;s Crohn&apos;s campaign,https://www.gofundme.com/austin039s-crohn039s-campaign,6,PembrokePines,FL,At 12 years old  Austin was diagnosed with Crohn's  disease and weighed a mere 65 pounds.Now  at 21 he is extremely underweight again. Last year he was rushed into emergency surgery after a tomato sized abscess burst into his abdominal cavity. Before it was over he had lost 4 inches of his bowel.Imagine going through every day with waves of nausea and pain. It's hard to watch.His plans for college were unfulfilled when he went in for surgery. He decided to put that dream away when he realized he'd never be able to concentrate or attend classes. Insurance has been an endless roll of red tape. Now that he's 21 he is no longer on Medicaid and has to begin the fight once more to begin treatment. Infusion therapy  which is his only option now is impossible without insurance coverage. Supplements to help him gain weight are expensive. Supplies after his surgeries has resulted in a great deal of debt that is barely manageable.  Please pray for Austin. Thank you for any help you can provide.,1460,15000,6,10,18,253,5

HELP GETTING HOME,https://www.gofundme.com/6d3um-help-getting-home,0,BRYAN,TX,Hi  My name is  Lynn   I;m currently struggling financially and other ways right now to get back to my home of Oregon. I recently just won my 2 year battle for disability for my constant chronic pain and depression/anxiety.  For the last 4 years since the death of my precious granddaughter  my life has continuously gone down hill fast. She passed away from a rare genetic disease  called Gaucher. The evil disease  which I have since found puts me at a 17% higher chance of getting Parkinsons Disease than the average person!! On top of my cripling back disordersI  was my Angels primary fulltime caregiver and wasn't working outside my home. I gave up my booming online business to care for her full time as she had a lot of medically fragile issues. It's been a down hill struggle since then.I've  dealt with my health issues for over 20 years  and to watch my once capable body  who raised 2 children  1 as a single mother and provided for them as well as myself  was independent. Now  that person is gone. I've struggled for years with no insurance to get help for my chronic pain. I've lost many abilities  and that is not an easy thing to watch just disappear more and more each passing year.Recently I had a   a. I sought out help to get back on track for meds I was no longer able to afford  and to have them changed. It has helped some  but  I still have along road to go.While I was inpatient I lost my car  which I used for deliveries and Ubering to make help with a little cash to pay some bills  which are now way behind. Now I'm  with out an income or any way to go back to work  even part time. I'm  currently living with my mom  in Texas for the last 8 months. But she is now relocating and I'm unable  to go with. I am needing to move back to my home state where I was born and raised of Oregon. I have no way to get my stuff there  I will require a vehicle or at least a small U haul. I will have to have some living and travel expenses to make it. I don't want to do this late into the winter  as the drive for a disabled single woman can be dangerous. As  stated I just won my disability   but could be looking on upwards of 6 months before benefits come in. I still need my meds  which we all know can be outrageous. Asking for help and donations is the utmost humbling thing on earth. But i am having to ask for y'alls help  to survive to get back home to friends and family who can help me until I start receiving benefits and receive medicaid or medicare.  My travel is also urgent as I will no longer have a place to stay in a week or so. So I am asking for a hand up that I hope to be able to help pay forward once back on my feet. Thank y'all so much  for your donations  sharing and kindness. God Bless,245,3500,6,7,5,72,6
loose skinnnnnn removal,https://www.gofundme.com/loose-skin-n-tiddy-meat-removal,7,Summerville,SC,So as some of you may know  over the past year I've lost quite a large amount of weight  130 lbs total. An unforeseen side effect to that was a slight amount of loose skin. Also the (slightly embarrassing) discovery that I have a condition called gynecomastia  or male breast tissue formation. So  long story short im trying to raise some money to have the tissue and skin removed so that I can finally at the end of the day actually feel like this weight loss journey has been worth while. It's an embarrassing topic for me to even talk about so I feel weird even making a GoFundMe for it  but it has to happen. I can't continue to feel uncomfortable in my skin. Any donations help and are greatly  greatly appreciated. I don't know where else to turn to cover the medical expenses at this point. And this seems like my best option for success.,613,3500,6,18,17,237,6
Shawn&apos;s Livering the Finer Life,https://www.gofundme.com/livering-the-finer-life,9,FORTWORTH,TX,As many of you know Shawn Finer received a new liver on October 6  2018. He is home and on the long physical and mental road to recovery. His wife Laura and their children  Reid and Emmy are caring for him. In 2009  he began battling fatty liver disease and elevated liver enzymes. By 2017  he was diagnosed with non-alcholic fatty liver disease. A shock came when a liver became available and he went in for immediate transplant. Unfortunately  all of this comes with a cost. The average liver transplant cost approximately $740  000  and that's only the beginning. Even with insurance  which will cover a portion of the transplant costs  he still faces significant expenses related to the surgery. Post-transplant anti-rejection medications are very expensive  and they're just as critical to his survival as the transplant itself. With insurance  one medicine costs $1700 a month and the other combinations of meds are are over a $1000. Shawn has been hospitalized almost weekly for the past several months  which is an additional financial burden on his family.  He won’t be able to go back to work for a few months.If you can help Shawn and his family in anyway it will be much appreciated!,1045,10000,12,10,14,87,6

Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/5rrfeh-medical-expenses,0,SOLDOTNA,AK,My Daughter Brittney Payne was working and suddenly had several episodes and felt like she was going pass out while at work. She had 4 over a 45 minute time period. I was then called to come and pick her up to take her home to rest. Upon getting to her she still didn't feel well so I took her to the emergency dept and after several tests the doctor came in to tell us that she had a brain tumor and needed immediate treatment. They sent her by Jet to Anchorage where she stayed for several days and ended up having surgery to remove the tumor. She went thru surgery just fine. We did find out that the tumor is cancerous and now she will need to undergo Radiation and Chemo and will be starting them this week. She has her good days and bad days. As of right now medical bills are pilling up and so are her other bills. Her husband has just moved back up here to Alaska to be with her and help out with her almost 2yr old son.

Melissa has been diagnosed with stage 4 terminal breast cancer.

This for sure would be a dream come true for Melissa  Noah and Ben.Melissa is a fighter and is determined to prove the Dr’s wrong. The fight itself is going to be hard  and then the added stress of figuring out paying the rent  bills etc. I hope that this fundraiser can help lessen some of the stress and maybe help her make some extra special memories with her 2 sons Noah and Ben. So I am asking you to join me in helping Melissa with her fight against cancer and to help create those great memories with her 2 sons by making a donation and sharing this page with your friends too.

Young Couple Fighting for Life!!,https://www.gofundme.com/steve-and-pantina-nelson,0,MABLETON,GA,With the family's permission  I am asking for your help for my niece Pantina and my nephew-in-law Steve and their beautiful family!!!Nearly 20 years ago they fell in love and have remained by each other ever since. They dated for a while and then had Justin.  After moving to Georgia they got married in 2007 in the home they built among family and friends. They then had Myles and lastly Little Miss Harper. Their family was complete and they continued building their life trying to create a legacy for their children.  In December 2017  their lives would forever be changed. After a surprise trip for Steve's 45th Birthday they found out that he had cancer  specifics unknown they faced it head on together. In January he underwent emergency surgery that nearly killed him.   This is when we found out he had Stage IV Colon Cancer.  Through months of chemo he was showing progress  gained all his weight back and was looking and feeling great.  In June they were told he had tumors the had gotten bigger and some new tumors.   This was not something they wanted to hear but here they were again ready to face it head on. In July during his port study things would get even worst.  Under a lot of stress  mentally and financially Pantina thought she was having a heart attack and went to the ER to get checked out. After an EKG and blood test they ruled out any heart problems.  Due to the pain in her neck the doctor wanted to do a CT Scan to rule out blood clots.  The results were unreal...they found a mass in the center of her chest.   How can this be? She was scared and still trying to remain strong for her husband and her children.   A biopsy would report that the tumor in her chest was a malignant...Thymic Epithelial Neoplasm  it is a very rare tumor.So here we are a young couple with three beautiful young children.  Both facing the fight of their lives. Future uncertain they pray and keep fighting.  We need your help...when Steve was diagnosed he had to stop working and Pantina had to go back to work and try her best to take care of the financial responsibilities for the family along with help from family and friends.  Now as she faces her own battle she needs your help. She will have surgery on October 17  2018 and will be in the hospital for 3 days following 4 weeks of recovery.  I am asking that you please donate to the family.  All money raised will be used for the family's expenses.  No amount is too small and if you can't donate please pray for them.  Please  please share page!!!**We do not own rights to the song in the video,2590,25000,7,10,32,366,6

Jessica&apos;s Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/jessie039s-dba-bone-marrow-transplant,9,FANWOOD,NJ,November 4  2018My daughter  Jessica Yorkovich  was born with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)  a rare congenital bone marrow failure disease.  Failure of the bone marrow (the center of the bone where blood cells are made) to produce red blood cells causes DBA patients to become severely anemic.Jessica had been on medication for all of her life to help control her condition.  But  for the past 10 years  she has needed monthly blood transfusions to augment her red blood cell production.  As a result of these transfusions  she has iron deposits in her major organs (heart  liver  etc). To control this iron overload  Jessica has been on a chelation infusion 24/7 for the past year.  This chelation did not help reduce her iron overload.Her doctors are now concerned that she may be transitioning to aplastic anemia.Jessica is admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center where she is undergoing second round of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  As expected with chemotherapy  she is having a rough time with her symptoms and has developed heart failure and pneumonia.For the next many months  Jessica will be unable to work due to exposure to other individuals and having a weakened immune system.Her Mother is a  Special Education Teacher for the Deaf and Handicapped and is on family leave to take care of Jessica.  Her Father is a disabled war Veteran  who is unable to work. The family income has been greatly reduced.We are asking your help with Jessica and her family.  In addition to the limited family income  there are unpaid medical bills and it is also necessary to perform home modifications to ensure her safety over the next year while her new immune system develops.  In January 2019  she will not have health insurance due to her age.Thank you in advance for your assistance ... it is really appreciated.Peggy YorkovichUpdate: November 12  2018Jessica was taken for an TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) this morning.  They are concerned that she may have a heart valve defect that may need to be corrected.  A TEE allows a better/internal view of the heart's structure.  The doctors were unable to perform the procedure because she is in respiratory distress. Update: November 13  2018Finally some good news.  Sort of.  Jessica feels a little better today and the TEE was able to be performed.   The heart mitral valve defect was discovered.  One of the 2 valves was completely deformed and most of the work was done by the other part of the valve.The cardiologist feels that this can be controlled by medication for the time being.  Further evaluation and any treatment can be performed after she is discharged from the hospital.Update: November 15  2018Very unhappy little girl today.  She was expecting to come home today  but her blood counts are down  she has respiratory distress again  and nosebleeds. Another chest x-ray is going to be performed.Update: November 17  2018She's home!  Very happy to sleep in her own bed and see her puppy.   We definitely have a lot to be thankful this Thanksgiving.  Now the long road to recovery begins ...Thank you everyone for your help during these difficult times.  Happy Thanksgiving!,24080,75000,33,32,334,363,6
Clean water needed,https://www.gofundme.com/84k4a-clean-water-needed,2,LAFAYETTE,LA,"I’m asking for financial help for my parents (Gerald & Lori Ledoux) to help defray medical bills and the cost of repairs to their home. My dad  Gerald  recently had open heart surgery followed by complications  resulting in a longer hospital stay. Just a few days after he was discharged  a water pipe busted in the wall-- in the middle of the night-- resulting in damage to their home. Floors were removed and sheetrock cut. With his recent surgery  it was dangerous for him to be in that environment. They are currently living in a hotel  with no idea when they can return home.Their homeowner's insurance does not cover repairs to pipes or replacement of pipes. This is the second time in two years a plumbing issue has flooded their home. However  with the recent medical expenses  this issue just seems insurmountable. With all the extra bills  my Mom  Lori  is not able to work in order to help Pop with his recovery.  He still should not be left alone at this point.TESI WATER  for years   regularly sent out letters indicating that the arsenic levels in the water were too high.  My parents and their neighbors have endured discolored clothing  ruined appliances  and separately purchasing drinking water-- FOR YEARS. Instead of correcting the issue  TESI sold the customers to Lafayette Parish Waterworks  District North.Neither company claims responsibility for the many minerals and arsenic in their water  which has now caused a build-up of minerals and corrosion in all of the water pipes. Two plumbers have told them the whole house needs to have all the plumbing changed.  There is too much \gunk\"" in the pipes.  But blowing them out will put too much pressure on the pipes and likely cause another to burst because of the corrosion.  The insurance will not cover the cost of the new pipes. Their home has dirty water and little to no pressure.  They're forced to live out of a hotel to safely recover from surgery.Gerald has incisions that need to be kept clean to avoid infection and further complications.  Please consider donating any amount to help relieve them of all the added stress and bills they are now facing.  We thank you in advance. Shares and prayers are also needed and greatly appreciated.""",2855,20000,11,14,37,252,6
Peggy&#x2019;s Perilous Cellar Submerged,https://www.gofundme.com/peggys-perilous-cellar-submerged,2,GUILFORD,CT,It rained and rained and rained. The water had nowhere to go in the super-saturated ground so it seeped through the basement walls and ran in through the windows. The little sump pump tried to keep up but the GFCI decided it had had enough and took the liberty to shut down  relieving the pump of its duties. The water continued to pour in until the fire department arrived and pumped it out through many hoses. Many things were lost  including the submerged washer and dryer which we hope to be able to replace.  I love my sister  Peggy  and would like her and her daughter to be able to have clean clothes. Her friends and family would appreciate that  too!,1000,1000,19,100,10,32,6

Motorcycle Crash Medical Expense,https://www.gofundme.com/4xtk2h-motorcycle-crash-medical-expense,8,WESTSACRAMENTO,CA,Our brother Ed Puzankov was in a critical motorcycle accident on the night of October 6th. He was found unresponsive and rushed to the hospital  fighting for his life. Through the night the doctors preformed critical surgeries to keep him alive. The doctors described that Ed was an inch from death  yet more work is needed to be done for Ed to have a chance to even move his arm again. It is a miracle that Ed is still alive and with us today  but his recovery is still on the up and down in the hospital.Everyone who has the privilege of meeting Ed is immediately warmed to his caring personality. He has always thought of others before himself  being a walking example of selflessness through his Faith in Christ. He loves God and loves everyone he meets  even those that have sought to brought him and his family hardship. In our community  there is nobody more willing to help and serve than Ed from organizing serve day  to youth camps  and almost every event you can imagine that all bring joy to others. A world without Ed  is a world that grows a little dimmer. It is now our turn to be there for him. As you can imagine  the toll on him and our family is immense; our mother cannot even be there for him as she is fighting through recent health problems of her own. No matter the outcome  he will be burdened with tremendous medical bills which are still currently unknown. With your small donation  no matter how small  we can try to repay his remarkable kindness  although it can never amount to the impact he has had on everyone who knows him. All funds raised will be given to the Puzankov family (through his sister Elena) directly to help pay for Ed’s medical bills. He is the household income provider and now he will need time to heal before going back to work.He’s our brother and we love him so much. Please keep him and our family in your prayers during this time.If you would like to reach out to the Puzankov family and those closest to him with words of support  feel free to send us a message through GoFundme or send a direct message through instagram @tatyanagrellas and/or @lenakhash with your love  favorite Ed stories  or any photos or videos.,30823,30000,16,103,235,938,6
Brenda Beal&apos;s Cancer Help,https://www.gofundme.com/brenda-beal039s-cancer-help,1,LYNN,MA,My mother  Brenda Beal  was diagnosed with lung cancer about five months ago. My mother is a breast cancer survivor and lives with the BRCA 1 gene. After beating breast cancer my mother had major surgery to reduce the risks of cancer due to the BRCA 1 gene. We met with an oncologist who suggested we speak to a surgeon about removing her right lung. We scheduled the surgery the soonest possible (which was 6 weeks later) and unfortunately  cancer spread to her esophagus  windpipe  and heart and the surgeon was unable to conduct the surgery.  Alternative treatment will be chemotherapy and radiation. She is starting to get medical bills from this unexcepted treatment. My mother is not able to work and does not have a license. She is not one to ask for help but is the first to help whoever needs it. She asked me to set up a go fund me because she needs help and she also wants to be sure that if the treatments do not work that her children don't have the burden of funeral expenses. This is extremely tough for me to write up  considering the close relationship I have with my mother. But she believes that people will help her in her time of need. Your donations will go towards her treatments co-payments and out of pocket and living necessities. She is a survivor and I pray that she will overcome this disease.

Battling cancer &gt; 6 years,https://www.gofundme.com/battling-cancer-gt-6-years,1,WRENTHAM,MA,Over 20 years ago I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. I had surgery to remove the tumor followed by local instillation of chemotherapy. A follow up surgery was utilized to eradicate a small regrowth of the tumor a year later. After approximately 15 years  a follow up on a lump in my neck revealed neck cancer  involving tonsils and surrounding lymph nodes. Treatment at that time involved extensive chemotherapy and radiation. Just when things were looking good  “bang”   I was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. I have been receiving heavy doses of chemotherapy and radiation for the past 4 years. The outlook is not good. I have been forced to give up my full time job as well as my part time jobs. In addition  my wife is unable to work.  Caring for me has become a full time job transporting me to and from Dana Faber Institute  as well as caring for me at home. It has really struck a blow to our financial situation and I fear for our impending  economic fallout  which has already begun.  My wife and I bought an old fixer upper 22 years ago and fixed it up  our way  with our own hands. We love our little house and fear everyday that we may loose it to this disease. Any funds that we received would be applied to the mounting cost of living  especially our mortgage and medical co payments   and costs not covered by insurance.   There are many  including special nutritional intake  and numerous specialized hygiene supplies.  I have always worked 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet and have a hard time asking for help  but under the overwhelming odds I must swallow my pride and do what I think is necessary for the survival of my family. I feel like I am behind the ball so bad and should not have waited so long.  I would appreciate any help from those kind enough to give.  Thank you.,15790,15000,20,105,140,420,6

Miguel Camacho&apos;s Accident,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-miguel-camacho,3,GERMANTOWN,MD,On June 20  2018  I was the victim of a devastating accident which caused me to lose my right leg and much more.  While I was standing behind my car  a driver without a license hit me and pinned me between her car and my car.   This violent impact crushed and snapped my right leg off  fractured my left leg  and caused me serious and permanent spine injuries.  I also underwent neck surgery which requires me to have several pieces of metal in my cervical spine.  I could have been paralyzed.I am now constrained to a wheelchair.   In one instant  my life changed drastically.  Not being able to walk again is beyond what I can accept or even comprehend.   When I look down  I see that my left leg gone and see a new reality.  This tragedy comes with humiliation  shame  and embarrassment.  Not being able to go to the bathroom by myself and having to depend on other people to do normal and everyday tasks has impacted my lifestyle very much.While I am home today  I must depend on wheelchair ramps to go in and out of my own house and without the constant support of my family  I would not be able to do anything.To make things worse  after the accident I began to suffer from near blindness (I can only see about 20%)  glaucoma  and cataracts. The accident broke my glasses and up to this day I have not been able to get an ophthalmologist to come to these private facilities to provide me with an eye exam. Prior to my accident  I was an independent and healthy person.  I feel grateful for being alive today and feel like God has a purpose for me. My faith has grown stronger even though my circumstances are not the best  and far from ideal.I believe that there are good people in this world that are willing to help those in need. I am now one of those people in need.  I hope this never happens to anyone else and hope my message will reach you and ask that you please help me “get back” on my two feet.Thank you for your time and God bless you all.----El día 20 de junio del 2018 yo fui victima de un accidente automovilístico  el cual me causo perder la pierna derecha  y mucho  mucho más.  Mientras estaba parado atrás de mi carro  una conductora sin licencia vino repentinamente y me atropello  dejándome atrapado entre su carro y el mío. Este impacto violento me aplasto y voló de mi cuerpo la pierna derecha  me fracturo la pierna izquierda  y me ha causado varias lesiones permanentes en la columna. También tuve cirugía del cuello  la cual me exige tener varios pedazos de metal en mi columna cervical. He podido quedarme paralizado.  Ahora estoy constreñido a unasilla de ruedas. En un instante  mi vida cambio drásticamente. No poder volver a caminar es mucho mas de lo que puedo aceptar o comprender. Cuando miro hacia abajo veo que mi pierna izquierda no esta y me doy cuenta de mi nueva realidad. Esta tragedia viene con humillación y vergüenza  pues el no poder ir al baño yo mismo y tener que depender de otras personas para hacer cosas normales y diarias ha impactado mi vida mucho. Aunque este en casa el día de hoy  debo depender de rampas de silla de ruedas para entrar y salir de mi hogar. Si no fuera por el constante apoyo de mi familia no podría lograr hacer nada. Para empeorar las cosas  después del accidente comencé a sufrir de ceguera completa (ahora solo puedo ver aproximadamente un 20%)  glaucoma  y cataratas en los ojos. El accidente quebró mis lentes y hasta el día de hoy no he logrado que un oculista venga a darme una evaluación y un examen de vista  ya que estos especialistas no van a instituciones privadas. Antes de mi accidente yo era una persona saludable e independiente. Me siento muy afortunado por estar vivo el día de hoy y siento que Dios tiene un propósito para mí. Mi fe ha crecido y se ha fortalecido a pesar de que mis circunstancias no son las mejores  y están muy lejos de ser ideales.Creo que hay gente buena en este mundo que esta dispuesta a ayudar a los que están necesitándolo. Ahora yo soy una de esas personas. Desde el fondo de mi corazón espero que nunca le pase esto a nadie y espero que mi mensaje les llegue. Les pido que por favor me ayuden a volver a “levantarme”. Gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer y que Dios los bendiga.Sincerely Miguel Angel Camacho Vasquez,2000,20000,6,10,21,297,6

The other driver died from the accident  but miraculously Cherell survived. While she suffered no brain or vital organ trauma  her body was crushed by the impact.  She has already undergone one surgical procedure to repair the right side of her body  and her doctors believe that several more surgeries will be necessary. After the operations are completed  months of rehabilitation and therapy will likely be needed.As you may know  Cherell and her husband  Eric  have fostered several children and have worked hard to create a safe  loving environment for these at-risk kids. Eric had left his job to stay at home full-time to take care of the youngest children  causing Cherell to be the only source of income for her family.

Pache&apos;s Battle to Beat Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/pache039s-battle-to-beat-cancer,1,HOCKLEY,TX,I've created this page to raise money for my uncle  50 year old Rafael  also known as Pache. This man right here  before his illness took over him  everyone knew him for his drive. He was so hardworking  passionate  and full of love. Two years ago he was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer. He went through chemo and radiations  and won that battle. Unfortunately  this year the cancer has returned  very aggressively and has spread to his lungs. My amazing and dedicated aunt has had to stop working to take care of him. With this new Lung cancer  doctors are at a stand still on operating his mass in his esophagus  because he is just too delicate. I'm asking for donations for him  right now because they are just barely surviving. They are behind on medical bills  and unfortunately his insurance has not been the best therefore his treatments has been prolonged.  To be honest this fundraiser can go to medical costs  transportation to and from his appointments  and hopefully not  but in the case of the most tragic event  this family could have a peace of mind knowing they have something for that unexpected event. Please find it in your heart to help this this amazing man right here  and God Bless You.,1805,15000,9,12,26,234,6

Handicap accessible van,https://www.gofundme.com/9q5zud-handicap-accessible-van,7,BANGOR,ME,My father has suffered from Multiple Sclerosis for 26 years. MS is a unpredictable  often disabling disease of the central nervous system that results in the immune system eating away at the protective covering of nerves. This disease has many symptoms but the major ones are extreme nerve pain like constant pins and needles and tingling burning sensations all over the body  loss of strength  and severe fatigue and vertigo issues. Luckily my fathers illness has been a slow and steady progression but is now at the point where he can no longer walk and is completely relient on his power chair. Just the transfer from his recliner to his power chair or the chair to the car has become very dangerous and he has had many falls. Over the last few years he has basically lived in his recliner unable to go anywhere other than his doctors appointments due to the energy and dangers of trying to leave the house. My father worked for many years at the Bucksport Mill until MS took his job  he is also a Navy veteran and has received amazing gifts from the VA like the power chair itself and they will also  pay for a vehicle to become handicap accessible. The only problem is he would need a van to have this done and with the income he gets from disability we are unable to afford this. Having a van will give my dad so many opportunities of visiting friends and family that he has lost. Due to the MS my dad didn't get to watch my sister and I graduate from college  he has missed all of his grandchildren's birthday parties and all the big family events  and hasn't been able to travel to any of his favorite places in Maine in years. My dad is an amazing man who has done so much for so many people and I would love to be able to do this for him in return. I completely understand anyone unable to afford a donation but just a share of this page or a prayer sent our way would make a difference. Thank you to everyone who took their time to read this -Kaylee,1769,20000,6,9,18,250,6

Dad&apos;s Leukemia Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/dad039s-leukemia-treatment,9,SPRINGFIELD,NJ,Last July  our dad was rushed to the hospital for severe pain and weakness. After several tests  they had to put him in the ICU as they couldn't figure out what he had. He had fluid in his lungs and when the blood test came back  his platelet count was low that the doctors initially thought it was dengue. After more procedures were done  dengue was ruled out and the hematologist informed us that he has leukemia. They administered antibiotics for the fluid in his lungs and ordered an MRI  which was how they discovered some blockages in his heart that required immediate action. So after some transfusions to get his blood to a safe level  the cardiologist performed angioplasty and removed the major blockage (and some small ones as well); but because our dad's blood level was dropping to dangerous levels  the cardiologist wasn't able to remove the other blockage. He had to postpone the procedure for another date. He recommended that the next angioplasty be done after his leukemia had been addressed. Working in conjunction with the hematologist  he had prescribed a heart medication as maintenance until then. At this point  our dad had already been in the ICU and also in isolation for about 2 weeks.When dad had recovered from the angioplasty  the hematologist discussed the treatment that he knew was best for him given his age and heart condition - low-dose chemotherapy. He advised us to have it started as soon as possible. After deliberating  we gave him the go  and he promptly initiated the first round of chemotherapy. For every chemo session  our dad has to stay at the hospital for at least 5 days. So in total he had been confined for 26 days  which included some days post-chemo to see how he was reacting to the treatment. Before he was discharged from the hospital  his hematologist and his cardiologist talked to us about the importance of getting a CBC (Complete Blood Count) done every other day to monitor his blood levels. Significant drop of his platelet and/or hemoglobin count requires blood transfusions to prevent a potential heart attack. The trip to the hospital (Cavite to Bonifacio Global City) could take hours given the traffic situation in the Philippines  which sadly  also takes its toll on dad. On August 23rd  he had to be admitted at the hospital due to low hemoglobin count. Currently  our dad is at the hospital for his 3rd round of chemo. When he checked in  his blood levels were so low that he required a lot of transfusions. He's had fever on and off  so they haven't administered chemo yet  and he's been there for 6 days now. For dad's medications  procedures  and prior hospitalizations (angioplasty  2 rounds of chemo  CBCs  and transfusions)  all bills have been paid using his savings. He's been retired for a couple of years now and didn't really think his savings would all go to this. Nobody really thinks something like this could happen to them  until it does  right? So we've decided to set this account up  because we are aware that we need all the help we can get in raising the funds to continue his treatment. We aren't sure how long it would take to completely heal his leukemia; and as we all know  hospital stays  tests  procedures  medicines  chemotherapy  and doctors' professional fees don't come cheap. Right now his hematologist is recommending another form of treatment that is more expensive  but he says is more aggressive. We implore for your generosity and support and would value any help you could extend us in these trying times. We thank you in advance and may God bless us all!- Grace  Sheryll  and Atoy,6896,26000,8,27,38,382,6
Elena Caragiu,https://www.gofundme.com/elena-caragiu,6,CHARLOTTE,NC,I am having a brain tumor surgery on October 18.   I was not ready for this sudden crisis and need your help  and I need it fast: the surgery is this coming  Thursday!! Although I monitored for 14 years this meningioma tumor growing slowly  last MRI showed a dangerous enlargment (6X5X3 cm) that cannot be treated with radiation.  I completely lost my balance   I am falling  every other day  and  when I am walking in the house I am holding on walls and furniture. Because of my age I've tried to postpone this dangerous surgery  but I cannot live anymore as a crippled person. Please  help me with the treatment cost ( post -op  daily therapy  rehabilitation after surgery  and the co-pay of costly  specialists visits). Medicare pays only  80%  of this scary craniotomy  and the in home care therapy and alternative treatments are not covered at all.,3405,7000,12,49,27,173,6
Help out Josh Walker,https://www.gofundme.com/help-out-josh-walker,7,OOLTEWAH,TN,Our friend  Josh Walker  woke up last Sunday and couldnt get out bed. When taken to the hospital  he was diagnosed with a rare nerve syndrome called Guillain Barre syndrome.

Transplant for Ted,https://www.gofundme.com/transplant-for-ted,9,PONCACITY,OK,Ted is a native of Ponca City and recently retired from The City of Ponca City after 37 years of employment. He is loved by many  including his wife  children  and 5 grandsons. 30 years ago  Ted was blessed with the gift of a donated liver and was able to undergo a transplant. Unfortunately  Ted is in need of another transplant and recent complications have resulted in more surgeries/hospital stays/procedures. His wife maintains a full time job  assists with his medical needs  and must take time off work when complications arise.

Jamie&apos;s Battle Against Leukemia,https://www.gofundme.com/jamie-kerr,8,GERRARDSTOWN,WV,Jamie is a loving  compassionate and outgoing eleven-year-old.  On September 13  2018 he was diagnosed with Acute B Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  Just the realization of the diagnosis and the doctor’s telling him and his family this was devastating to say the least.  This is something that has been mentally draining on a child so young as well as his parents and two sisters.  He has undergone a bone marrow biopsy and will also need to be subjected to more in the future as well as lumbar puncture procedures. He has had a blood transfusion and may need more as his treatment moves forward.  He is currently receiving chemotherapy and as you can imagine the treatments are very difficult physically and mentally.  He will undergo a multitude of chemotherapy rounds  which are undetermined in number and length of time thus far  at The Children's Hospital of DC.  As you can imagine  the upcoming months and/or possibly years will be unimaginably difficult for Jamie and his family.       Jamie’s parents  Jimmy and Missy  also have two daughters  Logan and Jordan.  The Kerr family has come together to support each other during this challenging time  but there is only so much they can do on their own.  The costs of dealing with this  medical bills  traveling  lodging  missing work  and a million other things  is overwhelming.  We are asking for support from friends  extended family  and a loving and caring community to help alleviate some of the financial burden that Jimmy and Missy are facing during and after Jamie's treatment.  Any amount of money can help and is deeply and greatly appreciated. In addition we ask for your thoughts and prayers to help Jamie and his family through this difficult and trying time to get Jamie healthy again. Thank you very much for your contributions be it through thoughts and prayers  monetary donation. and/or by sharing this as much as possible with any and every one you may know. Just the kindness of sharing this may be what makes an amazing difference to give the Kerr family the help they need.

Strong-willed Sister Fights Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/ForJelynne,1,4600,PH,When I was a young boy  my mother once described my sister as having the temperament of a “tiger”. For the most part  I honestly believe that was a spot on description. She has that innate self-confidence and elegance that is similar to a magnificent tiger in the wild.For me  this combination of tenacity and elegance is what makes my sister one of a kind and someone I look up to. These very qualities are the very same reason she survived life’s ups and down.My sister became a Mom to her two kids (Thea and Jarrett) when she was quite young and she had to grow up faster to be able to take of them well. Nonetheless  this did not deter her from finishing her education  becoming a Registered Nurse and a Registered Midwife. And becoming the best Mom  woman and wife that she can be.  (On duty  2008)(Althea's Middle School Graduation in Toronto  2017)Life has unexpected ways of making you realize how precious it is and for me and my family  it was the series of “tragedy” in the family that made us realize that. We lost an aunt (paternal) and uncle (maternal) last year both due to cancer. While the aunt of my sister’s husband also died of cancer earlier this year. The greatest loss in our family happened in March when our dear grandmother passed away. My sister had to come back home to the Philippines as being the first grandchild in the family  she was very close to our late grandmother and it broke her heart when she died. In her first few weeks here in the Philippines and right after the death of our grandmother  she experienced allergic rhinitis and incessant coughing  which did not worry her that much at first. However  she noticed that there were lumps on her neck that didn't seem to go away even with antibiotics and this got her worried.Hoping for the best  a series of tests were conducted (chest x-rays  several blood works  numerous stains  three CT Scans and two biopsies). A few months later  she was diagnosed with Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma Grade 1. Hodgkin's is a type of lymphoma  which is a blood cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. It is a relatively rare cancer but highly treatable with great prognosis when treated in the early stages.Being a natural fighter  my sister’s initial worry was not really for her  but for her children  her husband and the family that she would be leaving behind if she did not face this battle head on. My sister opted to seek treatment here in the Philippines as her husband is serving in the US Navy and is currently away (deployed).(One of those 'see you again soon' moments at the airport.)Our mother is currently the one taking care of her and accompanying her to chemotherapy sessions in Metro Manila. This GoFundMe page will be used for:- Treatment Expenses. Their insurance is covering only some of the cost of the treatment and almost all of the costs are still up for reimbursement. Update: Their insurance will not cover anything as she is seeking her chemo treatments in a more practical but not affiliated to their insurance provider in the US. - Travel Expenses. She is currently residing and recuperating in our home province but she travels to Metro Manila (approximately eight hours away) for her chemotherapy sessions. - Additional expenses such as oral medications and supplements.- Donations to the Lymphoma Philippines Foundation. My sister is currently looking forward to donate and help other lymphoma patients in our country. She also wants to raise awareness regarding this affliction. Any amount donated will be greatly appreciated and will go to a good cause. If it is not too much kindly share this campaign as well. We also appreciate prayers and any other support that can be offered to my sister.Knowing my sister  her current battle with cancer is merely one of those challenges in life that she will face head on and unfazed.,4720,10000,6,47,58,913,6
Medical Cost for Hamzah Tarawneh,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-cost-for-hamzah-tarawneh,5,BIRMINGHAM,AL,On Tuesday  October 2  2018  Hamzah was driving  when he ran out of gas. As he was walking on the side of the road  in the direction of the nearest gas station  he was struck by a pickup truck. The driver of the truck did not stop. Instead  he sped away from the scene. Another driver thankfully witnessed the hit-and-run accident and called 911 while in pursuit of the black pick-up truck. Unfortunately  the witness could only write two of the license plate numbers down. The police are still searching for the black pick-up truckAs a result of the hit-and-run  Hamzah was left in critical condition for several days. He is currently in stable condition - in a sedative state - while on a ventilator to assist his breathing.His road to recovery is predicted to be long and strenuous. Hamzah has already undergone leg surgery after his tibia was shattered in the accident. He also has ruptured blood vessels in his brain  causing mild swelling and pressure on his brain; a punctured lung; a lacerated liver; and road rash covering his body  which makes even the slightest of movements excruciating for Hamzah.Hamzah is an open-minded  outgoing person who is loved by everyone who meets him. He is an incredibly loving person who leaves a smile on everyone's face.  We are asking everyone for support during this difficult time. Hamzah does not have medical insurance and will have substantial medical bills as he begins the healing process. Any contribution  small or large  will make an incredible difference to Hamza and his family as they prepare for the incredibly long road to recovery.  All of the money raised will be used to cover Hamzah’s medicals bills  including  but not limited to  his hospital bill and therapy for his mobility.,32105,100000,14,32,407,2000,6

Well now he is in need of help so he can heal as well. On the eve of his birthday  Jason had an accident when his scooter hit a pothole  resulting in a broken femur and impacted hip. He is heading into emergency surgery with at least four days of hospitalization. This will lead to dr. bills  time lost from work  and more costs as he recovers. He had hoped to have an epic party to ring in his 44th year. Instead  the hope is that you will pitch in the money you may have spent buying him a beer and celebrating with him (or more if you can) to kick off the fund.  The initial limit is just $1k  but I will adjust the amount we need to raise as soon as some numbers come in. There won't be a cap  so please be as generous as your wallet affords. Any bit helps!(Ps. Some of you may be like \who is this girl setting up this fund? Can I trust her\""?.

Isaiah&apos;s Fight Against Leukemia,https://www.gofundme.com/isaiah039s-fight-against-leukemia,1,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,Hi everyone It is with a heavy heart that we regret to inform you that our dear friend Isaiah Andrews has been diagnosed with leukemia. His exact diagnosis was a rare form known as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). He began his first session of chemotherapy on Saturday  October 6th. The most recent information we have is that he will undergo a 10 day chemotherapy treatment and will spend the next six weeks in the hospital. After which  it is expected that he will be transferred to Colorado for a bone marrow transplant. It is unfair that a person as intelligent  humble  genuine  and selfless  as Isaiah  must undergo such a terrible disease. As you may imagine  the price of cancer treatment is unforgiving. We do not believe it necessary for him or his family to worry about the financial implications of treatment at this time. The funds will be used to help pay for his medical costs including chemotherapy  various radiological scans (CT scan  X-rays  etc.)  a bone marrow transplant  and other pending medical costs. His focus and the focus of his family must be centered around him winning this battle against cancer. Any donations would mean the world to us and his family. At this time  we ask that you respect his privacy and please contact Patrick Zedalis  Alek Gallegos  Marci Garcia  or Tyler Wolf with any questions or concerns.,10534,50000,24,21,147,319,6
Heide Halik,https://www.gofundme.com/heide039s-hope,1,CROWNSVILLE,MD,I am making this request on behalf of my dear friend  Heide. Several years ago  she received the news no one is ready to hear  “You have cancer.” And while this was a huge curve ball thrown her way  I watched her walk through aggressive surgery and treatment with grace and poise. She was able to endure the hardship through God's love and the support of family and friends. Being a self-employed woman  she trusted God's provision and saw His faithfulness to meet all of her needs through the generosity of many! Yet three years later  Heide is facing the dreadful diagnosis a second time. The ovarian cancer has returned  and while it is difficult news to digest  once again  she is looking to the Lord for guidance and strength.After much prayer and research  Heide is moving forward with surgery and additional treatments to combat the source of the cancer as well as to strengthen her immune system. This will take place intensively over the next several months with additional treatments over the coming year. Some of those treatments may take place outside the Annapolis-Baltimore area. Currently  due to developing symptoms – especially fatigue and pain – she has had to discontinue working  leaving her without income. Unfortunately  her treatments are expensive and some will not allow for insurance reimbursement.Because these circumstances will leave her financially depleted  I am asking you to consider contributing to her cause. At the urging of several friends she has allowed us to post this on her behalf. We want to raise $50 000 to cover medical and living expenses while she undergoes treatment. I ask you to consider supporting Heide financially. If you are not able to contribute financially  please encourage her in any way you can including  cards or notes  or most importantly prayers as her faith in God is strong and she believes in the power of prayer. I pray a blessing on each one of you reading this  may you know the joy and grace of God and rest in His peace and love.,12267,50000,21,25,52,141,6

After a trip to the Doctor’s office  it was learned that brad had a mass growing in his abdomen that was causing all his discomfort. After some additional testing  Brad was given his diagnosis of Burkitt’s Lymphoma.Burkitt’s Lymphoma is the rarest  most aggressive form of lymphoma  being diagnosed just over 1 000 times a year. Those are scary words to hear from your Doctor.Brad began intensive chemotherapy treatments last week and will be going through aggressive treatments for the next 4 months. This is going to be the definition of battling cancer.But  if you know Brad  you know that he is not going to back down from this fight. It’s not going to be easy  but Brad is going to kick cancer’s a**.I understand that asking for your hard earned money is awkward and forward  but  I don’t want Brad and Audrey to have to worry about money when they should be focusing on Brad’s fight.Again  thank you for taking the time out of your day and thank you for your help and support for the Mensen family during this trying time.For additional information  please visit the link:   https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caringbridge.org%2Fvisit%2Fbradmensen&h=AT2XLrmPck63uMRPs7QsQhFm5pTyM89RcHTr9wUzUcto9nRc8E4tE9H2EavPYqKlvHwLnsN_HgcdQQ5-3Eu_LPoKd6IfQ6fwv-hJ6AT3D7uwH93yIL09NppLBWvyOAaE-A,7480,8000,19,94,132,427,6

Emergency moving &amp; living expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/emergency-moving-amp-living-expenses,0,HOWELL,NJ,THEY SAY IT TAKES A VILLAGETo be honest I never thought isI have to do something like this and for days really weeks I have been struggling with whether I should or not. I don't really know where to start or how much to say vs. not say but I do want to make this about my 2 beautiful little girls  Gianna who is 7 and Alivia who is 5. Unfortunately life doesn't always go as planned and marriages don't always make it through storms of hardship. Regardless when children are involved they always need to come first. Sadly not all parents realize that....hurt  spite  addiction  anger and many other things can cloud people's judgement of right and wrong and as nicely as I can say it that is what happened to my life to my family and to my little girls. Their father chose to start a new life and forget about his responsibilities and obligations to his children. He chose to let his children lose their home that they have lived in their entire lives. While we have been separated for quite a long time what I thought was a divorce putting the Children First was actually a man calculating and planning behind my back to do everything he could to make sure he had a new home for himself and money all while not worrying about his children's needs. I was blindsided and because of this I found out 3 weeks ago we were being evicted for non-payment of rent. I went to court on Friday and I watched him blankly stare and not care as I cried to the judge that I had nowhere to go with my children and the judge told me unfortunately there is nothing he can do. I now have less than 2 weeks to pack an entire house and find a new place for my girls and also pray that I can find a landlord understanding enough to give us a chance and a new start. That being said because everything that has happened I am left with basically nothing and have to pull a miracle off in more ways than one and is ashamed as I am to admit it I can't do this off financially on my own between the expenses of moving security deposit for new place and now fully supporting a household and my girls on my own so I am looking for help in any amount so that I can get us started and on our feet. With love and hopeDanielle,1190,5000,8,24,13,140,6

Matt Rosenberg&apos;s Brain Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/wn9xtw-matt-rosenberg039s-brain-cancer-fund,6,HIXTON,WI,On June 4  2018  after suffering for months with symptoms of headaches and lethargy  Matt  along with his loved ones  discovered through an MRI he had a massive brain tumor.  This tumor was so large it appeared to be taking up 25% of his brain mass and was beginning to push into his skull.  This scary revelation shockingly came the day before his wife of three years  Keaton  was due to give birth to their first child.   It was recommended by the surgeon that Matt undergo brain surgery as soon as possible  as the tumor was putting pressure on the area of his brain that controlled all functioning and the risks of seizures  blindness  and paralysis were imminent.  Matt and Keaton made the difficult decision to induce Keaton two days later  June 6  to allow Matt to be there for the birth and schedule his surgery thereafter.  Their beautiful baby girl was born on June 8 and Matt had his brain surgery on June 26  the day before his 33rd birthday.  Matt’s surgery was successful in removing a large portion of the tumor; however  after biopsy there was a devastating diagnosis of a Grade 4 Glioblastoma  an aggressive brain cancer.  This is the same cancer that sadly took Senator John McCain’s life this past August.  Since the surgery Matt has undergone physical and occupational therapy and months of aggressive radiation and chemotherapy.  He will continue to be on chemotherapy for six more grueling months.  Matt has not been able to work since his diagnosis and will not be able to work for the foreseeable future.  As tragic as this diagnosis is  especially in the direct foreshadow of the birth of his baby girl  Matt continues to try and remain positive  happy  grateful  enjoy his family  and push through the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.  It is not easy  but Matt continues to inspire us all. Extending Matt love and positivity during this difficult time means everything to him and his family and they truly appreciate all gestures  big or small.  If you can donate  all funds will go toward his medical treatments and caring for Vada Lea  his precious baby girl.  Thank you so much.,15755,50000,10,32,123,1000,6

Also he was admitted at Castle Hospital  but because he has no insurance  even under poor conditions  they sent him home without extra care well needed.  Maurilio also expressed his desire to go back to his home land  Brazil. Hopefully this fund raiser will be sufficient to pay for his cataract surgery  some nurse care and plane tickets.,2760,9000,14,31,24,126,6
Donnie&#x2019;s Medical Leave DENIED,https://www.gofundme.com/donnies-medical-leave-denied,6,PEORIA,AZ,￼￼￼Please read its entirety as it explains everything and the pictures show my dad's front and side views of his 4th cantaloupe size hernia that needs repaired and his side wound from his previous surgeries in 2013 that was caused by Necrotizing Fasciitis (flesh eating bacteria) and as a lot of you already know my dad  Donnie Bakken has been out on short term disability since 6/19/18. Due to his 4th abdominal hernia along with the large wound on his right side  this has caused him such unbearable pain and discomfort and is unable to sit or stand for a long period of time. His only comfort is when he is laying down or in the pool. The past two months it has been at its worst and it took us that long just to find surgeons to do the surgery. Many surgeons have repaired these size hernias and have done a stomach reconstruction before but none have done these surgeries with the repaired hole Donnie has on his right side. The large corporation he works for preaches health & wellness but apparently Cigna which handles their Short Term Disability insurance doesn’t feel the same. Cigna approved his STD from June to August and on 8/18/18 they decided to deny it. Nothing has changed from then but us finding surgeons willing to due this surgery to give my dad relief and some kind of life back. Cigna stated there is not enough clinical evidence to extend beyond 8/18. So he hasn’t had a paycheck for 7 weeks. So no deductions for insurance  taxes etc for just as long. Cigna has requested additional medical info for their medical reviews. Which the surgeons office has always complied! They stated if they need more info they will be reaching out to the surgeons office. Not once have they contacted them for more info  they just keep denying the claim. So now he has to do an appeal which will take from 30 - 45 days. Without any pay. He finally has his 8 hour surgery with 3 surgeons scheduled for Thursday 10/11/18 with a recovery time of 8 weeks. Cigna also stated if his STD claim is denied now  they will not cover his 8 week surgery recovery time either. They have been scraping by and now has run out of money to pay bills. He absolutely never asks for anything  especially help and if you know my dad  he would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. This makes me just sick and so sad as my parents are nearing the age for retirement and just to meet the deductible to make this surgery possible  they have had to pull out of 401K. My dad said “These last two months have been the worst months of his life” and if you know my dad  he isn't a negative person and this has brought him and my mom so much stress and low mentally. We would appreciate anything you could donate and as always please send good thoughts and prayers our way... Thank you!,1325,6000,10,22,16,133,6
Help For Dean&apos;s 3rd Heart Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-dean039s-3rd-heart-surgery,9,FRONTROYAL,VA,"Meet Dean!!!From his parents:Our son  Dean  was born February 8  2016. He was prenatal diagnosed with congenital heart defect (CHD) called Hypo-Plastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)  meaning that the left side of his heart is underdeveloped and does not function properly. At three days old he had the first of a series of three open heart surgeries. The first was called the Norwood  and the second is called the Glenn  which he under went when he was four months old. Since then  after a few setbacks including an emergency life flight to Children’s National Medical Center in DC  he has gotten to grow and play as much as any other little kid. At a recent Cardiology check up we were informed the time has come for the third surgery  called the Fontain. This surgery joins the Inferior Vena Cavity and Superior Vena Cavity to the right Pulmonary Artery. The purpose is to separate oxygen Rich and oxygen poor blood within the heart and allow better blood flow to the body. We have been warned that this is the hardest surgery to recover from as his body takes time to adjust to the new blood flow. He’s also bigger and more aware which will make it harder for us to help keep him still to heal. We know we serve a big Lord though  who has already written out Deans story and we are trusting Him to help us make the right choices for Dean.--------------------We are raising funds to help support Dean and his family. All the proceeds will go directly to their family to be used for: medical bills  food and lodging  time off work  and other bills. Any amount that you can donate will be a huge blessing  and we are so very thankful that you're partnering with us in this venture as we pray for Dean and his family throughout this process.If you would like to donate via PayPal (to avoid the fees that GoFundMe takes from each donation) you can send your donation to mcarrigan04@gmail.com .

Support for Antoinette Rogers,https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-antoinette-rogers,1,SPARTA,NJ,Antoinette Rogers is an incredible mother  daughter  wife  sister  aunt  and friend to everyone who is lucky enough to have her in their lives. Those close to her are aware of the challenges she has faced in recent years  but for those who may not know  Antoinette was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 at age 32. She is now battling once again  as her cancer returned in 2018  this time spreading to her liver. Our sister is facing one of the most difficult battles in her young adult life.Antoinette has two beautiful children  Kellen (age 4) and Katie (age 3). It was shortly after Katie was born that Antoinette learned she had stage 2 breast cancer  and the fight began. She went through intense chemotherapy treatments  radiation  and multiple surgeries. All the while she held down her full-time job and health insurance  but medical bills and other expenses have continued to accumulate.Antoinette's been fighting hard with help from her husband Brian  the rest of her family and great friends at her side. She was in remission for almost two years  before finding out the disease had metastasized. It progressed from stage 2 to stage 4  a shock after she took every precaution she could. While cancer-free for a period  many obstacles still remained  so the fight had never really stopped  but it’s even more serious now.One of Antoinette’s finest qualities is her generosity.  Despite such a difficult journey in her own life   she has still put forth remarkable effort toward the cause of fighting cancer everywhere.  Not only has she dedicated time to educate others about donating to the American Cancer Society  she has personally raised thousands of dollars and even was recognized by her company with an award for volunteerism.She has never lost hope for herself  or for others dealing with cancer. Meanwhile her family and friends will never lose hope for her  as she tackles this tough situation. Antoinette will receive some form of chemotherapy for the rest of her life to manage the disease from spreading. She currently undergoes weekly infusions  which take a physical and financial toll – and also time apart from her children.Many already have assisted Antoinette in various meaningful ways  and she and her family are extremely grateful for those people and organizations. Still  many more have reached out asking how they can support her. This page was created for that purpose. Every contribution helps alleviate some of the monetary burden that comes with fighting for her life  so she can focus more energy on doing just that. Thank you for reading about Antoinette’s story – your love and support is greatly appreciated.Sincerely Antoinette's family <3,16275,20000,17,81,210,843,6

A Cure for Corinna,https://www.gofundme.com/comfort-for-corinna,1,ERIE,PA,My cousin Corinna is a 39 year old  single mother who has recently been diagnosed with stage 2  grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma after finding a lump in her breast. She is a strong and loving individual and her three girls are her life.  Providing for them and being the best mom she can be  is and always will be  her main priority. We want nothing more than to get her healthy! We don't yet know the full extent of the battle that Corinna will be fighting.  Corinna was informed that  due to the aggressive nature of this cancer and her age   it would be extremely dangerous to do surgery without first treating with chemotherapy. This week  she had the port placed in order to begin chemotherapy.    Surgery will follow chemotherapy. Corinna is a fighter and will work as long as she is physically able  until the chemotherapy makes that impossible. She does not currently have health insurance through her employer and her Medicaid expires at the end of the month. As Corinna continues on this journey  we want her to focus fully on getting healthy and not be burdened with the added stress of medical expenses  loss of wages  and being able to provide for her children.Corinna will need all the support that she can get during this fight and we appreciate any prayers or donations that come her way.,225,5000,4,5,6,156,6
Joni O&apos;Donnell Clinical Trials,https://www.gofundme.com/joni-o039donnell-colon-cancer-help,1,PEQUOTLAKES,MN,Joni has fought and coped through all of the treatments  doctors appointments  and scans since she was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2016.  Surgeries and healing behind her  the cancer had spread into the lungs. Chemo was the only available option for treatment since and the news recently was reported that the cancer was growing even on the chemo. Through many weeks of searching and studying we have found some options for Joni's cancer treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  TX. MD Anderson has clinical trials that look very promising for her mutations. The immunotherapy that we had always been told would not work for her mutation is  currently being tested at MD Anderson. The best news is that Joni is eligible and scheduled to participate in this trial in just two weeks! The burden with this great trial is the travel back and forth to Houston. Having made the trip twice in just one week has cost well over $1500.00 already.  In order to participate in this trial  Joni will have to travel to Houston and back at least biweekly if things go as planned. Possibly more if there are complications. Let's help offset this financial setback so Joni can get back to fighting cancer and raising her two children.,3780,10000,20,38,30,92,6

Zachary Sutterfield&apos;s Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/zachary-sutterfield039s-recovery,0,FOLSOM,CA,I’ll never forget when I got the phone call.  It was June 20 at 5:12am.  It was my sister-in-law  DJ.  “Listen carefully ” she said.  I remember her saying something about a fire and that Zach’s missing.  “Don’t worry ” I said.  “He probably ran out in a rush  leaving his phone behind  and is wandering around somewhere  not even realizing you know about the fire and are worried.  Trust me  he’s fine.” He wasn’t. Zach was in the apartment directly across from where the fire supposedly started (to date  no official report has been released about the fire and its cause.  Zach was hurt.  Seriously hurt.   He has severe head trauma (which has resulted in two neurosurgeons – and more to come) and burns over 70% of his body.To date  Zach has spent over 80 days in the Brooks Army Medical Center's (BAMC) Intensive Care Unit near Fort Sam Houston  Texas.  He will be there at least another 150 days  if all goes well.  His injuries are severe.  The long-term effects of the head trauma sustained are still unknown.  This is only the beginning.Life as my brother and his family have known it will never be the same. With each day  there seems to be a new sense of “normal.”  Hearing “your son is the victim of a major apartment fire and has sustained severe injuries” is a phrase no one wants to hear.  We can’t imagine the shock  the pain.  They felt it.  Then they recovered.  “OK.  We can handle this.”  A new ‘normal’ evolves.   Next it’s the news about the head injury . . . “OK.  We can handle this.”  A new ‘normal’ evolves.   Next  it’s the news about the depth of the burns . . . “OK.  We can handle this.”  A new ‘normal’ evolves.   Next  it’s the news about the surgeries . . . skin grafting  after skin grafting  after skin grafting (18 major surgeries to date  no knowing how many more are to come).  “OK.  We can handle this.”  A new ‘normal’ evolves.  With every piece of news  a new ‘normal’ evolves.  His parents cope  deal  and accept.  They stay strong.  They must – for Zach’s sake. The future of Zach’s family is beyond uncertain.  DJ and Karl work in San Angelo  Texas  which is about a 4-hour drive from Fort Sam  Houston.  They can’t return to work; not while Zach’s future is uncertain.  As of today  day 80  Zach is still in BAMC's burn unit.   Doctors remind his parents daily that  although they may see snippets of progress (there are moments between medication that Zach seems more lucid than others; he’s even been able to tall his parents that he loves them!) doctors continue to remind Karl and DJ that there is still only a 50/50 chance of survival for Zach.  His future is still not much better than the flip of a coin.  They hope.  They pray.  Then know – he will beat this.  He has to.Zach’s future is unknown.  We’re not sure  once he makes it out of the Burn Unit ICU and deals with recovery what that means.   What will his needs be to adapt to his new “normal?”  Will he need assistance?  We don’t know yet  but we know he will need help.I am asking for help.  Lots of help.  Help for Zach’s family and help for Zach’s future.  Here’s is what I think they will need (although I’m sure I’m missing several things that quickly add up!)·         Cost of living income – DJ and Karl’s stay at Fort Sam Houston is indefinite.  As such  they will likely lose one income and possibly both.  I’m hoping to raise funds to help with this loss.·         Future medical – Since we don’t know how long he will need medical assistance  this amount is unknown and potentially unending. ·         Service Dog – Zach has a dog he loves dearly.  The family is hoping they can have him trained to become a service dog for Zach.  This training is not only time consuming  but also costly.·         Lifestyle adaptability – Since the extent of his injuries remain unknown  it’s hard to discern what his new needs will be.  Once Zach recovers  his family will likely need to have his living quarters adapted to fit his “new normal.” This will hopefully include voice activated electronics (light switches  etc.) so he can more easily navigate through his living quarters.·         Tuition Assistance -  Zachary had moved away from home just two weeks prior to the accident.  He was transferring from San Angelo University to Texas University  about 4 hours from home.  Due to the accident  Zach has obviously had to delay his college plans.  I want to ensure that  when he is ready  he will have the means to pursue his dreams.

A Father That&apos;s Fighting Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/A-Father-Thats-Fighting-Cancer,0,EUGENE,OR,Hello and thank you for checking out my GoFundMe! I'm making this page because something devastating has happened to my family. My dear father  Jerry Eisenbach  has recently found out he has cancer. At first  it was just a small tumor that the doctors thought they could just remove easily but come to find out it is a lot worse than they originally thought. They found more tumors in his kidney and the cancer has spread to his muscles throughout his lower abdomen. They just recently realized it has also spread to his bladder muscles and they have to remove his bladder for him to have a chance to survive. He's going into start chemo soon and due to having to stay in the hospital he can't work for a very long time. As you can imagine this is going to be very very expensive. We do not have an estimate yet sadly. On top of not being able to work and finding out he has cancer he just bought a new house  and he might have to give it up. If he gives up the house he has nowhere else to call home.  My father is the most loving and generous person I've come to know. Throughout my life  he has helped me through so many medical emergencies when I couldn't pay for them. Not only has he been as generous to help me with hospital bills he's also helped me with keeping my apartment for I am just a poor college student. He has been through so much throughout his life. He's had three back surgeries  two heart surgeries along with a major heart attack. He is not only the most amazing person I've ever known but he is also the strongest. I'm not asking for every person that stumbles upon this to donate but if you could please share that would mean the world to me and my family. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this and I hope you have a beautiful day! Tell your loved ones they are important  you have no idea what's going to happen. Smile Always Ashley Eisenbach,5557,50000,10,11,24,182,6

Family care and Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/3gf4s-medical-bills-and-needs,0,GILBERT,AZ,In January of this year  my husband and I found out that Kraig had a large mass on his liver.  We got it Biopsied to see if it was cancer and unfortunately 12 hours after his biopsy  he was bleeding a lot internally and had to spend a week in the hospital. After an angiogram and blood transfusions  the bleed was stopped  but this would only be a temporary fix. The mass was not cancerous  however it was a high risk of bleeding out again. It needed to be removed. In August  we got the medical leave needed with Kraig's job and on the 28th Kraig had surgery to have his mass removed.  He stayed in the hospital for 6 days and the 4th day Kraig was home  on the 7th of September  he was in a lot of pain most of the day. He kept complaining of sharp pain in his shoulder and said that he felt a lot of pressure in his stomach.Later that night  the drain he had in his stomach filled with blood within an hour after we emptied it. He was bleeding massively and I rushed him to the emergency room. He had to have 15 units of Blood rapidly transfused into him and have an emergency Angiogram surgery to stop the bleeding.  However this only slowed it. it didn't stop it. He seemed stable and they took him off the respirator Saturday night. I came to the hospital Sunday to find his room filled with people and I was told to sign papers to allow procedures to save his life right now.  He was put back on the respirator  couldn't breath and unfortunately was still bleeding. Monday we did a 3rd Surgery since the 28th.  He had a lot of fluid in his body and because he was opened up so soon after his surgery it was hard to tell what exactly was going on. He couldn't be fully closed up due to all of the inflammation. That following Friday  they went in again a 4th time to clean out the rest of the fluid and while that was happening  an artery vein blew and they found the bile leak that probably started the journey to the emergency room. I wish that was the end of it. However about a week later on September 17th I got a phone call at 5am that Kraig was massively bleeding and that I needed to come right away to the hospital and to bring other family. I was basically told that he was bleeding badly and they had already done 17 units of blood as well as additional bags of Plasma. He was in immense pain and they pulled him out of sedation so he could be ready to be put under for surgery. Everyone told me that the chances of him coming back were slim to none but everything would be done to save him. I told his surgeon and team that Kraig was way to stubborn to die and I stayed with him til they wheeled him off to surgery for the 5th time. They spent over 6 hours operating on Kraig. This time they finally removed the entire right lobe of his liver since nothing could be done at this point to keep it from bleeding out. I was a wreck and it was very difficult to stay calm for the kids. I don't think I have always been that. I have been so fortunate to have some amazing neighbors to help me out.Kraig was thankfully able to be taken out of Sedation Friday on the 21st. He was stable enough to be allowed to wake up and finally talk to us. I was able to let the kids finally see their dad on the 22nd. Unfortunately he still had a bile leak. While the bleeding was finally taken care of his drain bags were filling up with Liver bile and his kidneys are still not functioning after the MANY times of massive blood loss. We decided to transfer him to a hospital about an hour away to do a procedure  to place in a couple of metal stints to hopefully fix the bile leaks so we can focus on getting him home. That was his 6th surgery. I wish I could say that it worked but the bile leak now seems to be even worse. We have had no choice now but to transfer Kraig to Tuscon Arizona to a university hospital leading in liver care and surgical treatments but  he is now almost 2 hours away from me. Unfortunately today is the 29th day now that he has been in the ICU.  He has had 5 operations since the original on the 28th of August making this a total of 6 surgeries. Tomorrow  had the original surgery gone successfully  would have been the first day he would have gone back to work.  We unfortunately have a lot of bills piling up  and we just got word today that he will need to have a 7th Operation to fix this issue. I will know more details on the next operation hopefully tomorrow.  Most likely we will have to do a complete reconstruction of the bile duct in his liver. This will be a complex operation and they will have to go back in for it. However 2 things need to happen. His kidneys  his doctors would like to see back to functioning  and Kraig needs time to heal. He has had 6 operations in a month and his body just can not tolerate much more abuse.Chances are high that Kraig will probably be in the hospital for another week or 2 be sent home and then have this operation in 6 weeks time of today. Needless to say that SO many things can go wrong in between them with the bile leak however what I do know is it will be at least another 10 weeks before my husband can MAYBE go back to work. I hate asking for help but my husband is not going to work anytime soon. Any help financially will be hugely appreciated. We moved here a little less than a year ago. I don't have any friends or family near me to help me out and trying to juggle the hospital and the kids has been very tough. Kraig's co-workers and my neighbors have been very helpful to jump over in times of emergencies and surgeries and let the kids stay with them when I needed to be there for KraigI would also like to ask  anyone reading this to please donate blood. Kraig  out of all of this has used about 70 units of blood and over 30 units of plasma. Donating blood DOES save lives. If it wasn't for that  he definitely would not still be with me today.I will be posting up more details of everything that has happened on here including everything that has happened so far.  Again  thanks again for reading everything. Thanks so much for any help given.,4175,4500,12,93,31,188,6

Surgery for Sienna,https://www.gofundme.com/tajhba-surgery-for-sienna,9,BOISE,ID,"Sienna's story begins 4 years ago at a routine health check-up.  Through bloodwork the doctor discovers her platelet levels are low.  After seeing a hematologist they also reveal an enlarged spleen.  Month after month  year passes year we go in for tests  bloodwork  and seeing different specialists with no improvement.  The diagnosis was left at low blood platelets and enlarged spleen with an unknown cause.  As a mother I couldn't rest at that knowing something was not right  there had to be a reason  so we continued to pray and seek for the underlying cause.  Finally this spring  after moving to a different state we were led to see a GI pediatric specialist.  I was shocked when he said  \I think I know what it is.\""  After an ultrasound of her liver and spleen  it confirmed his diagnosis: Portal Vein Thrombosis.  The main vein feeding her liver clotted and scarred off at some point in her life.  Her body has compensated with smaller veins to continue to feed the liver but a large amount of the blood is backflowing into the spleen.  PVT is a rare condition and not well understood  so we were told we would need to go out of state for surgery to correct what the doctors call a \""ticking time bomb\"".  If left untreated the pressure can continue to build up in the esophagus and stomach causing bulging veins that  rupture and lead to life threatening hemorrhaging.  After researching this condition we discovered Dr. Riccardo Superina  considered to be the expert in Portal Vein Liver Bypass surgery. Dr. Superina will preform the surgery by taking one of her four Jugular veins from her neck and bypass the blockage to restore normal blood flow to the liver and relieve the pressure on the spleen and esophagus.  We will be traveling to Chicago on Sunday Oct. 14th to begin the pre-op imaging tests needed before the surgery set for Oct. 22.  The surgery will take place at Ann and Robert H. Lurie's Children Hospital in their liver transplant surgery center.  She will be in the ICU for several days  followed by a week in the hospital and a minimum of 2 weeks staying in the area for follow-up.  We're thankful to have insurance  but still have a deductible to meet  as well as travel expenses  meals and some lodging expenses.  We are planning on staying at the Ronald McDonald house for the majority of the time.  We are so thankful that the Lord hears and answers our prays  if you are unable to donate monetarily we would greatly appreciate your prayers for Sienna  her parents and siblings as we move forward trusting in His plans for her life.""",7035,12000,10,59,48,397,6

Help me keep beating the odds,https://www.gofundme.com/help-me-keep-beating-the-odds,7,FORTMYERS,FL,Hello  my name is Chet I have an extremely rare terminal Mast cell disease.  I'm constantly struggling with all the side effects that really effect everyday life.  Chemotherapy is like no other treatment.  Not only am I battling the various side effects of my disease   I have to contend with the challenges and complications of chemotherapy.Here's a little explanation of how Mast cells effect us either in positive  or negative ways.Mast cells are essential for all of us to heal a wound  combat pathogens  help with inflammation   immune tolerance as well as protect our blood and brain.  While mast cells remain dormant in all of you  they are not in me.  My mast cells activate just out of the blue and cause all sorts of issues.  They create a host of side effects for me that include struggling to breath  high fevers  vomiting  tremors  itchiness  loss of vision   fainting  upset stomach  bone pain and anaphylactic shock.  I keep an epipen with me at all times.  I also have lesions on the skin  my blood and bone marrow are affected along with internal organ involvement.Misery right?   I went from being a driven  productive  hard working   self sufficient individual  to the inability to basically support myself.I've had a Autologous stem cell transplant which is where the stem cells come from me.  This failed.  My current Dr's suggest an Allogeneic replacement where the stem cells come from a matched related or unrelated donor.I have huge out of pocket expenses I can no longer handle.  I need help. The funds will be used for medical procedures  very expensive medications including Gleevec  which I am currently on  and Rydapt just to name a couple.  Rydapt is specific to my disease.I'm not one to ask for anything.  It really humbles me to go this route.  I don't know what else to do  or who to turn too.  I'm on my own.  This disease is taking a toll on me.  The sad part is there's no cure  just progression.  If the campaign goal is achieved  I will donate $500 to The Mastocytosis Society.Thank you very much for taking the time to read my very condensed story.  I kept it short out of consideration for all who take the time to read.,1475,15000,37,10,7,5,6

Momma&#x2019;s Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/mommas-breast-cancer,0,NEWALBANY,IN,Over the course of 6 years my momma has been through numerous health problems. She is a fighter and continues to stay positive and fight through the most challenging times. One of the many challenges that come with health problems is medical bills. My moms journey began when she fell in 2011 and broke her leg. She had surgery  but due to the severity of her break she continues to have swelling still today. Six months following the break she developed a blood clot in her leg (the same one she broke) and had to be put on blood thinners.A short time after in November 2012 mom passed out at home. She was taken to the hospital where they diagnosed her with a stomach virus and low potassium. Mom was admitted overnight and I stayed with her. That night I awoke to mom chocking on her own vomit. I cleaned her mouth out the best I could and got her to stop choking  but she wouldn’t wake up. I got a nurse and after convincing them to do a CT scan they came back and let me know that her brain was bleeding. She stayed in the ICU for several hours then was transported to Norton for emergency brain surgery. Mom was born with a tangle of blood vessels (called an AVM) in her brain. This contributed to the aneurysm she had rupture in 2012. It took months of physically/speech therapy  but mom made it through. Just recently in July 2018  mom noticed something was going on with her right breast and I immediately got her in for a mammogram. After mammograms  ultrasounds  and biopsy’s we were given the devestating news that it was breast cancer. Momma underwent a masectomy in August where they gave the diagnosis of stage 3 invasive ductal carncenoma that had spread to 4/10 lymph nodes. Momma starts her chemo treatments on Thursday this week (10/11) and will as of now complete 4 rounds of chemo and 30-40 rounds of radiation. We are and will continue to try to fight this. Although mom has insurance it does not/will not cover everything. There is a long journey ahead of us and so many things going on that are scary and hard to deal with. I’m starting this gofundme in hopes of collecting some money to put toward the growing amount of medical bills to try to help alleviate some of the stress of making sure everything is taken care of. I can’t even begin to put our story into written words  but it is a long and trying one. Momma and I both struggle to ask for help  but I am trying to do anything I can to fight through this with her. Thank you in advance for any help  encouragement  or for just reading about part of our story.,1100,5000,6,22,14,215,6
Help Baby Liam,https://www.gofundme.com/swmn9z-help-baby-liam,0,OCEANSIDE,CA,"Thank you for stopping by! My nephew  Liam Patrick Carney  aka \The Fighting Irish\"" was born far too soon at only 23 weeks. The medical bills have started rolling in and I've created this page to help relieve the financial burden my sister Stephanie and Zack are facing while their first born lays in Rady Children's Hospital  fighting for his life. Yesterday  Liam Patrick Carney turned 36 days old. As many of you know  he was born on September 1st at only 23 weeks. Liam was due December 26  2018 and decided to come a wee bit early. He's considered a micro-preemie and was not expected to survive. I've created this page because so many people have asked how they can help both Zack and Stephanie on the long road they have ahead of them.Unfortunately  the bills from various specialist  insurance and hospitals have started to arrive. This is the last thing Zack and Stephanie should be worried about.  Prior to Liam being born  Stephanie was working and in school completing her teaching credential  she's not returned to work and is faced with the stress of using her \""Family Leave Act\"" or saving it for a later date. After serving in the Marine Corps  Zack started using his GI Bill to earn a degree and is scheduled to graduate this December from SDSU. What many of you don't know is that shortly after finding out Steph was pregnant last May and sharing it with their families  Zack's father unexpectedly passed away on May 25th. Zack immediately went back home to Ohio for a month to be with his Mom and siblings. Only three months later his first child was born four months too soon. As you can imagine this has been a tragic six months for both Zack and Stephanie and they are truly each others support. Each day they drive 45 minutes south to Rady Children's Hospital to spend time with Liam who remains in the NICU. And each night they return home to get some rest and start all over again. Nobody prepares for this sort of thing and it's not one we save for either. In addition to the first insurance deductible  there is the added expense of traveling back and forth to the hospital each day. They also have to pay for parking in the structure next to the hospital. It would be an absolute blessing if finances were not an added stressor during this time. If you are able to donate anything  we would be grateful. And if you're unable we understand  but do ask that you keep them in prayer and please share this page with those you love. If you're able  please go to  https://www.facebook.com/LiamPatrickCarney/and like his page to stay up to date on Liam's progress.""",6000,14000,13,43,76,448,6

The fact is...Momma Rose is fighting and she is fighting HARD. Momma Rose has defined the doctors by overcoming obstacles with her treatment plans.  As a Nurse   I know how expensive medical bills and medicine (not covered by insurance) will get.  This does not include doctor visits  parking  hospital stays  ER trips and did I mention medicine for fighting 2 stage 4 cancers.  It's time for Momma Rose to take some help because we know she will not allow us if we asked! Cancer runs off certain things and one of them is STRESS.

On the way to the hospital  Isabella began to lose control of her limbs. While in the ER  Isabella stopped breathing  lost consciousness  and then had a seizure. And as she was being removed from the MRI machine  she had another seizure. Although numerous tests have been performed since Tuesday  the cause of her pains  seizures and loss of consciousness remains a mystery. As a result of all that transpired on Tuesday  Isabella has lost control of any muscle movement from the neck down and isn't able to breathe on her own. She is able to feel when touched and is coherent when spoken to  but the loss of motion and inability to breathe on her own are the reasons she remains in the ICU. With the permission and blessing of our aunt and uncle  Pacifica and  Paul Rooks  we have started this GoFundMe page to help their family with what looks to be a long road to recovery for Isabella.  Today is October 8th  day seven of this life altering event  and Isabella remains in the ICU.

Jason Tuckness,https://www.gofundme.com/jason-tuckness,7,HUNTINGTONBEACH,CA,October 13  2018Dear friends and family:A few weeks ago my 36 year old nephew  Jason Tuckness  was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis  which in scientific terms  is a respiratory disease that is characterized by airway obstruction caused by the accumulation of thick  purulent secretions  resulting in recurrent  symptomatic exacerbation's… In short  according to Jason’s physician he will need a double lung transplant within the next three to five years. It is my understanding that even if Jason is fortunate to receive 2 donor lungs  the surgery is successful  and his body doesn’t reject them  that perhaps his best scenario of life expectancy would be somewhere near the ten year mark. As you can imagine  our family was devastated to hear such news.Jason’s doctor has advised him to discontinue his commercial painting business immediately. As a result  Jason and I partnered in a delivery business that will allow him the opportunity to continue to support his family. I am proud of my nephew because he is not idly sitting around but wants to continue making a living for his family. Jason’s enthusiasm for this venture has me excited  and I am happy to be involved. Our motto comes from a former Navy Seal and motivational speaker by the name of  Richard John “Mack” Machowicz – “Not dead  can’t quit!” Jason knows he is in the battle of his life and has decided as long as he is breathing and has one heart beat left in him he is going to keep fighting because  in his words ” I want to get my children to adulthood.”Jason and Erin are great parents and have always put the needs of their children first. Jason has coached Pop Warner Football  Little League Baseball and has even been involved in Boy Scouts. However  what impressed me most is I recently learned he is involved in The Adventure Guides (formerly Indian Guides and Indian Princesses) program in Huntington Beach. Evidently it is a program developed by the YMCA to help strengthen family relationships. What?! Dads wanting to hang out with their daughters! Men after my own heart! Where do I sign-up? Seriousness  it is Jason’s hope that he gets to watch his two sons Jordan and Jason Jr. play many more football and baseball games along with having a number of daddy daughter dances with Mckenize. And maybe  just maybe  I’ll get to see him dance with his little girl at her wedding. That would be a special moment for everyone!Jason has a tough haul ahead of him! On Monday he has to have surgery to determine the extent of this terrible disease and hopefully rule out the possibility of cancerous cells. If all goes well  I have been told that he will be in ICU for three days and most likely be coming home in five.

It took nearly two years of aggressively working with doctors to identify and treat these illnesses to recover daily function and wellness  In that time and through the process those illnesses had affected her neurological  muscular  and digestive systems along with bone marrow  heart  and liver.This year Dionne began to feel extremely unwell again and tests have revealed her immune system is again severely compromised with systemic mold  toxicities  virus’ and infections in her blood.  Additionally  new testing is showing lymphoma tumor cells.  It is imperative that Dionne receives aggressive and specialized treatment for the many issues compromising her immune system in.  This has unique challenges as many of her organ systems are currently compromised.  She will require specialized treatments and the care of specifically trained and experienced specialists  most of which are not available locally nor covered by insurance.  Insurance did not cover many of the treatments from the previous two years illness  leaving the family financially taxed from paying for most treatments out of pocket. Dionne’s family is again looking at many financial needs not covered by insurance in the weeks and months to come  including: flight costs for both her and a family member to help with her care; housing/food while traveling; therapies  treatments  supplements and medications not covered beyond her limited insurance timeframe; and supplies and equipment prescribed for home therapies.Please consider being a part of blessing this family financially to help Dionne regain her health.,3000,10000,12,30,16,105,6

Migraine suffer looking for relief,https://www.gofundme.com/migraine-suffer-looking-for-relief,9,BATONROUGE,LA,I am writing to ask for donations for my nephew Jason Mason II who is suffering from migraine headaches.My nephew Jason is 27 year's old and was diagnosed in 2005 as having migraine headaches and his condition is progressively getting worse.  His neurologist Dr. Kahn at Ochsner Hospital informed our family that Jason's condition is highly complex  dangerous and almost incurable without specialty care for his form of migraine headaches.Jason has been dealing with this for 13 years as well as having been seen by numerous physicians in this field and no one could give  permanent relief. The physician's in Baton Rouge and New Orleans Louisiana informed the family there is nothing else they can do for him and referred his mother Beverly Mason to seek medical assistance from the Michigan Headache & Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor Michigan. His mother is presently in financial dismay due to having medical problems  as well as recovering from hardship due to flooding in the city of Baton Rouge in August 2016.The physician's at the Michigan Headache & Neurological Institute has extensive expertise in this filed of healthcare.I'm asking if you are able to assist by donating any amount to the gofundme account established on behalf of Jason Mason II. Jason is unable to work due to his medical condition. My family's economic situation is strained and we can't afford the out of state medical expenses which includes housing  travel and transportation in Ann Arbor up to but not limited to 4 weeks.

Help Nook&#x2019;s Survive Displacement,https://www.gofundme.com/NooksDC,7,WASHINGTON,DC,Nook’s Barbershop & Beauty Salon located in the Deanwood neighborhood of Washington  DC needs your help immediately to raise severely needed funds for an eventualy new location and move and infusion of funds for shop operation (utilities  supplies) due to an abrupt almost total loss of business.Please give as generously as possible and encourage others to do the same!Nook’s Barber & Beauty shop  opened by Wayne “Nook” Palmer has been a staple in Deanwood for generations  in fact Nook’s will be celebrating its 25 year anniversary this Spring. Nook (also a pastor at The House of Praise on Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue in NE) and his wife Sabrina ran the shop up until his passing in October of 2013. Sabrina now owns and runs the shop  committed to fulfilling the dream she and Nook had of passing the shop down to their children. Nook’s is a Black woman owned business that needs the community’s help to survive.Last October  the properties at the corner of Sheriff Rd/Eastern Ave NE were quietly sold to Neighborhood Development Company. The next day the tenants (business owners) were told they had to vacate the property due to an “environmental hazard” and padlocked the doors. The owners were trying to illegally evict them. Families were forced at the last minute to find emergency daycare services  and workers were unable to continue to make a living.In October Johnny Barnes  attorney for the business owners (Sabrina  two other Black women and two other non-Black people of color)  informed the community at a press conference that the new owners have provided absolutely no evidence for any of their claims or statements and “self-help” eviction is illegal in the District of Columbia and such actions must be done so legally in a court of law.Displacing long standing Black businesses in the name of building affordable housing is an intentional tactic used by developers and elected officials to pit Black folks against each other for the basic things we all need to survive.This is why we need your help! Nook's now suing the new owners and needs all the support they can get from the community. A lawsuit can take a long time to go through the courts  but it is going to take all of us to help the shop not just survive  but thrive during that time. Nook’s is still open for business every day.Initially Nook’s and its barbers were hemorrhaging customers and losing significant profit as people thought Nook’s had closed for good. In the months since  the customer base has remained lower  several barbers have moved on to other shops.The Ongoing Situation With MPDWhen communities are being gentrified (and developed) there is an all too common pattern of increased policing and in DC increased policing always results increased unconstitutional policing (stop and frisk)  increased use of force and  and increased police complaints. We’ve seen that play out on Sheriff Rd. This corner has seen its share of difficulty since this summer. Starting with illegal stop-and-frisks by Metropolitan Police Department’s violent Gun Recovery Unit (better known as Jumpouts) that escalated after MPD continued to taunt and harass the same young Black men in retaliation for the news and public pressure surrounding the initial incident.“It isn't lost on us that June 13th  the day the highly publicized illegal stop-and-frisk by MPD happened in front of Nook's  was also the day Mayor Bowser made her announcement of a $11.4M investment into redeveloping this corner (1100 Eastern Ave NE).” Said Anthony Lorenzo Green who is the ANC Commissioner for the block in a press release.Then  after the police incidents  curiously the air conditioning unit at Nook's Barbershop initially were vandalized  and then outright stolen. In the middle of the sweltering August weather  Black Lives Matter DC raised money and organized replacing the AC unit at Nook's Barbershop with help from the 411 Collective in finding a certified HVAC secured and installed the AC Unit. They also gathered volunteers to build a fence around the back of Nook’s which was painted by volunteers of the DC Antifacist Coalition. Afterword  a member of the 411 Collective designed and finished an incredible mural on the fence. Shortly after  Black Lives Matter DC  Stop Police Terror Project DC  and LinkUP held a clean up-day where volunteers cleaned and prepared for the Mutual Aid Pop-Up to help stir up more business as well as additional barbers and stylists.It’s up to us to come together and support our neighbors and help them survive the displacement they are facing. Thank you for stepping up to help!

But now he must focus his strength and energy in kicking cancers butt.  Those who know Rob know he has always controlled his destiny and he along with Victoria have worked very hard to build a beautiful life for their family. Yet cancer has disrupted their very foundations and brought about a heightened sense of uncertainty.  It is hard enough to battle an illness but when life’s daily stressors are added to it  some days it can seem impossible.  In order to give Rob a peace of mind  we  his family are coming together and asking all of you to join us to help Rob in his greatest fight yet.

Travel Expenses for visiting Bobby,https://www.gofundme.com/bobby039s-school-tuition,7,EDGEWOOD,NM,Our 10 year old son is autistic  (formerly known in the spectrum as Aspergers). Before his diagnosis  his preschool teacher advised us not to put him in public school because she recognized he needed more one on one time and increased structure. So  following her advice  we put him in a charter school. He was being punished for behaviors we now know are part of his autism and how his brain works. The result was frustrating and ended up in our decision to remove him from the school at the end of his first grade year. After three academically decent years in a local public school  the bullying became unbearable. We decided to put Bobby in a private school for students with special needs called Pathways Academy.  It has been a wonderful experience. The class sizes are small and bullying is non existent because everyone is going through similar things.  The price of this program is costly. We were unable to receive scholarship money due to unavailable funds through the school's scholarship program. We took a leap of faith and enrolled him anyway. We are asking for help with half of Bobby's tuition because I think we can do half from my income. My husband recently reinjured his shoulder and chest around the area he was shot last year and is dealing with severe pain. As such  his ability to continue hauling water as a way to supplement our income is limited. Please prayerfully consider helping us. Those of you who know Bobby know his heart and precious mind. We believe this is the school for him. Thank you. Shawn and Miriam Kirkbride,270,2500,7,11,7,90,6

Apryl found her on the floor of the house and got an ambulance up the mountain as quickly as possible. She spent about seven weeks in the hospital. She has such a long way to go.

The right side of her body is still paralyzed  and she has been trying to get her left hand to do what the right hand normally does.They unfortunately don't have any kind of insurance. While certain charitable organizations are being talked to see what they can do about medical expenses  there are other things that will need to be paid for on top of all that  like building a ramp to the door from their driveway  making the bathroom accessible  personal needs  and more. Candice comes home soon  and we need to make their little home accessible for her.Candice's care is going to be a 24/7 endeavor. Money received will largely go to covering her needs  as well as other bills and household expenses. $3 000 is the goal for now  but it all depends on how long it takes Candice to heal.These two women have lived a very spartan lifestyle  but their love for one another and the people and animals around them has always gotten them through  and now they need help.

As it turns out   I am in need of a heart valve repair/replacement.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital after I called 911. Unfortunately  the hospital did not have stroke and neurology units to appropriately provide emergent treatment to my husband’s condition.

We all thought she had caught it early  but as of last week we found out that she is now in stage 3 and will be starting chemotherapy next week. She has had to stop working and has applied for disability  but we aren’t positive that they will approve it. She will be going through 6 months of chemo  and we all know or have heard how expensive these treatments can be. Mary has always been such a hard worker and always full of energy  but since this disease has taken control of her body she has had a hard time because her energy level has dropped dramatically. She is the best mother-in-law anyone could ever ask for and has helped Jason and I out so much when we needed it  and she has always spoiled her grand babies rotten so I just want to do something for her because of everything she has done for us. If we could pay her medical bills for her we would  but it’s just too expensive. We just want her to be able to concentrate on fighting this fast growing disease instead of watching her stress about the nasty amount of medical bills she will be receiving. So we are asking for any help you can give  whether it be $5  $10 or more. Whatever you can contribute we will be so appreciative. Thank you all so much for your support!,7055,50000,11,14,33,230,6

Her symptoms include random fainting spells  which lead to multiple scrapes and bruising from the falls.  Because of these  she is unable to drive or work. Her heart rate races up to a newborns heart rate in the 150s at times.  She also suffers from low blood pressure  chest pain  anxiety  electrolyte imbalances  difficulty breathing  fatigue  insomnia  night sweats  spasms  forgetfulness and confusion just to name a few.  She has missed important life events of loved ones - weddings  graduations  birthday parties  first day of school  her son's sports games  and the list goes on.  The doctors have not been able to diagnose her and therefore there is no treatment - just symptom management. Tiffany has seen doctors from all specialties. Internal medicine  Endocrinology  Neurology  Nephrology  Physical Therapy  Chiropractic  Rheumatology  ENT  Cardiology  Pulmonology  Gastroenterology  Psychology and Psychiatry. She has been bumped around because no one can find the answers. Tiffany has an average of 1-2 medical appointments per week  and ends up in the ER about twice a month.  She has been admitted several times in the last year. She has had countless EKGs  Holter monitors and a linq devices  with no clear answer. My heart breaks for her when I see her suffering.  She is the most giving person  an amazing friend  a mother of 2 beautiful boys (9 and 3)  and a wife to a hardworking and loving husband. I created a gofund account to help her raise funds so that she can seek the opinion of an out of network physician who is a Board Certified  and focuses on integrative medicine. This physician has not only helped me  through my personal health issues dealing with cancer  but has also helped other friends with their chronic health issues.  The cost to see him can get quite expensive due to being out of network. Since Tiffany has not been able to work  the family relies solely on her husband's income  which makes it impossible for them to afford such out of pocket medical costs.  Thank you for taking the time to listen.,2600,3000,17,87,36,135,5
The Odyssey of FatDan&#x2019;s Funky Foot,https://www.gofundme.com/the-odyssey-of-fatdans-funky-foot,0,LANCASTER,CA,"May I present to you the story that I like to call  The Odyssey of FatDan’s Funky Foot.This story starts a little over 2 months ago (Aug. 6) when I felt some pain in my right foot and noticed that it was quite swollen. The fact that I was feeling pain was a bit alarming as I have quite severe nephropathy in my feet (as a result of diabetes). With that said I visited Urgent Care and was checked for DVT (blood clots in my leg) which came back negative and was thereafter advised to wear compression socks and follow up with regular doctor. About 6 days later (Aug. 12) while wearing earlier mentioned compression sock  as advised  I was walking a customer to the front of the retail store I work at and suddenly felt a rather dramatic “pop” in center of my foot. Pain was pretty intense and caused me to immediately start to limp. After a couple of hours of trying to continue to work and walk on it  the pain got to the point I felt I should leave and go get it checked out. My work has protocol for injuries while on duty so I had to have a manager call a third party medical evaluator and basically be triaged over the phone by a nurse practitioner. The phone nurse wanted me to take a look at my foot at which point I had to have assistance removing my shoe and the compression sock due to swelling. I advised the nurse that my foot was easily twice it’s normal size. The nurse then advised me to take a couple Tylenol  go on my break  elevate and ice my foot as she felt that it was just a sprain. I did as advised barely able to get shoe back on foot and with out my compression sock as there was no way I could stretch it enough to fit my foot. I finished out my shift and immediately went to urgent care. At this visit to the urgent care an x-ray was taken of my foot and the determination was I had some type of strain/ sprain. They gave a Cam Boot and advised to wear it whenever pain was bad. The next morning I could barely walk on my foot due to pain. So I called the “work nurse” again as I was not going to be able to attend work that day and was advised to see a workman’s comp. Dr. for further assessment. The workman’s comp. Dr. took x-rays and determined that I had “Plantar Fasciitis”  and that my injury was not considered an “industrial injury” as I was merely walking while at work when the injury occurred.I went back to urgent care on Aug. 17 to get my foot looked at again because swelling hadn’t gone down and was actually worse. Dr. came in looked at my foot briefly  touched the skin  and promptly diagnosed Cellulitis  prescribed antibiotics  and sent me home. On Sept. 10  yet another trip to urgent care results in another brief examination and diagnosis of Cellulitis with another course of antibiotics. Three days later (Sept. 13) I was finally able to see my regular Dr. who took another set of x-rays and advised I set an appointment with Podiatry which would be set for Sept. 18. I showed up for my appointment  registered at front desk  and sat waiting for two hours when finally I was helped and advised the front desk never registered me and would have to reschedule.Sept. 19  I go to work  just like I have been doing all this time  and after a couple hours into my shift I started getting really light headed and nauseous so I went back to personnel to let them know I was going to call someone to come pick me up and take me to urgent care. They gave me some water and had me sit for a while but after about an hour I felt no better so I left and drove to urgent care. At urgent care  in triage  my blood pressure was 70/40  my heart rate was 125 bpm  and I had a fever. The Dr. felt that it was the previously diagnosed cellulitis causing problems and had me transported to the ER via ambulance. I was then admitted to the hospital  given fluids and antibiotic by IV for 2 days and released with the diagnosis of Cellulitis.   I finally get to see the podiatrist on Sept. 25 and the Dr. advises me that I have been mis-diagnosed for the past month and a half and that the “pop” I felt on Aug. 12 was actually the Navicular bone in my footcollapsing completely leaving visible via x-ray only 2 small pieces. He also advised me that there was nothing that could be done to fix this and that it was the result of a condition called “Charcot Foot”. The Dr. then advised that if I continue to walk on the foot  more bones could collapse and could result in the amputation of my foot and or part of my leg. The Dr. then advised me that I am to stay off my foot as much as possible  I am to wear a diabetic cam boot whenever I need to take more than a handful of steps  and that I would be fitted for a C.R.O.W. Boot that I would have to wear for the rest of my life whenever I am to walk. What happens next scares the crap our of me  on Oct. 2  I go to urgent care because I am experiencing shortness of breath and I have a high heart rate. They do some blood work on me and promptly send me to the ER via ambulance with the suspicion of pulmonary embolism. At the ER it is confirmed  I have a clot in my pulmonary artery between my lungs and heart and they determined it had traveled from my bad leg and had formed due to all of the swelling I had been experiencing and then becoming sedentary due to the break in my foot.So here is the culmination of all of this information. I had to resign from my job because they couldn’t give me an open ended leave of absence as my podiatrist is unable to give an estimate as to when I might be able to walk normally again. I am in the process of trying to apply for disability (temporary or permanent depending on the outcome of my issue) and currently have no other income. This can also be the end of my culinary career path as if the worse should be the outcome I will not be able to continue with that path. I am starting this GoFundMe to help with some medical expenses as well as some life expenses until I can get back on my feet so to speak (if possible). I really hate to resort to relying on the kindness and generosity of my friends  family  and any other folks who may donate to my cause but I am at the point where I need to be a bit humble and ask for help. Any and all assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  Times like this reminds me of something my brother once said to me:\if you have faith as small as a mustard seed  you can say to this mountain  'Move from here to there ' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\"" – Mathew 17:20""",350,5000,8,7,6,59,6

Replace a Stolen Flute,https://www.gofundme.com/replace-a-stolen-flute,8,OXNARD,CA,Trevor Patrick Watkin is one of Chicago's finest musicians  and also one of Chicago's finest human beings.His flute skills are unparalleled  and he's one of the most beloved music teachers in the city.But recently Trevor’s flute was stolen.This is both professionally and personally devastating for him -- that was the flute he had as a young boy. There are literally 25 years of memories on that flute.He's one of the most generous people out there. He doesn't deserve this loss.Any musician understands how devastating losing an instrument can be. But you don't have to be a musician to  imagine — it’s his livelihood  and it’s a primary source of joy. Losing this means losing more than just a piece of metal.But an instrument is just that — an instrument — and Trevor can still teach and perform on a flute that’s new to him just as well as on a flute he’s had his whole life. So that’s what I hope to do with this campaign: replace his old flute (preferably with a professional grade flute fit for a lifelong musician and teacher).Like most of us  he makes enough to get by  and like most of us  he’s got a lot of debt  and he’s managing it  but he can’t really take on this kind of additional debt.That's where we come in—Trevor's friends  family  and anyone who cares about live music. And our friends and family. And our friends' and family's friends and family.Can you help him replace his flute?We're asking two easy things:1) Please donate what money you can.2) Please share this GoFundMe link with everyone you can – Facebook  Twitter  if you’ve got an email list...everywhere.If you know Trevor in real life  he’s got a birthday coming up...so instead of buying him a drink  a much better birthday present would to put that money into this GoFundMe  and then also share this link everywhere you can. These two things help tremendously.Please help get Trevor a new flute!,7075,7000,18,101,111,405,6

Fighting for Hope,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-james-white-family,0,DURHAM,NC,"Hello everyone. My name is Cynthia and I would like to tell you about my family  especially my husband Randy. (His name is James Randall   but most people call him Randy.) Almost 4 years ago Randy was a healthy  hardworking husband and father.  He is still a husband and father just not a healthy one.He went to work everyday to support his family. He never called out sick and was always dependable in whatever he did. Then he began to have swelling in his lower limbs and it got progressively worse. He continued to work until he could no longer do what his job required of him. He was a mainly a mechanic but he did all kinds of other jobs for the company he worked for. Randy has had numerous hospital stays over the past couple of years as his condition has worsened. His body cannot rid itself of fluids that continuously build up all over his body. (There are times when so much fluid has built up that it weeps out of his skin causing blisters. We have to keep them clean and dressed and apply bandages and antibiotic creams on his wounds and pads to keep the fluid from getting on things because we were told it is toxic. We have to wear gloves when handling anything.)  He is now unable to walk or do things on his own. He is on oxygen all the time because the fluid builds up around his heart and in his lungs making it difficult to breathe..(This has taken so much of a toll on his body that he looks much older than he is and people have actually thought he was my father.  (To that I proudly say \No  this is my husband.\"")We have been to numerous doctors and specialists for help and he is in constant pain but nothing has helped him and he continues to get worse each day. Sometimes I'm afraid to sleep at night  worried that he may stop breathing. Our son has given up a lot to stay home with his dad so that I can work. We can't afford to hire a caregiver so he  stepped in to help.     We have been told that a type of compression pump may help him but it is very expensive (anywhere from $8 000 to $10 000. ) We were told that this was probably not covered by insurance and they were right. We need help to pay for some of Randy's medical bills and to get the pump that he needs. We hope that no one else is suffering from this dibilitating medical issue and if you are our prayers are with you as we know first hand how devastating it can be.     My husband has told me so many times that he feels like a burden to us but he is not.  We have always tried to help others if we could and never thought we would be the ones needing help. But we do need  help. We are asking if anyone is willing to help us in any way it will be greatly appreciated from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you so much. Go to  www.gofundme.com/hope-for-randy-white-family""",1525,20000,12,8,12,77,6
Helping a sick dad,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-a-sick-dad,9,Calgary,AB,Jagnam had come to canada to visit his family but never thought that just days before his flight back home he would be hospitalized.

He has a loving wife and daughter who is just 3 years old and too young to even understand what is happening.He is suffering with an inflamed pancreas which was due to gallstones. He is on life support and dialysis because the inflamed pancreas is causing problems to other organs. The doctors are saying he will get better but his condition is so serious that it will be a very lengthy process and very expensive as well. we would appreciate any contribution you can give as we want him to make a full recovery without the daily stress of how he's going to pay the hospital bills at the end of all this.

The Cory McEachran Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/the-cory-mceachran-recovery-fund,0,Toronto,ON,For everyone who has questions  I thought it was time to answer what I can  as best as I can… I was walking and was hit by a vehicle (this much  I'm sure you already know). According to news reports  someone got out of the SUV that hit me  checked my pulse  and decided to leave the scene.  They were apprehended shortly after and the driver was caught driving under the influence.Shortly after  first responders found me unconscious  in a ditch  on the side of the road and in critical condition.  Medical staff cut my lungs and rammed tubes down them to help me breath. I was then transported to UPMC Presbyterian hospital in downtown Pittsburgh. Upon my arrival  I had nothing but underwear on  so  I remained a John Doe for two and a half days until finally being identified.  My mother was contacted by my bosses  as soon as they got word  and she flew to Pittsburgh immediately. For the next 4-5 days I don’t have any memory of being in the hospital  but I had my mother by my side to watch over me as the top medical staff tried to fix my ailments and keep me alive. They cut open my abdomen to sew up my intestines and colon three times. They stopped operating on me and couldn’t put a screw in my pelvis because i had become septic (the sepsis infection nearly took my life numerous times). Medical staff put a ventilator in my mouth to help me breath  but it took them three days to get it out again when it got stuck. High-five's all around  from the Docs  as they dislodged it; but as a result  I now have a raspy  whiskey voice that we’re currently looking at fixing.Due of my lungs  UPMC med staff recommended against ground transportation  so I was air-lifted to TBRHSC. I spent the next six days in Thunder Bay Regional hospital before getting transferred to St. Joes Hospital (for more rehabilitation). Now I lay in bed with a broken nose  neck  spine  ribs  pelvis  and two lower legs. I miss the shit out of my kids and cant wait until we are reunited; which  in itself  is incentive to get back on my feet.Thank-you all for your out-pouring of love and support  I can't wait to see you soon.-Cory,9560,10000,20,96,85,262,6

Michelle coded  and almost died  the second day in the hospital. Michelle was suspected to have been bitten by a spider and this caused extensive damage to her body. Her entire body was purple and she was mottling. She had to undergo emergency surgery to amputate her right leg due septic shock. Her kidneys shut down as a result of the infection. She was undergoing dialysis 3 times a week. Michelle survived after many different treatments  but her life is forever changed.Michelle is currently working toward recovery and has a long road ahead of her. She is in a skilled nursing facility  which is unable to meet her needs  but was the only choice she had due to insurance issues. Michelle has had to wait months to have any surgeries done as she had to be inpatient before insurance would pay for anything. Michelle had her port removed which caused a major infection throughout her body and in her bones and she had to go back to the hospital. Michelle was able to have her left thumb amputated  but the surgeon was unable to remove her index finger as it has been decaying so long it will need to fall off. Michelle is still battling the infection and dealing with the mental impact of this situation. Michelle has been unable to have rehab due to insurance issues. She can barely use her right hand  which still needs surgery to enable movement  she cannot walk  or care for herself.Michelle will need a prosthetic  physical and occupational therapy  nursing home funds  and many other things as she recovers. Michelle has essentially lost her way of life and will need a lot of support.Michelle is asking for help to make her recovery easier. Any donation given will be greatly appreciated and go towards Michelle's medical and living expenses.

He was brought to the hospital by a friend. As soon as they heard the news  Ian's children went to the Toronto general hospital to find their dad had cancer. Ian had just been diagnosed with colon cancer. It’s been a shock for him and his family of course. Since then  he has faced surgery twice. The recommended treatment after the recovery from the surgery is chemotherapy. Since these events  Ian hasn't worked and won’t be able to return to work. His current apartment is not an option anymore with its 32 stairs. That's why in the immediate  we are looking for a new apartment for him  more adapted for his recovery as soon as he'll be discharged from the hospital. Ian will also need home care services such as home-delivered meals and a visiting nurse. Funds will contribute to cover the expenses for the lack of income through these difficult times  to provide for incidental costs Ian may run into along the way and give him the dignity he deserves through his recovery.Your donations will give courage and hope to Ian and his family. If there are other ways you wish to help  please contact us.  We thank you in advance for sharing and donating as you're able!  Charlene for Ian and his children : Dylan  Travis and Dayna.__________________________________________________________________________Il y a quelques jours à peine  Ian Yee  le père de mon copain Dylan  a été retrouvé dans son appartement à Toronto  seul et pas très bien.

Ian venait de recevoir un diagnostic de cancer du côlon. Cela a été un choc pour lui et sa famille bien sûr.Depuis lors  il a été opéré deux fois.Le traitement recommandé après la guérison de l'opération est la chimiothérapie. Depuis ces événements  Ian ne travaille pas et ne pourra plus retourner au travail. Son appartement actuel n'est plus une option avec ses 32 marches. C’est pourquoi  dans l’immédiat  nous recherchons pour lui un nouvel appartement  plus adapté à son rétablissement  dès qu’il sortira de l’hôpital. Ian aura également besoin de services de soins à domicile  tels que des repas à domicile et une infirmière visiteuse.Les fonds contribueront à couvrir les dépenses liées au manque de revenus pendant ces temps difficiles  à couvrir les frais accessoires que Ian pourrait subir en cours de route et à lui donner la dignité qu’il mérite pour son rétablissement.Vos dons donneront courage et espoir à Ian et à sa famille.

Help Kai Recover,https://www.gofundme.com/5sh2f5-help-kai-recover,9,ELMONT,NY,On October 4th  2018  my life would forever change. During the evening  I noticed fames raging from my stove. I instinctively grabbed the burning pot and tried to prevent the fire from spreading. Unfortunately as I tried to extinguish the flames  hot oil spilled all along my body. Thankfully with the help of my neighbors and the brave EMT workers; I safely arrived at the Cornell Burn Center. Once admitted my burns were scrapped  cleaned and wrapped. Ive been told the severity of my wounds range from  2nd to 3rd degree burns. The latter requires skin graphing surgery and other treatments. Doctors aren’t sure how long treatment will last. As a result  I went on disability leave at my job. My disability benefits does not cover my stay at the hospital. I know my healing journey requires positivity  hard work and dedication. However  it can be hard to focus when I have financial stress lingering in my head. I am asking for donations to help alleviate the financial burden for both myself and my family. Thank you in advance for reading my story.Sincerely Kai Monroe,6540,5000,37,131,96,66,6

Dough for Dominic,https://www.gofundme.com/dough-for-dominic,1,MILLIS,MA,"Hi Everyone  This summer  just a few weeks before our kids would return to school  our friends  Fernando and Teresa Diaz  noticed a little bump on the side of their son Dominic’s neck. As any parents would do  they immediately brought him to the doctors. The doctors weren’t too alarmed  nor convinced that the little bump was anything serious  but they sent Dominic to have an ultrasound at Children’s Hospital just to be safe. The results were not what they were hoping to hear  as the doctors explained  \Mr. and Mrs. Diaz  your son Dominic has CANCER - Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\"" This news was devastating  for Dominic  Fernando  Teresa and their whole family. They have had to deal with numerous Doctor's appointments  trips to the hospital  an avalanche of information and the fear of the unknown. It has been an emotional roller coaster for them and very difficult for Fernando and Teresa to explain to their 13 year old son that he has Cancer. The next steps involved Dominic having a biopsy procedure  with the hope of being able to remove the lump. Unfortunately  the lump was too close to his artery and it could not be removed. So now  Dominic is receiving chemo therapy  which everyone is hoping will get rid of this awful cancer! Fortunately this type of cancer has a good prognosis - it IS treatable and curable. Dominic is scheduled to have another ultrasound to see if there are any changes and at that point  the doctors will decide if he needs radiation to further combat the cancer. In the meantime  Dominic has good days and bad days and has not been to school very much. Fernando and Teresa are amazing and are doing everything they can to keep him positive and to help him feel as normal as possible through this situation. Dominic has started to lose his hair and is  understandably  feeling a bit self-conscience. The most important thing for Dominic right now is to get physically healthy and just as important  to stay emotionally healthy. It is very easy to become depressed and feel alone when diagnosed with cancer. So we ask that friends continue with texting  calling  sending notes/cards and asking Dominic to hangout and keep including him in activities (as long as he is feeling well). All of this support will help him get thru this! We have set up this GoFundMe page as a way to help the Diaz family and are asking for your support for such a caring and loving family. The medical expenses can be costly and by contributing to this  we are not only helping Dominic in his fight  but we are coming together as a community to show that we care and want to help the family with this unasked for burden. Please contribute what you can and help spread the word by using social media outlets like Facebook  Instagram  Twitter. Together  we can all make a difference. We'll be updating this page from time to time as the Diaz family and the Millis community fights on behalf of Dominic. Thanks for your consideration and support.Sincerely Lauren Gavigan and Donna Walsh""",5605,10000,21,56,92,264,6
Ellen&apos;s Home Burned and They&apos;ve Lost Everything,https://www.gofundme.com/ellen039s-struggle-to-survive,2,NEWARK,DE,Last Friday our daughter’s home caught fire and was destroyed—the structure along with all of their belongings. Everything. They’ve also lost their two beloved dogs who were inside when the fire started. Fortunately my daughter’s family was not at home at the time the fire started.Many of you know that Ellen (our daughter  has suffered from serious cancer andsubsequent surgeries  chemo  and radiation during the past year. This is simply devastating. They had very little before the fire and now they have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Even her expensive medications were destroyed  along with the wigs and hats she’d purchased after chemo caused her to lose her hair. And  the signed books  her cherished Kindle  and other gifts sent to her by each of you during her cancer treatments … are gone.Their son Tyler’s wrestling and martial arts medals (he's a state champion)  trophies  and awards are gone. His clothing and shoes  gone. TV’s and computers and tablets and X-boxes and games  gone. His wrestling gear and other prized possessions are no more.Ellen’s husband’s clothing and work shoes are small mounds of charred ash.Their fish tank and fish. Appliances … melted. In fact  the fire was so hot it melted the siding on their neighbor’s home  and it’s not very close.But the biggest loss of all  to them  was the loss of their four-legged babies  their cherished dogs. Tyler tried to enter the fully-engulfed home to rescue the dogs but was tackled and pulled away by firefighters who  by the way  did go inside to complete the rescue. They performed CPR on both dogs but were unable to revive them.So kind thoughts  well-wishes  and prayers  if you’re so inclined to do so  are muchappreciated.Please  if you can. They need you! No amount is too small. From earlier ...Our daughter  Ellen Proffitt  my little girl  has been battling serious cancer for the past year. During this ongoing fight for her life  all while enduring intense pain and sickness  medical bills totaling thousands upon thousands of dollars have depleted all her family's meager resources  and more bills arrive almost daily. Then Hurricane Florence hit and Ellen and her family were forced to evacuate. Their community was hit hard and many areas there are still underwater.  Ellen's teenage son's high school is still closed and undergoing reconstruction approximately four weeks later  due to a hard blow from the powerful storm.Ellen's home  experienced damage from the winds and water and  as a result  they lost what little food they had as well as the loss of major appliances - refrigerator  clothes dryer  etc.  Due to the exposure to water  mold has now formed on interior walls  which is extremely dangerous to those who've received chemo and radiation. Their septic system has now failed.Ellen's financial and medical situation is dire. The stress of dealing with cancer is devastating  as you know  but add to it the worry over losing a home and your belongings  well  it's more than most people could and should have to endure in a lifetime  yet Ellen faces this daily. They're forced to use a cooler and ice for short-term food storage and their temporary bathroom is a rented port-a-john situated at the end of their driveway.Immediate assistance is needed; therefore  if you could help in any way with any amount  the family would be deeply grateful. We wouldn't ask  but the need has reached the point of being overwhelming.Thank you in advance for your donations  well-wishes  kind thoughts  and prayers.,12980,100000,20,13,144,462,6
Katelin Jane&apos;s Never Ending Battle,https://www.gofundme.com/katelin-jane039s-never-ending-battle,0,Toukley,NSW,Hi My name is Jess Thompson. I am Katelins big sister. I am raising this Money to help my Beautiful Sister and Mum while Katelin fights yet another Battle in her young 22yrs of life. Katelin has Cystic Fibrosis  at the age of 20yrs old Katey had to undergo a Double lung transplant or she would have died. This was back in Jan 2017. Over the past Year and a half katey has had her hurdles but has always graced them with a smile and done what she had to do. :)She became well enough that for the first time in her life she was able to live like a 'normal' person and get a job  go to tafe and start dancing (Which she has loved all her life). Everything was going great post transplant until about a month ago when Katey got a Chest Infection. This Chest Infection took a great toll on Kateys body and because of this her body started to Reject the new lungs. The Drs are confidnet that they can reverse the rejection this time round so that Katey can go on to live a wonderful life again and fulfill her dreams.But in order to get to this stage she must first endure 5 rounds of transfusion called Plasmopherisis. Followed by an Immunogloblin transfusion. This will filter her blood allowing the Drs to remove all the bad blood attacking her new lungs and replace it with clean blood that doesn't recognise the lungs. This is a draining and daunting experience alone. However katey is also on Iv antibiotics to help her chest infection and she has also developed a clot in the main artery in her leg so is also on IV blood thinners. To top it all off for her Katelin has only had 2 rounds of the Immunogloblin and both times has crashed dangerously due to  a reaction created from the Immunogloblin. This has resulted in Katey being transferred to the ICU ward until she is completely finished treatment. Katey is scared and exhausted but not once has she given up. Our beautiful amazing and strong Mum has not left her bedside and won't until Katey can leave with her. They live over an hr away from the hospital which is taking a toll on them financially with parking costs  fuel costs meal costs and the list goes on. Because of this they have had to dip into a Special Savings Account. This account is what has been saved up by my mum and Katelin to help Katelin to fulfill her dreams which were her Bucket list pre Transplant. One of Katey's dreams is to have a White Christmas in New York and to see the ball drop in Times Square on New Years Eve. Flights and Accommodation have already been booked for Katelin to go to New York this Christmas to check of this particular goal. :) The Drs have full confidence that they will be able to get her well enough to still go as scheduled. However Katey won't be able to do all the things she wanted to do on her trip now as they have already had to start using some of the savings and Katelin will also be unable to work for quite some time again while she mends. My mum is also unable to work as she won't leave Katey's side. They are scheduled to Fly out at the beginning of Dec. Katey is expected to be in hospital for a min of 3 more weeks which will only leave a few weeks between getting home and flying out and no time to save anymore spending money to make this the most magical experience ever for her.Please help me help my Mum and Sister financially so that they can get through these next few weeks with ease and so Katey can get her White Christmas with all the Bells and Whistles like she deserves.

Please please help.**UPDATE** They have allowed her the opportunity to get the surgery; however  she is in desperate need of assistance to help pay for the growing medical bills. ALL DONATIONS HELP TREMENDOUSLY!——————This fund is for my husband’s aunt who is in immediate need of surgery to continue on with her life. One free of the incessant turmoil she has dealt with now for far too long. She has to secure a minimum of $5 000 by October 17  2018 to be able to schedule the surgery required to fix an invasive procedure done over two decades ago. She’s been fighting to simply keep food down the past 6 months and in that time was even forced into a liquid based diet; however at this point liquids are hardly an option. She’s losing an average of 2 pounds a day and without the emergent gastric bypass surgery needed chances of life in itself for her are unknown.Please help us raise the funds needed! I have attached her handwritten story below: In December of 1998 I had a Vertical Banded Gastroplasty surgery done. This surgery back then was very invasive and not very common for weight loss. It involved dividing my stomach off at the esophagus. I was 350lbs then. I lost 150 the first year and was able to get pregnant with my son  which I was told I could not. Over the years I've had several complications but nothing that couldn't be resolved. Until now. 3 years ago i ended up in the hospital vomiting blood and unable to keep anything down. They told me that i had developed ulcers around the bottom of my esophagus and would eventually close up the hole that was created with the VBG surgery. The surgery is not reversible and the materials used are not removable. 6 months ago I started vomiting again and I went to the dr who I've seen for more than 30 years so was very knowledgeable of me  my medical history and he immediately referred me to a gastroenterologist. They did an Endoscopy and found that the hole is completely closed. Because of the excessive vomiting  at least 5 times a day  more ulcers have developed in my esophagus. He referred me to another gastroenterologist who he felt had better equipment and could possibly dilate the hole where the band is located. Another Endoscopy was scheduled that same week. This dr was also unable to get the scope through the hole because it was closed. He was also unable to dilate the hole because of the material of the band. He immediately referred me to a bariatric surgeon. During this time I am still vomiting everything. Unable to keep anything down. Once or twice a week in the ER  dr office or hospital stays  because of severe dehydration  kidney function at 25%  malnourished. Aspirating in my sleep  which caused food particles to end up in my lungs. I was sent to have a bronchoscopy which they were able to wash some of the particles. My muscles cramping up in my legs  arms  feet and hands. I see the surgeon who tells me the only way to fix it is a full blown gastric bypass. He is explaining in detail what has happened and that it is life threatening. Surgery was scheduled but of course we have to wait on insurance approval. I was not worried much about it. It was life threatening and I have already maxed out all of my portion of copays and coinsurance. Insurance came back with an approval within a couple of days. But come to find out my employer had written into the policy that any bariatric procedure would be separate from my regular policy and none of the money I've paid would go towards any copays or deductibles. I was devastated to learn I had a $5000 deductible that has to be paid by the 17th of this month and unknown medical bills that will precede the surgery. I feel like my only option at this point is to cancel surgery and try to live as long as I can like this. Just since June i have lost 45 lbs from not being able to eat. I'm averaging a weight loss now of about a pound every 2 days. I'm sick all day every day. Most days i can barely walk from my muscles cramping up  being extremely week. I require assistance with almost everything I do. Being a single mom and barely making it month to month anyway  this has put a very big financial burden on me. The medical Bill's are staggering and I'm getting further and further behind on everything. The excessive time off work because I'm sick  hospital stays  dr visits  the numerous tests  medications etc. Is causing a strain on work  home and relationships. This surgeon is the best and the surgery is in excess of $40 000  but the price is nothing compared to being able to save my life. I'm only 49 years old. I'm not ready to die.,2180,8000,5,27,29,506,6

Help Priest Recover From Stroke,https://www.gofundme.com/help-priest-recover-from-stroke,9,JORDANVILLE,NY,My father  protopresbyter John (Ioann)  is 63 years old. He has served for many decades in a small Russian town called Vyshny Volochyok. He always walked by foot to the church (a few kilometers a day) from the church house where he lived with my mother  Matushka Tatyana.On August 12th  ignoring the strange weakness in his limbs  he continued serving church services. Only two days later  he was hospitalized with stroke symptoms. The doctors diagnosed him with a stroke in the left side of the brain  which lead to the paralysis of the right side of his body. Unfortunately  the medical care in our hometown hospital turned is deplorable. The hospital lacked an MRI machine  and much time was lost both on diagnosis and any kind of treatment.On the 21st  we finally managed to transfer Fr. John to a hospital in Moscow. After three weeks of basic first aid  doctors finally performed a full medical examination and established a course of treatment. Due to his weak state and thrombosis of his right leg  rehabilitation has been delayed. For now  Fr. John is receiving constant treatment at home. He requires 24-hour care from a professional nurse  periodic house calls from doctors and continuous expensive medical services and medicines.Since the stroke  more than 350 000 rubles (about $ 5 500) has been spent on his medical needs. Now we need a professional consultation with doctors and specialists for further rehabilitation. On average  medical services in Russia cost 5 000 rubles (about $ 80) per session. According to the doctors  the crucial  thing now is not to miss the time and prescribe the correct treatment. Otherwise  Archpriest John could remain bedridden forever. Will you please help us help him?  Your prayers and monetary donations will be greatly appreciated by all who love Fr John and by those whose lives have been touched by him.God Bless!Ivan,3636,5000,29,73,35,55,6

Terry has been very sick lately. Back in the summer  he took part at a lifestyle session at Uchee Pines Lifestyle Center  and he also had a lot of testing done. What the doctors first thought was cancer turned out to be enlarged gastric folds  ulceration of stomach and  chronic gastritis  which resulted from h-pylori. He couldn't eat. He looks like a malnourished person from some famine-wracked country.Vilma  Terry's wife  has him on a special treatment plan . He is getting a little better  but still weighs only 125 lbs. He is very weak and unable to concentrate on anything. It's going to take at least six months for recovery by the grace of God.  Terry hasn't been able to work at their outpost for the last six months.  Winter is on its way and there are many things that must be accomplished  for them to do to get ready for the winter  not to mention everyday things that has been left undone. They  covet your  prayers  but they also need financial help to hire someone help them get ready to survive the winter.  These two have lived their lives in service to others.  It's time for others to reach back and give them a hand.  Please help all you can.Blessings Daniela Weichhold and Helene Thomas,3800,10000,21,38,21,59,6
Joel Santos Hodgkin&#x2019;s Lymphoma,https://www.gofundme.com/joel-santos-hodgkins-lymphoma,0,HUDSON,FL,Hello everyone! My name is Karianne Amerose and I am the fiancée to Joel Santos Gonzalez. In July 2017  Joel was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and was started immediately on ABVD chemotherapy. After 6 months of ABVD with a lot of progress  his PET scans showed that about half of his original tumors still remained persistent. The doctors decided to put him on an immunotherapy called Brentuximab Vedotin. After 3 months on that medication  the doctors found it to be ineffective and Joel’s cancer grew and spread. The doctors then switched him to another immunotherapy called Keytruda. This medication drastically helped Joel and his most recent PET scan on October 8th  2018 showed his remaining disease had decreased by 75%. Unfortunately  Joel is still not in remission and although his tumors are much smaller than they were originally  he still has active cancer in his body. The next step is a stem cell transplant in November 2018. He will be in the hospital for approximately 3 weeks. He will be then be staying at the Hope Lodge (designated rooms specifically for cancer patients  next door to Moffitt Cancer Center) for approximately 8 weeks. He will then finally be home where he will be severely limited in regards to what he’s allowed to do for the next couple of months as he will have an extremely low immune system. We are so grateful for the help we have received so far. Joel has two children  Anabel 5 and Julian 8. They are his pride and joy. We are just asking for a little help to cover his medical bills and transplant related expenses. Thank you for your time!!P.S.  Joel asked me to include the following message as he doesn’t have social media accounts and sometimes finds it hard to reach people:I want to deeply thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for all of the donations thus far. Although this time has been difficult  I’ve been truly moved by the compassion and generosity you all have shown me. I’ve been trying hard to get back to everyone who has donated or helped me in any way and I apologize if I haven’t gotten to you yet. Know that I’ve read every single message and that you all helped me immensely. To those that gave to my previous fundraiser  thank you so much! The site is no longer active so if you tried to go there and didn’t see it  that’s why. You guys helped me pay for all of my medical bills in 2017! I can’t thank God enough for such a wonderful community of family  friends  students (present and former) and people I don’t personally know who happen to feel moved to help out. Lord knows you’re all amazing and I truly hope you’re all doing well. This fund is intended to help pay for my treatment in 2018 (I still have bills I need to pay) and for 2019 (every year my insurance resets and begins charging new bills until I’ve maxed out). May God bless you all. If you want to get in touch with me  send Karianne a message and she’ll give you my number and/or email. Thanks Joel Santos Gonzalez,4015,5000,8,80,46,445,6

Robert Parkes Cancer Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/robert-parkes-cancer-journey,1,NewTecumseth,ON,3 months ago our lives changed.  Bob's kidney was failing and it was removed on August 7  2018.  2 weeks later we were told that he had an aggressive form of cancer.  He had his first chemo treatment on October 4 and the side effects were severe.  He will be undergoing these treatments until Christmas.  He is now unable to work until most likely the new year and has already missed over 2 months.  As his wife I am also missing numerous days from work to be by his side during the treatments and aftercare.  Our hope is that this platform will enable us to remain in our home during his treatments and recovery and help lessen the stress of the financial burden that was unexpected.  Thank you everyone for your support and prayers they mean the world to both of us.,1405,5000,6,28,18,263,6

Hurricane Can&#x2019;t Stop Hope For Hanna,https://www.gofundme.com/hurricane-cant-stop-hope-for-hanna,2,LUMBERTON,NC,This is 9-year-old Hanna. Between fighting cancer for the last 7 years  and having her home in Lumberton  N.C. flooded twice in 2 years  she could really use some help. At the age of two  Hanna was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma -- a very aggressive and hard to treat form of childhood cancer. She has been through multiple rounds of chemo  radiation  clinical trials  and surgical procedures to try to destroy the tumor in her head. Unfortunately  she has also endured multiple relapses.Childhood cancer alone puts a huge financial burden on any family  but Hanna's family has endured even more. In addition to their battle to save Hanna  her family has suffered the devastation of flooding in their home two times in the last 2 years. Hanna’s house first flooded during Hurricane Matthew. Her family was displaced for a year while her house was made safe for her to live in again. Hanna had just returned to her home only three weeks before Hurricane Florence flooded her house again. And once again her family is displaced  dealing with lost possessions and overwhelming repairs -- all while STILL battling Hanna’s cancer.Hanna will be undergoing aggressive  life-altering surgery to try to remove her cancer in the next few months. Because she is immunocompromised  Hanna cannot return to her house until it is 100% free from mold. Hanna would love to be back in her home for her recovery and would be so grateful if you could help her family achieve this goal. All of the money raised from this campaign goes directly to Hanna’s mom  Melissa. A donation in any amount helps so please consider contributing  if you are able. If you know of any resources or belong to any groups who might be able to assist with their recovery efforts  please share that info. Hanna’s family did not have flood insurance and they have a long road ahead of them. Please share this campaign and please keep Hanna and her family in your thoughts and prayers.Transparency regarding this campaign - my name is Amy Hermann. I am the leader of the Wilmington Childhood Cancer Support Group in Wilmington NC. I am a fellow cancer mom. I became friends with Hanna and Melissa several years ago at the pediatric oncology clinic at UNC in Chapel Hill. All money raised will go directly to Melissa to help rebuild her home and to help care for Hanna.,6690,15000,10,45,55,466,6

Banner&#x2019;s  life with ROHHAD,https://www.gofundme.com/banner-life-with-rohhad,0,WAKEFIELD,RI,"Hello world  my name is banner  yes like the HULK. I’m 3 years old and I like to play  and spend time with my mommy and daddy. This past year my time with my parents have been hard and I’m asking for help from you so I can get better and my mom and dad can stop crying sad tears. They love me so much  as my daddy says “IM THE BEST LITTLE GUY IN THE WORLD”.I suffer from a condition called ROHHAD. ROHHAD is an acronym for rapid-onset obesity (RO) with hypothalamic dysregulation (H)  hypoventilation (H)  and autonomic dysregulation (AD). It is a rare  life-threatening syndrome that affects the autonomic nervous system (which controls involuntary actions like breathing and your heartbeat) and the endocrine system. As the name suggests  the key features include dramatic weight gain over a six- to 12-month period in the first 10 years of life  followed by hypothalamic dysfunction  dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system  and alveolar hypoventilation. Children with ROHHAD appear to have normal growth  development  and general health prior to onset of symptoms. The cause of ROHHAD is currently unknown. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. My mommy and daddy love me more than anything in this world. They give me everything they possibly can at any moment but my family needs your help in this moment. By donating you will be giving me a chance to grow  a chance at a good and loving life and a chance at a future. Please donate. Anything you can give is helpful.         Banner on his 3rd birthday in February   Started quickly to gain weight with no reason. We had been dieting and cutting all sugar carbs  gluten free... nothing was changing. In fact he kept gaining. We booked with an endocrinologist (who we ended up not liking) who told us to \keep dieting and I will see you for a follow up in 2 months.\"" so We got a referral to Hasbro endocrinology instead.  They immediately saw a problem and ordered a slew of tests. Rohhad was not discussed at this time but in the notes from Dr to Dr We saw that it was on the table. So His mother got more info from Dr Google  (bad idea) and from then on We have been  praying the MRI would come up with something. An operable sist  or tumor  just something... an answer. Banners mother woke up a Tues morning this September and thought Banner was talking in his sleep  She didnt know why She went in  but when She did he was gasping for air. She turned the lights on and he was blue and limp and unresponsive. We called 911 and spent 15 days in ICU. 8 days intubated. From a common cold. That's what caused him to not breathe. His fever was 106 ..so they believe he also had a seizure. We are home and sleeping with a bipap. For now  this is our new normal... Banners weight has plateaued and we are keeping it together. We all feel lucky. He wakes up every morning smiling and runs and plays and that makes me feel lucky. What we are most sad about is what’s in our future  We hold onto the fact that he doesn't feel \""sick\"" and we thank God for small favors. The boy who saved us  and put back together Our hearts  that was so broken I didn't think I would ever love again... #BANNERSTRONG    All  donations will go to medical needs for Banner from now and In to the future. Thank you all so very much for your time reading about this  disease  ROHHAD and a little into  our  Life’s with Banner.""",7845,50000,11,16,143,1000,6

Help Ronda Keep her Body Working,https://www.gofundme.com/help-ronda-keep-her-body-working,6,FORTWORTH,TX,I desperately need help! I feel horrible for doing this  but sometimes your body decides it doesn’t want to work any more  and you need help. I’m swallowing my pride and informing the world of my drama.In an effort to keep this is short as possible  here it goes:  (jump to the last 2 paragraphs if you want to skip the crazy details and get to the point)I have lost almost all muscle in my right hand  and the left hand has started wasting as well. I went to the Dr and was originally diagnosed with tennis elbow  but things didn’t quite add up so I was ordered to get a C Spine MRI where multiples cysts were found on nerve roots  and numerous lesions on my spinal cord. I was sent to a neurologist with a clinical diagnosis of either MS or ALS. ALS was quickly ruled out. More MRIs were requested to the tune of $2 000. I ended up only getting one of the 3 MRIs  the brain  because who can afford that?! They found lesions furthering the MS suspicion  as well as a Pineal gland cyst which is causing my weird headaches and issues with sleep. An EMG and NCS of my arms found that I have ulnar neuropathy in both arms. The right nerve is actually hardening now and will require surgery. The left arm I’m not sure of yet. I just scheduled an appt with the orthopedic surgeon and will find out more Oct 18. Now back to the MS...I  have to have the other 2 MRIs and a lumbar puncture to seal the deal  and for the insurance company to cover the meds. I already have bills coming in that I can’t cover  and a lot more to go.$250 up front every Neuro appt  $800 for the EMG and NCS of which I’ve paid $400  $400 for first MRI  $750 for the second  $1 300 for the remaining two needed MRIs  and who knows what for the Orthopedic surgeon plus cost of surgery. I have a $3 000 deductible and $5500 max out of pocket of which I have  paid $1 500 of so far. I appreciate and love everyone of you regardless of your willingness or ability to help me. Please never forget this!,2610,4500,10,58,38,322,6

As a result of the cruel disease  she suffers now from severe osteoporosis which started off as 2 fractured vertebrae  to now 7. Drs. Have had trouble with pain control and it seems that the next problem waits in the dark. Doctors eventually removed the tumor found that the adrenal gland was in good shape so we thought no more surgeries.. until we discovered cortisol numbers were still going up.. long story short ..what we found out was she then had a double kidney infection. Which was \something they've never seen b4. While in the hospital  she is unable to work obviously and never ever thought she'd be out of work for SOOOOOO long . Her pride is so big and would never ask for help. We are all doing what we can and appreciate if u could help with even one dollar.

A Baby for Elijah and Kia- IVF,https://www.gofundme.com/a-baby-for-kia-and-elijah-ivf,8,LAFAYETTE,LA,First off  we want to thank you for showing interest in Elijah and Kia’s infertility journey. They are very dear friends of ours and we felt compelled to share their story in hopes of lifting the financial burden they’ve been carrying in trying to start their family. Elijah and Kia have been married for 5 years and always knew they wanted children but after years of trying to conceive on their own  Kia was diagnosed with Stage 3 Endometriosis in 2015.  She underwent surgery to remove most of the endometriosis at the beginnjng of 2016 and afterwards felt very optimistic about conceiving naturally.  Unfortunately  that hasn’t been the case. If you know anything about endometriosis  you know there is no cure. It will continue to grow causing debilitating pain every month. The more it grows  the more damage it can cause to reproductive organs so time is of the essence. Pregnancy  however  causes the endometriosis to stop growing temporarily. They were referred to a fertility specialist here in Lafayette and have already undergone 3 failed IUI procedures and have spent thousands of dollars thus far.  They have done everything in their control to conceive. Invitro-fertilization or IVF is the next  last step. Sadly health insurance will not cover ANY fertility treatments whatsoever and it’s very costly.It’s truly been heartbreaking for us to walk alongside of them. I know it has been a difficult journey so far  but they have remained stead fast and hopeful for their miracle baby. We strongly believe our God is a miracle working God whether that’s Elijah and Kia conceiving on their own (we are still believing!) or through the process of IVF.In Paul’s letter to the Galatians  He reminds them: “The whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (5:14) How is that love best manifest? “Bear one another’s burdens  and so fulfill the law of Christ” (6:2) Friends  let’s help them carry this heavy burden by covering the cost of just one round of IVF. We know they’re going to be amazing parents one day!We thank you again for hearing our hearts and please keep Elijah and Kia in your thoughts and prayers!,1995,22150,11,9,17,123,6

Sandy&apos;s financial support,https://www.gofundme.com/sandy039s-financial-support,6,SAUKCITY,WI,Sandra Lynn Maier  age 57  was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1998 when she was 38. The news was devastating. Her right leg was one of the areas affected by the MS symptoms. Once an avid runner as part of her exercise regime  she struggled to continue. Eventually she had to give up running. With the aid of a walker she would do aerobic exercise daily  and did this religiously until that also became too difficult to do. The MS caused problems with her right hip and she would need surgery and hip replacement. Despite this setback  she never gave up with doing some kind of exercise. At least two or three times per week you could find her exercising while watching videos of disabled people doing a variety of exercises.Eventually she would be resigned to living life in a wheel chair. Still  she would find videos of people exercising in wheel chairs. There you would find her  in front of the tv  exercising for up to an hour a day.In 2014 the Wisconsin MS Foundation bought Sandra a recumbent tricycle. This bike gave her the freedom and independence she missed. She took advantage of by riding her bike everyday  even riding it during the winter when practical. She participated in Bike MS: TOYOTA Best Dam Bike Ride in 2015-16-17. Shortly after starting the ride in 2017 she had to stop as a result of still another physical problem. Her hip replacement had caused nerve damage in her affected leg. The muscles on the inner side of her leg were stronger than the muscles on the outer side. The result  those inner muscles would pull  or twist her food in and up. Different medical ideas were used to correct the problem. At first a series of exercises were used and then an expensive brace was created. Botox treatments. Nothing worked. Worst of all she could no longer ride her bike. Her foot being so twisted could not pedal the bike.All she wanted to do was have the ability to walk again  but now she was also unable to ride her bike  or even doing something as simple as getting in and out or bed. After meeting with doctors and staff of UW Hospital  Madison  WI a decision was made to amputate her leg below the knee and fit her with a prosthetic.Her surgery is scheduled for October 11th this year at UW Hospital  Madison  WI. She will be off work for at least six weeks. Insurance should cover the medical costs  and she will receive benefits from Aflac but there will be other expenses not covered.,1775,10000,10,18,7,54,6
Nova&apos;s  Heart Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/nova039s-heart-fund,9,YOUNGSVILLE,PA,On August 30  2018  four year old Nova Swab went to her PCP for a routine head start physical. The doctor thought she heard a small murmur and said that it should be checked... Nova went to a pediatric cardiologist in Erie  PA the following week. The pediatric cardiologist found a large hole in Nova's heart. The hole is referred to as ASD (Atrial Septal Defect). It is a hole located on the dividing wall between the top two chambers of her heart. The hole measures 1.2 cm. The hole is causing already oxygenated blood to leak into the right atrial chamber of the heart causing a large amount of swelling to the right chamber of her heart and sending over-oxygenated blood back into her blood stream putting her at risk for more imminent health issues such as a stroke. The cardiologist suggested that she be seen at the Pittsburgh Children's Hospital to discuss options to close the hole.  On October 4  2018 Nova was seen at PCH and underwent 2 more echo-cardiograms where a second hole was discovered measuring 5mm. Due to the second hole a catheter device was no longer an option and the family was told that Nova would have to undergo open heart surgery where they would have to crack her sternum  place her on bypass  perform the surgery  and then restart her heart and begin recovery. Nova does have medical insurance and the procedure itself will be covered by her insurance. However  the family will need help with medical supplies  a hotel for the family to stay while Nova is at the hospital recovering  fuel to get back and forth for the surgery and follow up exams  and her mother will have to take unpaid FMLA to take care of Nova at home while recovering. Please help little Nova and her family!,1615,5000,7,32,48,561,6

"Lupus, kidney failure fight",https://www.gofundme.com/zm7ba-sick,0,MOUNTDORA,FL,As most of you know my mom Tonya Durden is a 43 yr old who has been diagnosed in 2015 with SLE Lupus. The first year we dealt with her getting what we thought was pneumonia several times a year. In 2016 she started to get worse and sick more often  longer hospital stays  and her lungs started to have more troubles. In 2017 her lupus turned severe and not really knowing much about lupus we weren't sure what was going  on with the disease turned debilitating. This has landed her in ICU several times and fighting for her life on life support. Her lungs are so painful in these times the doctors explained it as if she had 30 to 40% burns in her lungs without placing her on life support even with all the pain medications she would not be able to handle it. She stays weeks at a time and when shes finally able to come home she has to learn to walk and build enough strength to lift her arms to feed herself. Because she has no insurance she can not go to physical therapy for help. It has been a very hard road for her and not sure what is in store for her future. Since she has got so sick she has lost her job there for she has lost her insurance. She has looked into other insurance and the cost is so high she can not afford it.  In Feb of 2018 she was placed on life support again this time even worse she was on it for 10 days and the 11th day they consulted our family and stated they needed to place a trach in her and send her to a facility that could take full time care of her  we explained she wouldn't like that but understood  so the doctor tried one more time to take her off the ventilator to see if she could breath on her own without to much pain she did it she fought with all her might to keep breathing with little help! Tonya is a fighter and always has been we thank God everyday that she is a fighter and she is still here. Tonya needs to see several specialist and without ins or large amounts of money she can not go to those doctors. we have tried everything we know of to get help medicaid turns her down every time and she has been fighting social security disability for 3 years and they continue to turn her down. we are out of options. She needs the correct medications and the ones she has now are approximately $300 a month. She relies on her family for her medications soon they will not have enough to buy anything more.Tonyas medial bills are racking up fast and she is unable to pay anything. Getting her to the correct doctors and the correct medications we are hoping she may be able to go into remission where she will still have to be careful being she is always going to be immune compromised At this time Tonyas lungs are severely damaged and trying to figure out the exact lung disease that causes her lungs to just stop with no warning  she has had her gall bladder taken out  her pancreas is also in danger  She is now in kidney failure and should be starting dialysis but can not because she has no insurance. It is now a life and death situation for Tonya; so we are asking for help  any help is appreciated. She  still is needed on the earth. Tonya has her daughter and new grand baby who want and need her very much.  just like the rest of the family.Anything that is given will go towards medications and specialist we THANK YOU in advance for anything you may be able to offer! If you are not aware of what Lupus is it is a auto immune disease some have it worse than others Tonyas happens to be debilitating!

But the building was damaged in the basement and kitchen.  Today i received a phone call  saying that everything in my apartment is a loss. All my documents  my children's clothes  toys  movies  bunkbeds  irreplaceable photos  coats shoes  everything. This is the 2nd time in my life i lost personal belongings by the actions of others.

They are all I live and work for. I am asking for help for my children. Thank you.God Bless""",655,5000,13,13,14,84,6

Ashley&apos;s cancer treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/ashley039s-cancer-treatment,1,PITTSBURGH,PA,My sister  Ashley  is 34 years old. She is a survivor of armed domestic violence and over the past few years  has finally been able to get her life on track. She has  met a wonderful man who is now her husband  found her dream home  and been blessed with a son.Unfortunately  however  we recently had devastating news. Ashley has been diagnosed with Stage 3  highly invasive breast cancer and does not currently have health insurance (due to circumstances outside of our control). Before her diagnosis  she and Ben (pictured) just recently got married. As a result  Ashley can no longer receive medical assistance from the state of Virginia and was supposed to be added to Ben's insurance. However  the insurance company has refused to add Ashley since the request was submitted 3 days too late. Ben's employer is trying to appeal this decision  however  the outcome is uncertain. We have also applied for Obamacare  but this process is slow  and they have not yet accepted our request. It is also not guaranteed that they will.In the meantime  we are asking for aid so that Ashley can get treatment very soon. Since the cancer is highly invasive  there is no time to waste. We do not want to leave her 2-year old son  Eli  without a mother. I also cannot imagine a world without my sister.We will accept help in several ways. The first is through a monetary donation to help with medical bills. The second is through suggestions for her to get insurance or financial aid for treatment. She will have an MRI on Friday (Oct 12) and will discuss treatment options the following week. Your initial support will go to pay for the MRI  and any additional support will help with subsequent treatment. Please help me to save my sister's life. She is very strong  but needs all the support we can give her to keep going. Thank you.,8575,20000,21,43,68,183,6

Dr Jay&apos;s Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/dr-jay039s-cancer-fund,1,LAKEFOREST,CA,Please help Dr Jay and I stay in our home while Jay fights stage 4 lung cancer.  Like many families in America  we were one diagnosis away from disaster. In August of this year Jay went to the ER for severe chest pain (on his Harley!) which turned out to be a pulmonary embolism and thrombus in the jugular vein.  A later biopsy revealed stage 4 lung cancer which has spread to the lymph nodes in his chest  neck and underarm. Because the doctors can't find a primary tumor in the lungs  Jay's oncologist reports that his cancer is inoperable and incurable. Rather than risking illness and loss of work from standard medical treatments Jay has chosen to forgo radiation and chemo for 3 months. Instead  he'll be following a raw vegan juicing protocol and other natural cancer treatments. UPDATE 2/12/19: Jay started immunotherapy in January and the puffiness in his neck (from cancerous lymph nodes) has gone down significantly! Still sticking with a mostly vegan diet and other supplements. Jay has spent his entire life in service to others. First  to his country in the USMC  to his family & 3 beautiful children  and to his patients as an amazing and dedicated chiropractor. He wants nothing more than to continue working and treating patients.   Jay has already lost weeks of work and I'm on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). We live on a very tight budget so we're already struggling to buy the necessary supplements & organic produce in addition to medical bills and rent.  Please help us reach our goal of six month's rent so Jay can focus on healing without the added stress of losing our home. ❤,4840,19200,9,25,47,406,6

When they ruptured this caused bleeding and swelling on the brain.   The doctors have Kylee in a medically induced coma so the swelling around the brain can go down.  Another procedure will be needed to either repair or remove the damaged blood vessels. This process could take as long as 2-4 months.   This means that Shelly and Bobby are barely working because they are spending most of their time at the hospital with their baby.   Any amount you can give to keep this family from having to think about work instead of being where they are needed the most is greatly appreciated.  Thank You!,15050,10000,12,151,135,888,6

"Leap of Faith- Ashley, Brody, Mason",https://www.gofundme.com/Leap-of-Faith--A-B-M,0,EDMOND,OK,"UPDATE: January 17  2019Happy New Year! In starting the new year  I want to update you on how Ashley is doing- how she is coping financially and information regarding her health. Ashley is on long term disability.  She is paying premiums for Cobra insurance. Her only jobs currently are her health and her boys.  My husband and I are very involved in Ashley's life.  We see or talk to her every day.  I hope to share with you as much as I am legally allowed to about her life and the status of her health.  Ashley is NOT allowed to post anything on social media.  So  all the information on this GFM page will come from me.People have been inquiring about sending text messages and emails.  Ashley welcomes and enjoys hearing from everyone  but please don't expect a reply.  You may get one  but she is forgetful and unreliable in most endeavors these days.EVERYTHING in Ashley's life is very different and new  and it all moves in slow motion.  Her body literally dictates her days and nights.  It is difficult and overwhelming to keep up with the many variables that can affect her pain levels.  But  she does her best in order to properly communicate with her many doctors and manage her pain.  Something as simple as a change in weather or just the everyday stresses of raising two boys and managing her own home can cause her to be in bed for 4-5 days.Her body and brain have responded fairly well to staying in a much-needed quiet and dark environment with as few responsibilities as possible and as much rest as necessary.  It has been frustrating to Ashley to move so slow  feel so helpless  and be so unproductive  because that is the opposite of her personality.  Unfortunately  right now  that aspect of her personality can be detrimental to her health.  She is determined to do whatever is necessary to be healthy and be a good mom for her boys.  She spends what little energy she has each day trying to maintain a normal life for her boys. She does very few household chores and spends time on the phone taking care of medical bills and making arrangement for overdue bills and doctor appointments.She continues to see several doctors and recently saw a functional medicine doctor.  He has run multiple tests that have allowed him to diagnose several issues that traditional medicine never found.  He has changed her diet (gluten-free) and has recommended several different meds and supplements that she is hoping will make a positive difference in her health.  Unfortunately  neither the doctor  the meds  or the supplements are covered by insurance.  Her neurologist changed her migraine injection medicine to Ajovy.  January was her second injection of this medicine.  We are hopeful that this new med works better and has less side effects than the previous injection.  Ashley and I have sat down and worked on a budget that allows her to keep her credit score safe and her creditors happy with as low a payment as they will accept each month.  We have also had the major discussion that addresses the fact that she needs to relocate closer to town.  Her house and acre are unmanageable  and her budget can no longer support this property. She also needs to be closer to doctors  family  food options  etc.  At this point  the idea of moving seems completely impossible  but it will have to be addressed in the very near future.  Ashley's current disability income does not meet her monthly needs.  This is where she must depend on God and the temporary charity of friends  former co-workers across the United States  former parents and students that she taught  and family to help her make it through this time. In our discussions and prayer time about life  Ashley constantly shares stories about her many friends  co-workers  and family.  She loves to reminisce about her “best days.” She has been blessed with a tremendously loving family and devoted friends and co-workers.  I am counting on this community to come through for her in this time of need.  Ashley loves BIG.  She gives of herself to everyone BIG.  She has always been there for whoever needs her BIG TIME!   She needs for you to return the love and help her at this time in her life.  Our goal is to supplement her income so that she can keep a roof over her family's head  keep her family fed  pay medical bills/needs  and relieve as much financial stress as possible so that she can concentrate on getting healthy and well.  We love and appreciate those of you who have donated and been an active participant in this journey through your financial support  love  and prayers. We pray that you will find it in your heart that you can continue to do so.  If you cannot afford to donate  please share this story and Ashley's need with your friends  family  churches  and colleagues.I am reminded of Jesus' words in Matthew 25:40b \whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine  you did it for me.\""  I am looking forward to continuing to help Ashley through this Go Fund Me site  and I am asking you to join me. Love BIG for Ashley! Prayers for God’s blessings for every person who reads this and considers how they can help. With much love  appreciation  and prayers for each of you and your families.

Ashley was bright  full of energy  loved kids  extremely organized  had a wicked sense of humor  and pumped new life into my 31-year teaching career.  She inspired me to be a better teacher and professional.We became fast friends and close co-workers.  We worked beautifully together.  Even after she left teaching for a new occupation  we stayed in touch and made an effort to see each other on a regular basis.  When she gave birth to twins in 2009  I took personal leave to be with her and the babies for a few days.  I can’t remember a time during our co-working relationship or friendship when Ashley wasn’t dealing with some type of pain.  During our years of teaching  I prayed daily for her physical well-being.  She worked through headaches  back pain  endometriosis and infertility  migraines  and the stress of constantly finding and trying new medications that would allow her to continue to take care of her twins and be on top of her job.  I admired her ability to always show up and push through the pain.  I was shocked she was able to continue her job and be a single parent without any opiates  but that was (and still is) Ashley’s choice to make. I was constantly amazed at her determination and pain tolerance.  Little did either of us know what Ashley’s body was trying to tell her.  Ashley and I were not only good friends  but we also became prayer partners because we both shared a strong faith in Christ.  We prayed for God’s will in regards to her wanting children  for her headaches that would not respond to any medication   through her divorce  and her constant search for doctors  treatments  and medications that would give her some relief from all the pain she was suffering from.   We also prayed that she would be able to continue to be a good mom to her boys and have enough stamina to continue her job.  Our faith has grown through this long and arduous journey  and God’s grace has proven to be sufficient.  We continue to pray for healing and relief from the pain in HIS perfect time  either by a miracle or doctors and medications.   We are choosing to trust God in this area.  Ashley has always been fiercely independent and had a tenacious work ethic.  It has been extremely difficult for her to ask for help and to reach out to others during this process of her body shutting down through pain.  She has made every effort to win the battle against her pain  but she is losing the battle. After attending a few doctor appointments with her  hearing the doctors tell her how seriously her body is shutting down   and experiencing a few black out moments  we knew she had to make a major decision.  Ashley’s body and her doctors are telling her that she must quit work  rest  and let her new meds and many treatments help her heal.  We both admit to the fear that rears its ugly head when we consider a significantly-reduced income for a single mom of twins  but she is taking a leap of faith in this journey and trusting the Lord to provide for her and her boys. After much discussion  prayer  and convincing Ashley that she should stay home  slow down  and concentrate on her health and her boys  I asked her if I could start a Go Fund Me page to relieve some of the financial burdens of her treatments  medications  and supplements. Ashley’s neurologist has even mentioned sending her to a migraine hospital in another state  but we have to get Ashley healthy enough to travel first. The following is the information we want to share regarding Ashley’s journey.  We have documented the process for medical and personal reasons.  Ashley is a single mom to incredible 8-year-old twin boys  Brody and Mason. In 2014  she  was diagnosed with a severe neurological disease  chronic migraines. She is one of less than 1% of the population with this incurable  chronic  severe migraine diagnosis. For those of you who have ever experienced a migraine  you know it can completely incapacitate you. Ashley’s migraines occur daily; there is usually no end to one before the next one hits. Because of their chronic nature  she may be afforded one or two days a month where she is “functional.” The rest of the month is spent managing her symptoms  and she is often bedridden in complete pain. To make matters even worse  Ashley has severe scoliosis. She has a 41-degree curvature in her back with spinal abnormalities and nervous system and brain malfunctions.Those of you who know Ashley know she is a workaholic who puts 100% into everything she does. Her goals for the past two years have been to be successful at her job and to take care of her precious boys (and give them as normal a life as possible) despite her diagnosis. But every aspect of this family’s life has been interrupted and is now completely shut down by Ashley’s neurological disease.Up to this point  she has been fortunate enough to keep her job  but as difficult as it has been for her  she is realizing she cannot go on as things are. She feels like a failure as a mother and at taking care of herself. All signs point to the fact that her body is shutting down. Her immune system is compromised due to her extreme pain levels  so she gets sick easily. Most recently  Ashley passed out in pain while her children were home. They found her face down in the laundry room. They got her back into bed  and she was able to text me for help  but it was a terrifying ordeal for all of us.Ashley has always been able to hide her pain and symptoms  but they have become too much for her to bear. Daily she experiences severe head pain  mental fogginess  dizziness  sensitivity to light and sound  visual impairment and loss  fatigue  ringing in her ears  loss of strength and energy  no appetite (she is on appetite medication)  short-term memory loss (she is on an Alzheimer’s medication)  neck and shoulder pain  back pain  a droopy left eye and nausea. Ashley’s doctors have not been able to get her pain down to a manageable level in months  and her body is showing signs of distress. Her team of doctors has strongly advised her to stay at home to give her body a chance to respond to the various treatments and medications she is prescribed. They have told her no work  no stress  no major physical activity  and no travel. While I absolutely agree that Ashley needs all of these things  it also means she needs help with necessary daily activities: rides to doctor appointments  running errands  grocery shopping  loading groceries and running the boys to sports and school activities. In the past three months of being on medical leave due to her condition  the freezer went out and hundreds of dollar’s worth of food spoiled. Ashley was diagnosed with shingles due to stress  she needed new prescription glasses due to vision loss  the boys’ shower started leaking and had to be repaired  the dog got sick  and the hot water tank went out and had to be replaced-  thousands of dollars! This family needs help.Although Ashley’s official \""chronic migraine\"" diagnosis came in 2014  she has documentation discussing her body aches and migraines with her primary care physician for more than twenty years. This is not something that happened overnight; pain has been a part of Ashley’s life as long as she can remember!Ashley has tried traditional medicine and treatment as well as Eastern medicine. She has been to doctors  specialists and \""healers\"" of every imaginable kind. She has tried acupuncture  chiropractic care  holistic medicine  medication after medication  counseling/therapy  orthotic lifts in her shoes and under her rear end  bite guards  consultations with neurosurgeons and most recently in 2017  a two-week stay at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN. She has had injections in her back  neck  and head to reduce pain: none have worked. She has tried the sphenocath procedure. She currently undergoes Botox injections every three months. The number of medications and supplements that she is taking is overwhelming and exhaustive! There is a new monthly injection that Ashley is now being prescribed called Aimovig. It is supposed to be a miracle drug for those suffering from migraines  but it is $575 a month and not covered by Ashley’s insurance plan. The company that created Aimovig says  \""People with frequent migraine may lose more than half their life to migraine. They endure debilitating pain  physical impairment  and live in constant dread of the next attack – all of which is compounded by a widespread misperception of the disease.2 The 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study ranks migraine among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability worldwide.3 Migraine is associated with personal and societal burdens of pain  disability  and financial cost  and it remains under-recognized and under-treated.2\"" (In most of Ashley’s cases  her treatments and meds are not covered by insurance).  Ashley loves and thrives on taking care of others  but she isn’t so good at taking care of herself. She is  though  learning to listen to her body and what it needs rather than ignoring the pain signals. Ashley does not ask for help and is very uncomfortable with it. But  this disease has humbled her in the last six months. We need a community to rally around Ashley and her boys right now. That’s why we are choosing to take this leap of faith and reach out to others in what seems to be a scary and unpredictable future for Ashley  Brody  and Mason. Our prayer is that God will use this community and whomever else He chooses to help. We will be asking for—and truly need--everyone's assistance  so please think about how you can help ease her burdens  financially or otherwise  and meet some of this sweet family’s needs.""",6850,13001,24,53,33,68,6

Just a Year,https://www.gofundme.com/just-a-year,0,SEDROWOOLLEY,WA,2 weeks ago  I was participating in my second Warrior Run. 5 km and 13 obstacles.  My goal was to finish and better my last years time  if possible.  On the 12th obstacle  a split second in time  my life for the foreseeable future was changed.I dislocated my right ankle and broke it in 3 locations.A couple of hours  and two ambulance rides later  I arrived at the hospital and the healing process began.  Within 24 hours  I had had surgery  adding 3 plates and a handful of screws to my ankle  and I am now in the position of sitting/laying with my leg up doing NOTHING while depending on my family and friends for everything.I am self-employed as a Mobile Notary Public / Certified Signing Agent.  I travel extensively  meeting my clients at their descretion  and putting thousands of miles on my car monthly.Since moving back home to Washington State a year and a half ago  ( a divorce after 28 years...where else do you go but home)  I have slowly built my business up to where I am now booking appointments up to 3 weeks out.  The future is / was looking good.Now  I can put no weight on my right foot / leg for at least 8 weeks.  No driving  walking etc.  Then  it will be re-evaluated and I go from there.  The orthopedic surgeon has said that I am (realistically) looking at 9-12 months for complete recovery. Patience   which is NOT my strongest suitand  therapy...lots of therapy.I have great clients but of course they can’t put everything on hold for upwards of a year while I heal. I will have to build my business up from basically the ground floor again.I am not asking to be completely supported for the next year.   What I am asking for is help with my rent for the next year. If I knew that I would not loose the roof over my head  I could make the rest work. I do not have a car payment or credit cards etc. so I am looking at monthly living  expenses.  I CAN make that work...I just need a little help.I have never reached out to others  nonetheless complete strangers   for financial help and I do find this very difficult.  If any of you find that you can assist me  it would be greatly appreciated.  More than I can say.Thank-you Crystal,790,15600,23,5,9,22,6

She will have a double lumpectomy Wednesday October 10th. Chemotherapy and radiation will soon follow. Valerie and Jeremy are a force to be reckoned with. They are standing united with their 4 beautiful children- trusting God in all things. Many friends in the Lawrenceville  GA area are coming through with meals  maid service etc  however financially all of Val's testing is draining their savings- and soon will be depleted.

I’m clumsy guys I can’t catch for my life  my world dropped. I have been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. It’s a blood Cancer  yes it’s curable thank the Lort. I will need Chemotheropy to get better. Although it helps treat and cure cancer there are many side affects to chemotheropy  one of which is Fertility Problems. Chemo therapy fights cancer but also kills a woman’s eggs jeopardizing the possibility to ever be able to conceive. I will get better and I will fight this even if it comes back but I still want to be able to have a child in the next two years. There’s a process to freeze my eggs until I get better so I keep the chance to have a baby  and that’s where I need your help. If there’s one thing I want from life is to be able to be a mother  so to anyone that can help whether it’s just sharing the post or donating yourself it’ll all truly be appreciated.

Cristan Ramirez,https://www.gofundme.com/cristan-ramirez,0,SANANTONIO,TX,As many of you may or may not know over the last year-and-a-half Ive develop some major medical issues that I've been dealing with and that has kept me from working.  You may also know that I'm a very private person and like to keep things in my immediate circle.  This is something that I'm working on daily.  With that said please understand that this is totally out of the norm for me but I do realize that my family needs help.  Please note that the goal that I set is just a number and I have no expectations of meeting  it  so if anybody can give anything even a $1 or $2 that would help us so much with bills and with me getting back to my doctor and specialist.   Continueing the treatment for my amputation and other illnesses that I have is priority.  You have no idea how it pains me to have to admit this but with all the bills that have been adding up over the past 6 months or so and my wife Angela busting her butt working two jobs trying to make ends meet and dealing with me in the process lol is not easy at all.   2018 has been the worst year of my life   my family needs some relief.   With me unable to work right now makes things super hard and I know everybody has their story but this is mine.  I filed for SSI and have been denied twice because they don't consider my amputation or any of my other medical conditions severe enough to receive any type of disability   so we are taking the next steps to deal with that.  They also say my medical conditions will not last more than 12 months so  in about a year I'll finally have my chance in court to see a judge and plead my case  but until then I feel like the only option is that I'm going to have to get better at walking again properly  and deal with the amount of intense pain that I'm in daily all I want is to support my family and give wife Angela a break.  I am also in the beginning stages with my VA doctors and that's a process in itself  thankfully we believe some of my medical conditions are linked back to my time in the military  but again this is a process that we're currently going through.  I do want to say thank you to my mom and dad other family members and friends who have supported us throughout this painful process.  There's no way in my lifetime of the next that I could repay or say thank you enought for everything that you've done for my family so far.  So in closing   if there's anything that you can do to help it would be greatly appreciated and most importantly please do not at anytime feel obligated  that is the last thing that I would want and that is not my intentions. Thank you. The Ramirez Family,770,5000,4,15,8,201,6
Deb&apos;s Journey to Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/deb039s-journey-to-recovery,6,CLARINDA,IA,*SCROLL DOWN FOR UPDATE*My name is Samantha and I am raising money for my mom Debora Swanson. For the past year my mom has been have unexplained pain that radiates through her back and down her leg. She has been to numerous doctors and no one could tell her why she was having pain. She has tried going to the chiropractor  massage therapy and many other things that did not even put a damper on the pain. The pain has gotten so severe that she is walking with a walker and sometimes even uses a wheelchair. We cannot do simple things like take the dog for a walk. My mom bartends as a second job and with the pain she has not been able to work and has lost that income. My mom lives in Iowa and I live in Kansas  so not being able to be there for her and take care of her has been hard on both of us. I want more than anything to be able to go stay with her and be a light in this time of darkness but unfortunately  I cannot take that much time off of work. Recently my mom went to a specialized doctor and they told her that she needs to get a hip replacement. Finally  after a year of pain and suffering  my mom has a diagnosis. When she told me about the hip replacement  she was not worried about the surgery  she was worried about how she would pay her bills while she was recovering and could not work. Hearing her say that broke my heart. She has done everything in her power to make sure that I had a roof over my head and food on the table and now I am going to do everything in my power to ease her  mind and let her focus on getting the treatment she needs. Growing up with a single mom was not easy but we made it through. My dad passed away in a boating accident when I was 8 months old and I am an only child so there is no one else to turn to in her time of need. Insurance will not cover the cost of the entire surgery. I am doing everything in my power to help cover the cost of the surgery but I just graduated college and am living paycheck to paycheck. Any donations that we receive will go toward medical bills and physical therapy after the surgery. Any amount that is donated is appreciated and will be life changing to our family. Please help anyway you can.-UPDATE-Everything went great after surgery. My mom was doing great and had even gone back to work! Last week she was putting out the trash and slipped on a patch of ice. She fell and broke her knee cap in half. It was in the middle of the night and she did not have her phone. Luckily she had her keys and somehow scooted herself to her car (Which took 45 minutes). She then drove herself to the ER. They did an X-ray of her newly replaced hip and the knee that she fell on. Luckily the hip was okay! Unfortunately the knee cap was broken. They did surgery two days later. They were able to save the knee cap using screws. She has now been in the hospital for a week. They say she needs to stay in the hospital for two more weeks for physical therapy because she cannot bend or put any weight on her injured leg. She had just got her life back and was feeling like herself again. When will this amazing woman catch a break? She informed me that insurance might not pay for any part of her stay in the hospital. On top of not being able to work and going through so much pain  she has to worry about her medical bills piling up. She appreciated everyone who had donated when she was getting her hip replaced! Any donations would help put a small dent in the large amount of medical bills she now has!,1190,10000,9,12,21,184,6

Curtis&apos; Cancer Care,https://www.gofundme.com/curtis039-cancer-care,6,GEORGETOWN,TX,Curtis' Stage 2 oropharyngeal cancer (cancer where the tongue connects to the throat)  unfortunately has returned. The treatment diagnosis is surgery that will remove most of his tongue and also his larynx (to prevent food from going down into his windpipe and causing pneumonia). Because of his treatments earlier in the year we have maxed out all of his medical leave; so although his work teammates have generously donated sick days to him  we are very concerned about the loss of income during this time. Curtis will be unable to work until he completes therapy and learns how to speak again using the stoma in his throat  and even then his job prospects are lean because of the throat stoma. If he is unable to return to work for some reason  we will also lose our medical insurance. So for those reasons we are looking for any help with covering our basic bills in the near future as he undergoes surgery and therapy following and is unable to work  and potentially medical bills if there are complications or we are unable to afford insurance.

Helping a fellow friend and colleague,https://www.gofundme.com/friends-of-joe-daniel,7,Toronto,ON,Joe Daniel  a community builder  and former MP  needs your urgent help. In late September he suffered a severe stroke resulting in the paralysis of his left side.  Thankfully  he continues to make important strides but the road is proving to be long and he needs the support of his family  friends and colleagues. First  a little about Joe.  Joe Daniel  a professional engineer and one of the foremost project managers and specialists on helicopters.  He immigrated to Canada to help with the building of a 2nd generation ‘search and rescue’  helicopter. When he served as a Member of Parliament  he was active on the “innovation and industry” portfolio.  Joe Daniel is also passionate about helping disadvantaged people of the world.  During his term  he was Canada’s representative to the EU for world TB eradication.  He also traveled to Sri Lanka and India to raise funds  both for libraries for rural areas and for a solution to produce a dry anti-venom for snake bites. Here at home in his former riding  Joe has a track record of helping thousands in the old riding of Don Valley East.  Since then  living the motto of ‘force for good’  the be-of-service kindhearted Joe continued his always supportive and helpful attitude.  His devotion to helping youth extends from being a devoted Big Brother for over a decade  teaching in the electrical engineering program at Centennial College and mentoring in his spare time.  He works tirelessly helping numerous local startup companies and charitable causes here at home and around the world.  Unfortunately  Joe has served only 1 term and does not have the pension support many MPs enjoy.Then  in late September  he suffered a stroke leaving his left side paralyzed.  Since that September event  with persistence and indomitable will  Joe continues to improve day by day.Determined to make a full recovery  he needs our help. Joe's determination and persistence can very much use your help and support  How?  An interesting fact.  The Ontario Government Healthcare system is not supporting Joe's healthcare needs.  This includes EVERYTHING from his hospitalization to his therapy needs that is imperative for stroke victims to recover.   In fact  now knowing this  ALL money raised from this campaign will ONLY go directly towards helping Joe manage the expense of long term care and rehab treatments.  For example  one physiotherapy session (of which he requires 3 per week) did cost $300.00 CAD per session.  However  the physiotherapy clinic has pitched in to help by reducing the session cost to $150.00 CAD per session plus transportation to get to physiotherapy is $180 CAD return.  This means Physiotherapy is $990CAD per week alone.  In addition  his hospital accommodations are around $2 000 CAD per month.Finances are managed by a team of volunteers with financial experience and legal counsel from Joe's personal lawyer.  Furthermore all proceeds go to a separate informal trust account to provide assurance that the funds are available for Joe's recovery efforts. Due to the kindness of a few individuals   they have donated funds to help cover his first few weeks of therapy.  As of his first therapy session which was February 11th  2019   Joe was able to stand and use his left arm to help support himself by the end of the first session.Just as important are your prayers  best wishes and infusion of positivity for Joe’s full recovery.  Please continue to send your good wishes for a fast recovery and/or stop by to visit Joe for a chat or a challenging game of chess - he still rocks at it!  He would be most delighted.   The Heart and Stroke Association estimates that victims of strokes take between 4 to over 12 months for optimum recovery.  Once Joe has recovered and leaped back into the fray  whatever that may look like  all remaining proceeds from that point will be donated to the Heart and Stroke Foundation to help others and we will conclude this campaign.   Time is of the essence and your timely help is very kindly appreciated. A very sincere thank you  Friends of Joe Daniel (JD),12700,100000,33,13,46,44,6
Todos X Edmundo/Everyone 4 Edmundo,https://www.gofundme.com/todos-x-edmundoeveryone-4-edmundo,3,PEARLAND,TX,For english  please scroll downESPAÑOLMOVILIZEMONOS POR EDMUNDOEdmundo es padre  hermano  amigo  hijo  sobrino  nieto  cuate… y queremos que siga con nosotros por mucho tiempo más. ¡Ayúdanos!El 28 de septiembre de 2014 inició para la familia una gran batalla que nos tomó por sorpresa. Esa noche  a Edmundo lo sorprende una crisis convulsiva que supimos que era hasta que se pudo acceder a servicios médicos de emergencia esa madrugada. Pasado este terrible episodio y recuperado de los dolores musculares y la incertidumbre  acudimos a un especialista para conocer qué era lo que sucedía. Se realizaron estudios de tomografía  resonancia magnética  química sanguínea y electroencefalograma entre otros. Días después como resultado de los estudios nos enteramos que Edmundo alojaba en su cráneo un tumor cerebral del tamaño un poco menor de una pelota de tenis (razón que hasta entonces supimos era la causa de los dolores de cabeza que desde mucho tiempo atrás padecía pero que erróneamente los achacó al estrés laboral) y había que operar lo más pronto posible. Se buscaron alternativas y médicos especializados en la materia y dado el tamaño del tumor la única opción en ese momento era una cirugía de cerebro con bisturí. La primer craneotomía se realiza el 18 de febrero de 2015  la cuál tuvo que detenerse de manera abrupta por complicaciones cerebrales  ya que se presentó una gran inflamación en el cerebro y la recomendación del neurocirujano era detenerse para evitar secuelas irreversibles y así buscar continuar 24 a 48 horas después  manteniéndolo en coma inducido y en terapia intensiva durante ese lapso de espera.  El 21 de febrero del mismo año  se realiza  con consentimiento de la familia  la segunda craneotomía para terminar de extirpar el remanente del tumor.  Esta cirugía tiene una duración de 4 horas (adicionales a las 7 horas de la primera) y el pronóstico inicial indicaba una parálisis motriz total del lado izquierdo de su cuerpo. Después de casi 80 horas de coma inducido  recupera el conocimiento y la familia pudo entrar a visitarlo. El 23 de febrero  ya en su habitación del hospital  se confirma que necesitará terapia física para recobrar la movilidad y fuerza de su lado izquierdo  aunque afortunadamente no existía perdida total de motricidad. El 25 de febrero  se realiza la curación de la herida para el día  siguiente recibir el alta del hospital y poder regresar a casa.12 meses después  en chequeo de rutina  se identifica la reaparición del tumor como consecuencia de remanentes no retirados del tumor original  pero este de manera más agresiva y creciendo rápidamente. Esta vez  afortunadamente se pudo realiza un procedimiento a base de rayos gama llamado Gamma Knife para poder destruir el tumor con el uso de estas radiaciones   cirugía que se lleva a cabo el 29 de marzo del 2016. El resultado y pronostico después de esta cirugía fue alentador  pues finalmente se esperaba la destrucción por completo al tumor.Meses después  las convulsiones vuelven a aparecer alertándonos de que algo no andaba bien. Se realizan nuevamente los estudios y chequeos  dando como resultado la aparición de 2 nuevos tumores en diferentes ubicaciones del cerebro. Es por esto que hoy solicitamos tu aportación para poder enfrentar nuevos procedimientos médicos y tratamientos posteriores  ya que la situación económica se ha vuelto insostenible para él y la familia por tantas intervenciones  medicamentos  médicos y esto aunado a la desafortunada falta de empleo. Para nosotros es muy importante que las fuerzas no decaigan para Edmundo y poder afrontar en parte todo este proceso nuevamente.Te agradecemos y apreciamos mucho tu donación y tu apoyo.Si quieres ayudarnos a difundir esta campaña comparte en tus redes sociales y ayúdanos a superar este nuevo reto. ¡Muchas gracias!______________________________________________________________________________ ENGLISHLET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR EDMUNDOEdmundo is a father  brother  friend  son  nephew  grandson and “cuate ” and we want him to keep fighting.  Let’s help him.On September 28  2014  Edmundo and his family started a long and difficult battle.That night  Edmundo started having seizures  and we knew it was a medical emergency  so we got him the medical attention that he needed.   He was recovering from muscle pain and uncertainty  and he was taken to a specialist.  A few days later  after multiple tests and electroencephalograms  Edmundo was diagnosed with a brain tumor approximately the size of a tennis ball.  After getting second opinions  and researching all his options  it was clear that he needed surgery. The first craniotomy was performed on February 18  2015.  It was stopped abruptly because of complications and severe swelling.  The neurosurgeon's recommendation was to stop the surgery to avoid irreversible damage. He was in an induced coma for about 48 hours  and in intensive care for that period.On February 21 of the same year  the second craniotomy was performed with the consent of the family to finish removing the remnant of the tumor. This surgery lasts 4 hours (in addition to 7 hours after the initial surgery) and the initial prognosis indicated a total motor paralysis of the left side of his body. After almost 80 hours in an induced coma  he regained consciousness and the family was able to visit him.On February 23  in his hospital room  it was confirmed that he needed physical therapy to regain the mobility and strength of his left side  although fortunately there was no total loss of motor skills.On February 25  the wound healed enough that Edmundo was discharged from the hospital and was able to return home.Twelve months later  during a routine checkup  a tumor was detected.  The tumor was a result of remnants from the original tumor.  However  this tumor was growing aggressively and faster. Fortunately  this time around a gamma-ray procedure called Gamma Knife could be performed to destroy the tumor with the use of radiation.  The surgery took place on March 29  2016.The outcome and prognosis after surgery was encouraging  and the tumor was finally eradicated.A few months later the seizures started again  alerting us that something was wrong. Further checkups and tests identified two new tumors in various parts of the brain.That is why today  we are asking for your help.  Your contribution can help Edmundo and his family cover medically necessary procedures and subsequent treatments.  Unfortunately  the family is having difficulty covering so many new expenses such as doctor’s visits  procedures and medications.  All this coupled with Edmundo’s current unemployment.  We don’t want Edmundo and his family to lose hope.  Every contribution counts.  We thank you and appreciate your donation and your support.If you want to help us spread this campaign  please share it on your social media platforms and help us overcome this new challenge.Thank you very much!,4435,13500,15,33,54,248,6
Another Lifeline for Scott,https://www.gofundme.com/helping-scott-kicklighter,6,HENDERSONVILLE,NC,"In April of 1997  Scott was diagnosed with autism.  Despite the negative and dismal predictions of the physicians and therapists  Scott defied EVERY SINGLE ODD thrown at him.  As a Life Scout with BSA Troop 605  he went to Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimmaron New Mexico and hiked over 75 miles with his expedition members and he did it with only what he could carry on his back.  Later that year  Scott achieved what only 10% of men in the United States are able to do.  Despite his communication difficulties  Scott led a project and went on to become an Eagle Scout.  In April of 2015  we noticed Scott started to shuffle his feet when he walked.  We assumed it was due to autism.  As the months passed  his hips seemed to be more and more effected.  We sought medical attention.  His PCP sent him for an MRI.  The MRI was clear.  Not really knowing what else to do  the PCP sent him to see a neurologist.  She ordered a battery of tests  and said \I'm stumped.  I would like to refer him to a teaching hospital.\""  We went to Wake Forest first.  Their diagnosis was varied from \""we think he has ALS\"" to \""we think he has a stretched out central nervous system.\""  Months went by without a follow up.  Finally his mom got fed up and took him back to the neurologist and asked for a referral to Duke Neurology.  In the mean time  Scott has lost almost all use of his hands and arms.  This makes it difficult for him to steady himself and catch himself with his arms should he fall.  On August 20th  while walking into the hospital for physical therapy  Scott tripped on his toes (they now drag)  and landed on his chin on the tile floor.  In addition to cutting his chin open all the way to the bone  he broke his chin in two.  Because of the nature of the break  and the possibility of ALS  we were taken by EMS from Parkridge Hospital to Memorial Mission Hospital.  It took 7 consultations from every sort of physician to approve his surgery.  You see  people with ALS often don't recover from anesthesia.  They end up on a ventilator for long periods  if they come off at all.  His surgery was successful  and to everyone's surprise  he was able to come home following surgery that night.  On October 2  2018  we finally went to the initial appointment at Duke.  Duke ALS clinic is a multidisciplinary clinic.  You see a speech  occupational  respiratory  physical therapist as well as an engineer  an ALS chapter representative  your doctor  a social worker and the lab people if you need additional blood work.  The diagnosis was confirmed.  Scott has complained of tooth pain since his fall.  The surgeon thought he had two concussed teeth.  The dentist said \""I hate to tell you this  but they are not concussed  they are fractured.  They will need to be extracted  and you will want to replace them with implants.  The average cost is $6500 with the extraction and implants.\""  Scott's dental insurance will not cover the cost.  It also won't cover some of the durable medical equipment nor the ramp that he will soon need.  I'm sure some of you think \""why would you replace the teeth of a dying child?\""  The placement of these teeth would impact his ability to speak and eat.  Scott's family are always the first to lend a hand to anyone in the community.  His mother is a teacher who has housed abused students  and his father is in retail.  They have drained every bit of their savings and any time they have to take off  they have to take off without pay (they exhausted their sick leave last year).  I am starting this fund in hopes of easing some of the financial stress they are constantly under.  Please consider helping if you can.  This is the only official Go Fund Me page for the Kicklighter family  and it is linked directly to their account.  I am Scott's aunt  and I welcome any questions you may have.  Some people have asked if Kristi has a paypal account.  She does.  It is paypal.me/KristiKick""",5820,15000,6,39,49,736,6
Angels Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/angel-in-helping-need,0,CARLISLE,PA,"Angel and Alex met and started their lives together in 2013 they have their ups and downs but always came through strong.  In 2014 they had their beautiful daughter Bentley she has been such a joy in everyone's lives making their family whole. About a month ago Angel got sick and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Sadly the diagnoses was wrong as we later found out.  Angel was rushed to the Carlisle ER after checking her heart rate at work which was at 160 BPM. When arriving to the hospital she was taking tests and given xrays to later find out she was diagnosed with heart failure. Till this day they still have no idea what caused it. Later on she was moved to Harrisburg Hospital and there they couldn't resovle anything and was transported to Hershey where she currently lays for the last 2 weeks. She went through surgery and they added an impella. Short description of what an impella is \Impella is a family of medical devices used for temporary ventricular support device in people with depressed heart function. Some versions of the device can provide right heart support during other forms of mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and Centrimag.\"" With that being said when the Impella is removed and they see no progress she'll need a heart transplant. We're scared  worried  and all we can do is pray and take it one day at a time. Meanwhile Alex and Bentley have been visiting as often as possible with a drive from Carlisle to Hershey. Depending on others generosity to go back and forth since they are currently without car and with very little money while Angel is off her feet indefinitely. Alex is a stay at home father and was hoping to start working while she's in the hospital but they're struggling with a baby sitter and there car recently broke down in the midst of this happening. It's been a struggle for friends and family alike.  Everyone has been trying to help where they can but they could use all the help they can get. This is why were asking for any donations you can spare even a few dollars could be the difference between getting a visit together for this family and keeping momma fighting this fight daily. With Angel in the hospital for weeks already and weeks possibly months to come they will need money for even the most basic of necessities like food and utilities. Again  anything can and will help this family and it is much appreciated.""",4185,10000,6,42,66,1000,6
Help defray Ellen&#x2019;s medical costs,https://www.gofundme.com/help-defray-ellens-medical-costs,9,SANDWICH,MA,As many know  Ellen Sullivan was diagnosed and bravely fought Ewing’s Sarcoma at age 6. After over two years of chemotherapy and radiation she was deemed cancer free and remained in remission for 20 years.Last week after delivering her second daughter  doctors found a mass on her lung and in her heart  both determined to be a recurrence of Ewing’s Sarcoma.  Ellen underwent 17 hours of surgery to remove the masses on Friday and again on Saturday due to some predicatible complications. She remains in ICU at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston but is recovering well.  Ellen will receive ongoing treatment for Ewing’s once she has recovered. The road ahead is long for her and her family fighting this disease again as a new Mom with two small children. Insurance will help  but expenses are mounting for transportation  food away from home  daycare   and lost wages - now and in the forseeable future. Any amount to help this family is greatly appreciated. 10/12 Edit: At Ellen’s request  Kenny Lynch  her significant other and Peyton’s Dad is managing donations until she is well. Updates will be posted.

Violets for Violet,https://www.gofundme.com/xp5rhb-violets-for-violet,9,ALPENA,MI,On October 4  2018 Violet McLaren  10 year old daughter of Andy and Sarah McLaren  was rushed to C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor  MI with a possible virus in her heart. She was exhibiting initial signs of congestive heart failure. Since arriving the doctors have determined that Violet has a heart condition called “Dilated Cardiomyopathy” or DCM.             DCM is a condition in which the heart’s ability to pump blood is decreased because the heart’s main pumping chamber  the left ventricle is enlarged and weakened.              She is currently stable and on a medication to help her heart function better. There are signs of improvement but many more tests are needed to determine how to proceed. The doctors have talked about long term oral medication  continuous infusions and a possible heart transplant.             As a result of her condition  Sarah and Andy spending as much time as they can with Violet for her duration at the hospital. Funds are being raised to help relieve some financial stress for medical and traveling expenses.,4705,10000,8,47,67,703,6
Amelia&#x2019;s fight against Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/amelias-fight-against-cancer,1,STEPHENSCITY,VA,On October 5th Angela (Bristol) & Adam Sharers’ lives were flipped upside down when it was discovered that their sweet little girl has cancer.  Now instead of enjoying life as a typical 4 year old Miss Amelia is in the most difficult fight of her life.  Amelia will undergo a biopsy & port placement tomorrow.  The cancer has spread to her lungs so her treatment will likely be chemo to shrink the tumor  surgery to remove her right kidney & mass  chemo again and probably radiation.  Because of a recent move & job change the family does not have health insurance or paid time off for their jobs.   As you can imagine the financial burden will be huge with medical bills along with travel and meals  as Amelia is in Pittsburgh at UPMC Children’s Hospital.  Amelia’s mom  Angela says  “Amelia is strong and she’s a fighter.  She’s ready to kick some *butt*!”Please give what you can to this beautiful family & if you can’t give financially  share with your friends & send Amelia lots of prayers!,28035,40000,20,70,325,1000,6

Help Kelsea &amp; Patrick with KLS!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-kelsea-amp-patrick-with-kls,0,WESTBROOK,ME,In 2016  Patrick  who was 10 at the time  started sleeping like crazy.  Way more than usual for a kiddo at his age  and we weren't sure what was going on.  After being told it was puberty  then mono  then maybe narcolepsy  we finally got a diagnosis for Kleine Levin Syndrome in 2018. For those of you who aren't aware  Kleine Levin Syndrome is classified as a rare neurological sleep condition.  It's characterized by episodes of deep  prolonged sleep which last between 18-22 hours a day  for anywhere from 2 days to a month at a time.  While in an episode  patients also lose a large amount of cognitive and memory function  and can experience hyperphagia (binge eating).  There's no real treatment  except letting the patient sleep.  There's no predictability to the episodes - when they'll happen or how long they'll last.  When he's in an episode  it's kind of like Patrick turns into a giant toddler  and he needs help to do things like get meals  shower or remember how to do things like getting dressed.  As a result of Patrick's illness  I had to leave my job to take care of him.  It's impossible to be a good employee who shows up at a job 40 hours a week  when you don't know if your kid is going to wake up on any given day.  When I left my job  I started my own event/wedding planning business  but due to the nature of the biz and how far out I book clients  I'm really struggling financially right now. I've hit the point where I need help - credit cards are maxed out  and family has given what they can.  I'm so embarrassed so this is pretty much the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  Funds will be used to do things like cover co-pays on medical bills  buy oil  pay the mortgage   keep the lights  phone and internet on  and buy groceries.  Anyone who knows me  knows that I believe in helping my friends  family  loved ones and community in small ways: a place to sleep during a breakup or warm place to be when you run out of oil and won't get a delivery til the next day  an extra place set at the dinner table  doing research on resources when a pal just doesn't have the spoons  etc.  If there's any way I can pass on your generosity  please be assured  I'll do my best to follow up!,1588,5000,14,32,30,156,6

Medical Expenses for my Dad,https://www.gofundme.com/dkjgtg-medical-expenses-for-my-dad,6,BECKLEY,WV,My father has struggled with some medical issues for the past 2 years. On September 11th he had his first surgery to have a colofistula repair. This ended with part of his colon being removed as well as a small portion of his small intestine. During his hospital stay he had to have a 2nd surgery because his intestine dropped and twisted. Since then he has been transferred to Ruby Memorial Hospital because he was getting worse. Today we received the news that he will have to have drains placed in his kidneys because due to a hole his urine is accumulating in his abdomen. This process to remove all the inflammation will take at least a month. After he his a little stronger another surgery will be required. I am asking for help for my parents today because my mom has to be with my dad. She is the only income source for them  and obviously she is unable to work. If you would like to help please donate what you can. Most of all though please pray for my dads healing.

With the Sox losing by 3 runs  Xander Bogaerts hit a screaming drive directly at them for an awesome home run  exciting the home team and the Sox fans in attendance. As shown by the video  the home run ball bounced back onto the field after hitting the beer he had put on top of the wall in order to try to catch it. Unfortunately for Randy  not only did he lose his beer  he also lost a tooth after the hard-hit ball went through his hands and hit him in the mouth.Video: Tooth-Destroying Home Run The tooth was found  but unfortunately  it couldn't be reattached  resulting in the need for a tooth replacement. Also  the bridge he had for his lower front teeth was also damaged  likely also requiring replacement.As any retiree on a fixed income knows  an unexpected large medical expense can cause financial hardship for any family. Randy has some insurance (Medicare  etc.)  but that insurance won't cover the whole cost of his dental work.Won't you please help this Vietnam vet and avid Boston sports fan get his teeth fixed?Thank you,830,5000,20,17,16,48,6

He is a true lover of outdoors - hunting  fishing  4 wheeling  and hanging out at Kerr Lake with friends are some of his favorite past times. He enjoys spending time with his nephew  Brantley  teaching him to love and respect outdoors. Riding dirt bikes  ATVs  sitting back and listening to country music  and lending a helping hand is where he can be found when not spending time with family.  Kent recently suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) due to an automobile accident. He is still in ICU and when the doctors feel he is well enough to travel  he will be released to a rehabilitation center that will most likely be out of town. His parents (Sean and Amy Roghelia) will travel with him and will incur unexpected travel  housing  and medical expenses. All donations big and small will help with these expenses and are appreciated more than words can say. Thank you in advance for all the PRAYERS  TEXTS  CALLS  and POSITIVE VIBES!  Let's come together in support of the Roghelia family as they travel down this long road of recovery and bring Kent home where he belongs!,895,10000,2,9,16,700,6

"Our Mom, Our Hero",https://www.gofundme.com/68cp4lc,0,MEMPHIS,TN,"How does one begin to put into words what cancer does not only to the person diagnosed  but also to their family  friends and even co-workers? You constantly hear and read stories of those affected by this awful disease but honestly  never think that it will be you or someone you love. My beautiful mother Jayne aka Bebe  had to break this news to us a couple weeks ago. She has been diagnosed right now with Stage 3 Breast Cancer. As we wait anxiously for her to get in with a medical and surgical oncologist  we continuously are praying that the cancer has not spread to any vital organs or her bone. Due to the size of my mom's tumor and it being attached to 3 lymph nodes  a total mastectomy can not take place until rounds of radiation and chemo are completed in hopes to shrink the size of the mass. Any funds raised will go toward her treatment regimen  medications and surgeries  because as many of you know  insurance only pays so much and there will be many days she will not be able to work. She will not ask for any help because that's just the person she is  but as her daughter  it is my turn to help and support her  and to be her rock and greatest supporter as she has ALWAYS been for my sister and I. Let me begin with saying that my mom is the prime example of \Treat others the way you want to be treated.\"" She has always put everyone else before herself even if she barely knows you. Jayne has been a Labor and Delivery/OB nurse for 30+ years and I cannot tell you how many of her patients continue to keep in touch with her and thank her for saving not only their lives but their baby's lives as well. This is her passion though  and anyone who has EVER had the honor of meeting my mom  will say just that - she cares about everyone  wanting their happiness over her own and is truly a genuine and down to earth person. She has the biggest heart and has made such an impact in so many people's lives. Despite any chaos or stress in her own life  she always has a smile on her face and remains optimistic; I honestly don't see how she does it. Therefore  I strive every day to even become half of the woman that she is. When one thinks of what a perfect mother would look like  my mom is her. From the day my sister and I were born  she has sacrificed and loved us with all of her being; she has showed us what true and unconditional love really means. From every school or sporting event  school projects or driving us to and from wherever we asked  she was there. With every heartbreak  tear  smile  laugh and accomplishment  we always knew she would be by our side and that nothing would ever have to faced alone. This woman  who I am so blessed to call mom  is absolutely beautiful from the inside out. She is my constant supporter and continuously encourages me to follow my dreams and aspirations to be the best me possible. My mom is not only my mom either  but my very best friend. I just can't imagine doing life without her yet and I feel we still have so many memories to make. Her first grandchild will be here in April and I know she will fight as long and hard as she can to be a part of and watch this child grow. She deserves that  plus more! My mom is truly an inspiration. She loves fully and whole heartedly and lives her life through Christ. She has touched the hearts of so many and now I want to show her how many people love and support her  and will be there every step of the way to overcome this battle with her and beside her. Our family truly appreciates and thanks each and every one of you who donate or even share her story. She is already my hero and angel  and I could never write in enough words how much she not only means to me but so many others. She keeps our family whole and even with this diagnosis  remains positive  happy and full of love just like she always has. It's nothing short of amazing how this beautiful individual lives life. As we have said from the get go  \""We Got This!\"" Nothing will tear us apart and together  we can get through this like we have many other obstacles throughout life.""",2775,15000,8,19,21,218,6

Zeron Smith&apos;s Heart Transplant Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/zeron-smith039s-heart-transplant-fund,9,ATLANTA,GA,Today I urgently come to my friends  family  and the world to help me give my son Zeron Ryan Smith 39 years old another chance to live a life as normal as we all do.  It all started in February 2012 when Zeron was having chest pain and had a heart attack.  The doctor noticed his heart was working on 38% then.  He then had another heart attack in March 2013 his heart was down to 25 % and the doctors decided to install an pacemaker and defibrillator. On Easter Sunday 2014 my son Zeron went to church with me and we had dinner at my house later that day.  I took Zeron home and within 30 minutes he was having a massive heart attack even with the devices installed.  Zeron has been through so many surgeries with fixing leads in the defibrillator and getting an infection after the lead was fixed.   He recently had surgery last week to remove the infected device and is facing another surgery within the next two weeks to replace the temporary device with a permanent device.  All these surgeries has weaken Zeron's heart even more to only 8% and now he is a candidate for an heart transplant which can give him another 30 to 40 years in life.  God has big plans...Zeron is currently 39 years old with two daughters  a family  and a hosts of friends whom loves him dearly.  He has so much to live for and I really believe that God has a purpose for Zeron because of all of the heart failures and surgeries he's been through.  Zeron will one day share his testimonial with every one and I believe this is God's will for Zeron and each one of you.  The Atlanta Emory University doctors has cared for my son's heart problems from day one of his first episodes these are some awesome surgeons and doctors who calls my son the (MIRACLE) one.  Now they all have come to the conclusion that he will not survive without this heart transplant.  In case you didn't know heart transplant cost almost or over one million dollars.  The medication is very costly and very so more important to be able to afford to stay alive once the transplant is done.  This fund will provide assistance for any out of pocket assistance that is needed such as pre and post transplant expenses  medication expenses  transfers to/from hospital visit expenses  insurance co-pays  or deductible expenses and any other expenses that will occur during the transplant evaluation period and after. A desperate mom...This is very urgent for my son to receive this heart transplant and If each an everyone of you will please donate what you can from your heart it will well be appreciated and Blessed by the Grace of God. I also need another favor if you can forward this fund raiser to your family and friends that would also be awesome.  Feel welcome to raise funds from your churches  jobs  or any other resources you may have access to and donate it through the GoFundMe page.  If you cannot afford to donate this is okay please send your thoughts and prayers for God's Grace and for healing health to Zeron.I would like to thank you all in advance for the thoughts and prayers and any donations given to this fund to help give my only son another chance at a longer life.Thanks and God Bless each and everyone of you.Carla R.

Sandra McClinton,https://www.gofundme.com/sandra-mcclinton,6,RIOVISTA,CA,"Family and friends of Sandra McClinton are raising money to help cover the costs of her pending double lung transplant.We've chosen GoFundMe as an option because their platform is well known and their administrative expenses are low (2.9%).  You can be certain that at least 97% of your contribution will be used to cover the costs of Sandra's surgery and rehabilitation.About Sandra:Sandra has Sarcoidosis  a disease that commonly attacks the lungs but can effect any organ in the body.  It is a slow progressing disease that she has had for 30+ years. Recently Sandra was diagnosed with end-stage lung disease and her only chance for survival is a double lung transplant.  She has been accepted into the Heart and Lung Transplant Program at UCSF and has been on the transplant donor list since March 2018.  \I feel blessed to be a part of the UCSF program because they are one of the best in the country \"" she says.  However  it is going to be an expensive undertaking. Sandra has health insurance and some savings  but one of the UCSF requirements is to remain no more than 30 minutes away from UCSF for at least 6 weeks following the surgery.  This means she will have to stay in a hotel for at least 6 weeks at a cost of approximately $140.00 per night.  After the surgery there are roughly 30 medications that Sandra will need and some of them cost $10 000 per month.  She has prescription drug coverage but her deductibles and co-payments will be high.  She also doesn't know how much the surgery will cost and what those deductibles and co-payments will be.  There are other miscellaneous costs  but the surgery and medications are her major concerns. Any and all contributions -- no matter how small -- will help cover the costs of Sandra's double lung transplant. They are deeply appreciated.""",1520,10000,13,15,9,57,6

Dorothy Rennox&apos;s Road to New Lungs,https://www.gofundme.com/our-mom039s-road-to-new-lungs,0,Blenheim,ON,Two months ago my phone rang; it was my Mom. My stomach flipped. It seems more often than not lately  when I hear from her  the news isn’t good. She tells me that her Doctor has told her she has two years to live. This is her story. Really  we could start this story when she was a wee lass  growing up in a very small community in Scotland where her family home was heated by burning coal  but let’s fast forward a few years. She lives in Canada now. My brother and I are grown and have families of our own. We always knew that our Mom had problems with her lungs like Asthma and mild COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)  and we knew lung problems ran in her family  but things really began to escalate when in January 2012 she got her first bout of pneumonia. Because of the already weakened state of her lungs  her diagnosis of mild COPD became chronic. That winter was the worst; her first bout landed her in ICU for 10 days and on life support for 3. Over the next few years she would visit the hospital twice more and contract a severe case of pneumonia 7 more times. During that time she had such a severe anaphylactic reaction to a medication that her lungs stopped functioning. It was really by chance and a case of the right place at the right time that saved her life that day.Each case of pneumonia was slow torture; as my Mom describes it  “I felt like someone had put a plastic bag over my face with one tiny hole to breathe through for weeks at a time.” She was put on strong antibiotics which would clear the infection up for a while  but then she would gradually get sick again.It took some time  but eventually it was discovered through a barium test that each time she swallowed  a minute amount of the food or liquid was going down into her lungs causing these infections. There was great concern that she might choke to death on food and the only way to deal with it was to put in a feeding tube. She was told that this would be for life and that she would never be able to eat or drink anything again. The prospect of this was daunting and took all of her courage to face. About 1 week later the feeding tube was planted just above her belly button. The incision became severely infected and required a trip to the ER where they manually removed the infection which she says was excruciatingly painful but necessary.While on the feeding tube she began to question one of the medications she was taking for her COPD. Although her doctors didn’t believe her she became convinced after reviewing her own medical records that one of her puffers was causing her cough. All of her doctors disagreed with her and felt the benefit of the medication was more important and did not believe it was the cause but that her cough was a symptom of the COPD. Since being on the feeding tube her cough had receded and so she conducted her own experiment. She took herself off the medication she suspected and within 2 or 3 days she was able to drink a whole glass of water without stopping  successfully. She then called and made an appointment with her respirologist who arranged for a second barium swallow test. It was performed on the exact machine and by the same technician who was amazed to find that her swallow was now entirely normal. Her Doctors agreed she was having an allergic reaction to her medication and immediately took her off of it. She had correctly identified the problem and her feeding tube  rather painfully was removed.By this time though  and as a result of these several aspiration pneumonias  my mom had already developed a secondary lung disease called bronchiectasis. She has been on supplemental oxygen for about 2 years now and her usage has gone up quite dramatically. She now can’t be without oxygen for more than 5 minutes. If she contracts any sort of lung infection  head cold  common cold or flu  her doctors tell her it’s very likely that she will die. She is permanently on antibiotics to avoid this. She is now starting down the long road of preparing for a complete double lung transplant. The hard work for her has already begun to prepare her body  to help keep it as fit and healthy as possible  for the incredible task ahead. The risk of rejection in this sort of procedure is high so the work done before and after in incredibly important. There’s a 20% chance she won’t survive  but we are putting our hope in that 80%. She takes pulmonary exercise classes twice weekly and works out in the pool 3 times a week  taking her oxygen as far as it will go with her  and does what she’s able to. For the last year she’s undergone much testing  has been deemed fit in all other respects and was invited to go to Toronto University Hospital for final assessment before being placed on the wait list for transplant. The process requires that the patient have a support person with them at all times and they that they live in Toronto close to the hospital for at least 3 months and possibly up to 2 years post-surgery. My parent’s home is about 300 km from Toronto  so they are obligated to move and sell their house.The cost of living in Toronto has reached an alarming high  it’s now almost impossible to rent a 1 bedroom apartment for under $2 200 CAD a month and to be close to the hospital that could be up to $3 500 or more. For one week in Toronto for testing  living and staying as frugally as possible  they spent $1 500 just for accommodations  gas and food.  https://www.blogto.com/city/2018/08/cost-of-living-toronto-young-people/ My Dad works 2 jobs and is attempting to start his own business. I won’t go into their financial troubles  but they’ve had their share  and are now faced with selling their house  moving expenses  medications and other medical costs  hotel and travel expenses  wear and tear on their vehicle  finding healthy and happy homes for their many pets  and must either have my Dad stop work to support her or pay for a support worker. With a conservative estimate of $3 000 a month  for a year to live in Toronto that’s $36 000 in rent alone. The money that we raise here will go to their living and medical expenses through this process. This is the most personal thing that I  or my family  have ever shared and my Mom was very reluctant to participate. Watching her go through this however  and the quiet strength of my Dad as he supports her in so many more ways than just financial  breaks my heart.If I could pay to support them through this  I just would. Sometimes though  you need to ask for help. And if money isn’t what you have to give  a ‘like’ or a ‘share’ can go a long way. From all of our family  her husband  children and grandchildren  thank you for staying till the end of our story and for helping us give to it a happy ending.,1965,30000,7,7,20,266,6

Help Settle Allison&apos;s Affairs,https://www.gofundme.com/yccdx2-help-allison-fight-cancer,0,Victoria,BC,Allison is one of the kindest  most understanding  and loving human beings that you could hope to meet in life. She is type of person that inspires everyone to do wonderful things with her tireless work to help everyone around her and make the world a better place. For the past 35+ years  Allison has dedicated her life to working with the most vulnerable populations of people; the people that are often forgotten by the system and need constant  intensive care to survive. Many of them suffer from both severe physical and neurological disabilities  and even abuse at the hands of the people that were supposed to take care of them throughout their lives. Allison has always been there for them  acting as a steadfast advocate for change and acting as a mother to all around her. She has not only proven her desire to make the world a better place in words  but also in the actions that she has taken over her whole lifetime. She has worked hard to never be a burden on other people or society  instead working extremely hard to provide for her family  continue her work  and help others.This time  Allison needs our help. On the eve of a new chapter in her life  working to create a brand-new program for people with disabilities that would enrich and better their lives  she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  which came as a devastating surprise.Allison also has two loving sons  Ben and Adam. After tragedy struck her husband  Allison carried on raising their children all alone; determined to give them the best life possible and continue her work helping the most vulnerable people in our society. Adam has Autism and Down syndrome; he requires more care than most people and in Allison’s current state  it is difficult for her to give him the attention that he needs because she is fighting for her life each day. Nevertheless  in the face of ovarian cancer  and the horrible sickness that comes with it  she is using all her energy everyday to make sure that his needs are met even before her own. Anyone who has met Adam would say that he brings joy to everyone he encounters with his positive attitude and happiness  which is a testament to the love and care that Allison has provided him throughout his life. Ben is currently in university  hoping to get a degree in neuroscience; he’s juggling a full-time university course load  working to meet his own expenses every month and providing what he can for his mom. With all these responsibilities  it’s impossible for Ben to do everything for his mom  especially since somebody needs to care for Adam full-time.Allison’s most recent job was managing a group home for severely disabled people. After putting in a truly herculean amount of time and effort into completely revitalising the state of her group home to become a place where the residents were genuinely happy to live and were well taken care of  she decided to start her own program that promised to do even more for the vulnerable people that she dedicated her life to helping. Before she could take her new position  she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  and became so sick that she was no longer capable of working as the exhaustion and symptoms proved to be too much. This sudden diagnosis  at the worst possible time  means that she does not have extended insurance or an income. Even though she has worked selflessly and tirelessly for decades to provide good lives for the most vulnerable people in our society  Allison risks losing everything. Without your help  she could lose her home  her loved ones  and her life. She has never asked for help  instead doing everything in her power to work hard and never burden anyone  but she is out of options at this point. Without an income or insurance  she needs money for life-saving treatments that are not covered by MSP  money to help with Adam  and money to pay her bills because she is unable to work in her condition. Without your help  Allison’s future is uncertain; it’ll be impossible for her to work while ill. She risks losing her home  her child  and even her health without help from you.Please  give what you can for Allison  who has dedicated her life to helping all those who need it  and now needs help herself for the first time.,1935,10000,11,19,13,93,6

Elise&apos;s Gender Confirmation Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/elise039s-gender-confirmation-surgery,6,COOKEVILLE,TN,Hello!For those who don't know me and happened to stumble upon this webpage  my name is Elise. I am a 20 year old transgender woman.As far back as my memory goes  I've always known that I was supposed to be a girl. However  the community I was raised in completely rejected who I was. At the age of 18  I told my family that I wanted to become a woman. To no one's surprise  I was thrown out of my home and forced to live life on my own.Shortly after  I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and decided to come out to the world as my authentic self  Elise Noelle Galea. Then  I began to receive medical treatment for the dysphoria. This treatment  known as hormone replacement therapy  helped me become the woman I am today. It alleviated some of my dysphoria but it didn't solve all of my problems. I decided that having gender confirmation surgery (GCS) would be the next step I should take to align my body with my female brain.The past several months have been very difficult for me. After exchanging several emails   contacting countless medical professionals  and undergoing endless examinations  I have finally received the date for my gender confirmation surgery: May 14th. I am having my surgery with Dr. Chettawut Tulayaphanich MD in Bangkok  Thailand. I am both incredibly excited and nervous to embark on this journey  but I am without a doubt certain that doing this will greatly increase my quality of life. This surgery is not cosmetic. This surgery is proven to cure gender dysphoria  and it is the last step I need to take to finally feel like a complete person.At this point  all the help I am asking for is to cover the travel and hotel expenses. The hotel itself will cost approximately $1 900 and the airfare will cost upwards of $1 800 as well.Any help is greatly appreciated. Feel free to share! :)With love Elise Galea,430,3000,6,14,13,184,4
Our Week Hospital Stay @ MUSC,https://www.gofundme.com/68d6r9s,9,LEESVILLE,SC,Those of you that know us  know we have been trying to find  I guess not a cure  but a way to make Timmy's life medically comfortable and safe. He was born with primary lymphedema and intestinal lymphangiectasia. He has swollen extremities and because of the IL his body doesn't absorb nutrients the way it should. His immune system is dangerously defenseless  the common cold has hospitalized him before. We have started seeing a new and better doctor in Charleston  SC. She wants him to stay the week of November 12th to redo numerous tests and procedures that he had when he was younger because she can't seem to get ahold of all his records from Columbia  SC. This week long stay will initiate the start of taking him to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This also means my husband and I will both be out of work a full week with NO PAY. Any donation will help  big or small  even if you can only give prayers  we take those too!!!!! Thanks in advance to everyone!!!! ♡♡♡♡,910,1500,3,61,9,267,6

Betty touched so many of us  and so many who have inquired are not here in Jacksonville to participate in meal trains or the fundraising activities we are having on-campus. In the spirit of providing Betty and Gary some financial ease  we invite you to participate in this online event  \""A Christmas Gift for Betty.\"" No amount is too big or too small! Donations will go towards ongoing medical expenses and upkeep. Gary is working part-time so that he can help Betty as she needs it  and Betty is no longer with the claim department at DCIS.

Let&apos;s Help James Mcdonald- Army Vet,https://www.gofundme.com/let039s-help-james-mcdonald-army-vet,6,ENCINITAS,CA,Hey everyone. I’ve never done one of these but felt like I needed to do something to help a friend and a veteran who spent time in the United States Army protecting you and I. James McDonald is a friend of mine that I met at Gracie Barra Encinitas. He is a solid family man that is respected by all who have had the pleasure to meet and spend time with. He is a former wild lands firefighter for the CDF and former US Army infantryman. He has been protecting and serving his fellow citizens as well as raising a family. The problem arose when he sustained an injury to his knee that requires surgery. He was recently laid off of his landscaping job and has been picking up piecework to make ends meet. Since he was laid off  he lost his medical insurance and decided to go to the VA to get help with the cost of surgery. He was denied and now does not have a way to pay for the surgery he needs to get back on his feet. It is a sad state when our veterans are denied help by the government when they are in need when they have risked their lives to keep our country safe. I don’t think this is right and want to help rectify this situation and help James get back on his feet so that he can get back to taking care of his family and being able to get back to a normal life. The government won’t do it  so I am hoping that we will. Thank you and anything helps.,2100,10000,26,21,20,33,6
David&apos;s homeless prevention fund.,https://www.gofundme.com/Davidshomelessnessprevention,7,PLEASANTGARDEN,NC,Booleanenator aka David has been in a rough spot this year. With no job he has been living off of savings and disability.  He and lookapig are getting an apartment together to cut the cost of living for david.This money will be used for moving himself and his service dog to the apartment 1k miles away from where he currently stays.Dave has been out of work since May. He had burned through his 401k and has been unable to find a new job. There's not a whole lot of openings for microprocessor engineers out there. He has had a steady stream of interviews  but sadly no one has hired him.His  current apartment costs $1200/month. He gets $600/month from the VA under his disability.. The only way to sustain himself is to get a roommate. Lookapig has graciously offered to do this. It benefits him as it allows him to get life experience and it allows david the breathing room to pursue the kind of job  and education  that will carry him forward.,2125,3000,43,71,41,18,6
Let&apos;s Help Wayne &amp; Nina,https://www.gofundme.com/let039s-help-wayne-amp-nina,9,GILLETTE,WY,In February  Nina’s husband Wayne became very sick. At first  they thought it was food poisoning  but it was a very serious  life threatening blood clot in the main vein into his liver called a portal vein thrombosis. After spending several days in the hospital in Bozeman  the doctors found severe liver disease. Then after he was life flighted to the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City  the doctors there determined Wayne also had liver cancer. They determined that his best chance of survival was a liver transplant. In June  they treated the cancer and when they did  Wayne’s diaphragm was stunned. This happens quite often  but it recovers. His diaphragm has not recovered and is not working  so it pushes up against his right lung and the lung can only fill about half full. Fluid builds up around his lungs and he has to go to the doctor several times a week to have the fluid taken off by a procedure called a thoracentesis. All that fluid’s a terrible feeling – he says it feels like he’s drowning. In August  doctors at Huntsman Cancer Center in Salt Lake City (there are no doctors in Montana that can do this procedure) inserted a Denver Shunt into his right side that has a tube from below his lung that runs up to his artery in his neck. A small squishy type ball in his chest has to be pumped 4-5 times a day and at least 20 times each time to keep it working properly and keep it from getting plugged. Of course  throughout this whole ordeal  Nina was missing a lot of work. Ultimately  she was forced to quit her job. While back in Montana during another hospital stay  they received the call that Salt Lake City possibly had a liver for Wayne. It turned out not to be viable  but it made them realize that they needed to be closer to Salt Lake – they needed to move. So  Nina’s been trying to pack up their house  sell things  take other things to storage . . . I can hardly imagine the stress that Nina’s under right now. But you all know Nina – you know the beautiful person she is. It shouldn’t surprise you that she said  “I’m keeping a positive outlook and keeping the faith  and just kind of living day to day and trying to make every day count and be happy and special.” When I approached her about setting up a GoFundMe page  she was emotional and so very grateful. It’s hard for her to ask for help  but she knows that to get through this  she’s going to need all of our help. She says that she appreciates our help more than she could ever express. Please do what you can to help our dear friend in need.,2950,40000,11,7,34,231,6
Help for Healing,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-fund-for-healing-tiffany,1,ROUNDROCK,TX,"Less than a week after my 40th birthday  I was diagnosed with breast cancer. This diagnosis holds a lot of emotional weight due to my family’s history with the disease. However  it is also my family’s history that has driven my research into cancer and health the past few years. That research is now proving to be an invaluable asset.The initial phone call that included the words “Invasive Ductal Carcinoma” came as quite a shock. I will not lie and say that I was not scared. I was. Emotional wounds regarding the term “cancer” run deep. But my logical brain slowly regained control over my emotional brain and the fear subsided. I know that EVERYONE has cancer in their body at any given time. I also know that for cancer to be multiplying and creating cysts or lumps  there is a problem with my immune system. I know that a lumpectomy or mastectomy will not fix the problem – cancer will just come back somewhere else – and have therefore ruled out those suggestions. I know that I must find out what is wrong with my immune system and fix the root of the problem. I know that fixing the problem and giving my body the nutrients and supplements it needs will rid my body of cancer and prevent it from returning. I know that based on the size of my “lump ” I have most likely had this cancer “multiplying” in my system for over 10 years – since before my mom died!This means that  although I already did many things toward living a healthy lifestyle PRIOR to the diagnosis  even more drastic changes were made immediately. I will see a doctor later this month who has had great success treating cancer naturally. At that time  she will create a specific regimen for me based on my body and the DNA of the cancer. This will include supplements  therapies  dietary guidelines  and anything else that may be necessary.I am happy to share any and all details of my journey with anyone interested. I also plan to start a Facebook page and/or a blog with specifics to keep everyone apprised of the situation. I hope to truly be an example of healing the body naturally. First and foremost  please keep us in your thoughts and prayers. The journey ahead is sure to be taxing on all of us emotionally  physically and financially.Second  if you feel compelled  we would greatly appreciate any financial help you can provide. All of these expenses will be paid out of pocket. Insurance does not cover anything “natural ” only pharmaceutical. We have already paid over $5000 leading up to diagnosis for tests & procedures. We estimate that additional tests  supplements  therapies  etc. will reach over $2000/month. We are unsure how long these treatments will need to continue. We will also be incurring travel expenses  since the doctor is out of state. While we were in a position to live comfortably prior to this news  the extra burden these expenses will take is overwhelming and stressful. Third  please support me and my decision. I know the importance that positivity  support and love play in the healing process. I do not make decisions haphazardly. I do not make decisions based on what anyone tells me to do. I base decisions on FACTS gleaned from research. I know that individuals who treat cancer naturally have a far greater success rate. I have made this decision with my life and my family’s welfare at the forefront. Whether you agree with my decision or not  please - only love and support. Last but not least  please do not use the \c\"" word around my children. They know both my parents had cancer and died. We would like to avoid any unnecessary worry or trauma that word might cause. We have told them I have a bad germ in my body and must figure out how to make it go away so my body can be healthy again. From the bottom of my heart  THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME IN MY HOUR OF NEED""",3508,30000,6,12,28,410,6
Mobility scooter and lift for Dad,https://www.gofundme.com/mobility-scooter-and-lift-for-dad,0,JAY,FL,So in August we found out my dad has stage 4 soft tissue sarcoma. He can't walk without crutches and he's only able to be up on them for a short period of time. He's always been an outside kind of guy  working in the yard and tinkering in his work shop from dawn til dusk. Its been a few months with tests and biopsies and collapsed lungs and doctor's appointments with still no treatments or any definitive news other than diagnosis. I dont know if the insurance company will help get him a scooter and a lift so he can at least get out and do anything besides sit in his room all day or not. So I'm going to try and see if I can't just get him one now. He needs this. He needs to be able to get out and be as close to normal as he can to keep some hope up and fight this. I dont want to lose my dad but even more so I dont want my dad to think he's stuck with no options. And this small thing may not mean much to others but to me  seeing my dad be independent again and out of that house is a huge thing. Can you folks just please help us out and show this hard working guy some love? I wish everyone who saw this could meet my dad. He's a one of a kind and he's worth this and a million more,290,3000,6,10,8,124,6
Help Tammy Ballard Beat Leukemia!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-tammy-ballard-beat-leukemia,0,WETUMPKA,AL,My friend Tammy is one of the sweetest  most helpful people I know  and she needs our help.Tammy has been diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) which is an aggressive type of acute myeloid leukemia in which there are too many immature blood-forming cells (promyelocytes) in the blood and bone marrow. This buildup of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body. APL  and the treatment for it  leaves Tammy vulnerable to infections  bleeding  and bruising  along with many other side effects including tiredness  fevers  and shivering.Initially Tammy was treated at UAB with Chemotherapy every day for 28 days; she was in the hospital for over a month – 37 long days.  She also received blood transfusions and platelets to help strengthen her. Although she is home now  she must take two different types of Chemotherapy five days a week for the next eight months. Her Doctor said the Chemo is needed for at least eight more months because he has seen a single cell or more hide from a shorter treatment period  and the APL comes back. Tammy prays  and asks you to pray with her  after she undergoes another eight months of treatment she will be cancer free for life.It goes without saying that this news has turned Tammy and her husband Wayne’s world totally upside down.  It has been devastating  scary  confusing -- and it's all happened so unbelievably fast. All of this started two short months ago and no one has had much time to really think about the financial impact this is going to be on Tammy and Wayne. The focus so far has been on saving Tammy’s life.  Truth is  not very many people could live for 10-12 months on 1/2 their income with innumerable medical bills to come. No one knows what all this will cost  but everyone can agree that Tammy and Wayne should not need to be worrying about the upcoming medical bills  lost wages  travel expenses  and all the costs that come along with the road ahead. Financial burdens should not be an obstacle on the road to recovery. As Tammy’s community of support  lets join together in uplifting her. We can do this in 3 ways:1. Support the “Help Tammy Ballard Beat Leukemia!” Go Fund Me2. Share the Go Fund Me page on your social media outlets3. And Most Importantly  Pray!!!Whatever your finances may allow you to afford  we come full of gratitude to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Any way you can support is greatly appreciated.  We serve a BIG GOD who  through us  can bless our friend Tammy in the toughest fight of her life!,1495,10000,7,15,24,305,6
REX vs. CANCER,https://www.gofundme.com/rex-vs-cancer,1,MESA,AZ,"UPDATE 2/22/2019:It is with a heavy heart to have to report our very dear friend Rex Reynolds has lost his battle and fight with cancer.  Rex left us and the bondages of this evil disease on Wednesday  February 20th 2019 and is now at peace.The funds raised thus far has been used to help with insurance premiums  deductibles  and prescriptions/treatments not covered by insurance.Any additional funds raised will now be used for final expenses/needs for Rex's wife and family.  Please help spread the word.A message from Rex's wife Dawn:\Some have asked if they could help with remaining expenses for Rex’s care and lost wages. He had short term disability the first few months but was without income for the last few months.We are not in dire straits so my intention is not to actively solicit funds. Only to give a vehicle if it has been laid on your heart to give so there is no need to share this post.You have poured out so much love to us and we are truly grateful. That encouragement kept us going every day. It made it impossible for us to stay in the grips of despair.There were too many of you watching and cheering us on. It lifted our hearts when nothing else could. Our lives are forever changed by all that has happened and you helped make it possible to see more than the negative. thank you. Dawn\""***************************************************************************Hi friends  on behalf of Rex's wife Dawn - and after all they have been through and learned over the past few months - we want to provide a more accurate summary of what is happening to Rex and his battle against cancer:Dawn - December 4th  2018: \""This is an attempt to explain what Rex has  what he needs  and our plan to get it for him. I have compiled this information from numerous sources and tried to put it in the easiest to understand terms. I may not explain some of the details correctly but it’s my best attempt at a summary for you. If you would like the sources  I can email them to you.What Rex HasRex’s cancer was first diagnosed in his esophagus in early August  but as his treatment and testing continued  his diagnose changed Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (GJA)  which is a rare type of esophageal cancer. It starts in the gastroesophageal (GE) junction  where the esophagus and stomach join together. Again  as treatment and testing continued his doctors discovered that Rex has Signet Ring Cell Gastric Carcinoma (SRCC) which is an even more rare (5% GE cancers). This type of cancer is most often diagnosed at a younger age  at a later stage and is much more aggressive. The median survival is 1 year  and 5-year survival is 7%. Rex was given 3 – 6 months but he is fighting harder than ever and determined to beat the odds. In fact  Zariah told me “Our family always beats the odds” and I am holding Rex to that. Preliminary research suggests that SRCC is increasing among younger patients and they do not have a clear reason why but there seems to be some genetic risk factors which we are personally looking into. There is not a lot of data for this type of cancer mostly because it is so rare. This is why we will be donating a portion of the proceeds from today’s event to Signet Ring Cell Gastroesophageal Cancer Research.What Rex NeedsHIPEC  is a form of chemotherapy administered during surgery  is performed at the end of surgery to remove abdominal tumors. Once all visible tumors have been removed  the surgeon continuously circulates a heated chemotherapy solution throughout the abdomen for up to 90 minutes. The HIPEC procedure is attempts to kill any remaining cancer cells that cannot be seen. The solution is then removed and the incision closed. By administering chemotherapy in the abdomen at the time of surgery  it allows for greater concentrations of the drug where it is needed. Advantages of heating the chemotherapy is that it more effectively kills cancer cells while having fewer effects on normal cells  the heat allows the chemotherapy to penetrate a few millimeters and kill cancer cells that cannot be seen  and the chemotherapy dose can be higher than intravenous chemotherapy because it is not absorbed by the body in the same way. We are hoping the HIPEC will cure the cancer but because he has an aggressive form  it could come back. There are no other options for Rex at this point so we are All In. This will give him the highest chance of survival for the longest amount of time. The procedure takes and average of 8-14 hours. Most patients are hospitalized for 2 to 4 weeks and complete recovery takes 3 months. HIPEC is a complex and invasive procedure and complications occur frequently which one of the reasons the hospital stay is so long. The most common complications are lung infections  wound problems and the inability to eat or drink  which Rex already has. Rex will have more chemotherapy 4 to 6 weeks after the HIPEC procedure  to reduce the chance of the cancer returning but we will be thankful for every day it gives us.Our Plan to Get it for RexEffective today  December 1st  Rex has United Health Care insurance and the Mayo Clinic is included in the network  which is where the only doctor in the state who does this procedure is practicing. Our oncologist has been in communication with him  we just needed the new insurance to take effect before an official referral could be made. Rex needs to meet with the surgeon to confirm he is a good candidate. Once he is approved we are ready to Rock and Roll with Rex at the Mayo Clinic.\""Please continue to share  donate  pray  send love & good vibes to Rex & his family!! https://www.facebook.com/Rex-vs-Cancer-225594644822710/""",3640,5000,12,73,40,265,6

Amanda DiMartino,https://www.gofundme.com/amanda-dimartino,0,PORTREADING,NJ,￼￼￼Hi Everyone. We wanted to give you an update on Amanda's progress 5 months after the accident.  Amanda had a successful skin graft surgery on her leg wound which has taken and is healing slowly.  She is in an aggressive physical therapy program  3 times a week  working on all injured areas.  She is unable to physically go back to work as of yet  as she is still very restricted in her movement and in a lot of pain. Tommy  who acted as the full time family caretaker  for Amanda and the two girls had to go back to work early January.  They were not ready for him to leave.  Amanda is still recovering.  Tommy was needed to take care of them  but he had to go back to work for medical insurance.  Despite being approved for the Family Medical Leave Act  where he was permitted to take a leave of absence to care for his family (who very much needed round the clock care) they were dropped from their family medical plan.  They will lose their insurance for six months  starting in April.  This should be illegal...if you are approved for this program  to take care of your family during an emergency  your medical benefits should be frozen and kept in the place for the entire time you are approved to be out of work!  You should not have to suffer more because you were needed to care for your family.  As the family  especially Amanda  cannot be without medical insurance  they are planning to enroll in Cobra  which costs a lot of money for a family plan.We thank you for all of the continued support throughout these difficult months.  We are all so grateful and blessed that Amanda and the girls are safe and that Tommy was able to take great care of all of them during this time.  Let's keep this momentum going  so that this young family doesn't suffer further with these astronomical medical plan costs.Thank You.Information on the accident:5 months ago  my sister Amanda was in a freak accident right outside of her home. After she parked her 2017 SUV and shut off the vehicle  she exited the truck  closing her door and immediately opening the back driver's side door to get out my two month old niece  Ali. The baby and the baby seat were taken out and placed on the sidewalk. She then opened the back passenger side door and my three year old niece  Gabriella  jumped out of her seat and was now waiting with her younger sister on the sidewalk.Amanda then reached and opened the passenger side door so that she could grab her baby bag.  At that time  the truck unexpectedly started to roll  catching her off guard and pulling her under the truck.  The truck continued to roll  dragging her down the street. It finally stopped rolling when it landed on her chest.  She was stuck under the car.  Couldn't call for help.  Couldn't move.  Couldn't breathe. Couldn't comfort Gabriella  who was screaming because she saw it all happen.As this was an almost silent accident with no real noise  no one came to Amanda's aid because no one heard it.She realized she was on her own and knew she needed to get out from under that truck for many reasons  but the first  was to stop Gabriella from running to her because she feared that truck was going to start to roll again...and this time  hurt them both.Thankfully  her mama bear adrenaline kicked in.  Still unable to speak  because there was an SUV on her chest  she wedged her foot in the wheel well area and slightly started to rock the truck back and forth a bit.  Believe it or not  she finally created enough momentum to dislodge the truck from her chest  causing it to roll off of her.  She then dragged herself  the car seat with Ali in it and Gabby into the house where she literally collapsed and called 911.  Amanda was admitted to the hospital where she needed immediate surgery to repair a ruptured spleen as well as be treated for fractured vertebrae  cracked ribs  punctured lung and an awful compression wound on her leg. She had road rash and was even missing clumps of hair on her head from being dragged. The compression wound on her leg proved to be the most difficult injury to deal with  as it landed her in the hospital 3 weeks later  when the site turned necrotic and needed over 6+ surgeries to clear the area. Once released from her 15-day hospital stay  she required a lot of at home care to keep the wound clean and maintained. At first  this was done by the visiting nurses who were coming every two days  but the wound eventually required daily dressing changes  2 times a day. Tommy  knowing this would be best  assumed that responsibility and learned how to change the dressing and take care of the wound.  This was all in preparation for the skin graft surgery which is a very intricate procedure and can only be done during a specific time throughout the healing process. Tommy was instrumental in Amanda's recovery on so many levels and for that  we will never be able to thank him enough.  This part of the process took over three months. Amanda continues to improve and is heading in the right direction.  Amanda's leg looks different but we are so very grateful that they were able to save it  which is something that the doctors couldn't guarantee us at the beginning of this awful nightmare.  Her new reality requires a huge adjustment  both physically and mentally.  Not only for her  but for our entire family.Gabriella still mentions Mommy's accident  their bad car and when mom had to stay at the doctor’s house.  Unfortunately you are never prepared for a family emergency.  And everything does change in a minute.  You just need to be there when there is one.  Love your family. Thank You.Original Post:Determined. That’s only one word we can use to describe Amanda DiMartino  particularly in light of the current tragedy. On the afternoon of September 4th  Amanda was involved in a very serious accident  which thankfully and narrowly  spared her life.  It left her with extensive physical damage including a fractured vertebrae  ruptured spleen  punctured lung  two cracked ribs  multiple lacerations all over her body and a very serious wound/hematoma on her leg.  Amanda has spent weeks in the hospital  undergoing surgeries and countless medications to fight infection. She continues to undergo medical procedures for the weeks ahead as she heals and regains her health.  The path ahead is filled with physical therapy  doctor’s appointments and procedures to help her regain her mobility.  Due to the extent of physical damage  Amanda has and continues losing precious time bonding with both her daughters. Gabriella  3  struggles to understand why mommy isn’t home  and Alianna  3 months old  is missing irreplaceable bonding time. Nonetheless  Amanda continues to put her girls first- pumping in the hospital so Alianna remains breastfed  even without mommy.  Once she is home  she will still be severely limited in her movement  which further adds to the emotional stress on the girls and Amanda. Amanda is blessed with a wonderful support system  husband  Tommy  and two beautiful daughters  Gabriella and Alianna  and an extended family who continue to cheer her on.  Gabriella often reminds mommy  she’s like Princess Poppy from her favorite movie Trolls  and encourages Amanda to fight to get better. Right now  the family is being challenged  but they continue to get stronger every day!  There is a bumpy road ahead to healing  but  again  I say the word DETERMINED.   She will GET BACK UP AGAIN!!Please  no donation is too small. All donations made to Amanda will assist with ongoing medical expenses  childcare  lost wages and more. Your thoughtfulness and generosity is tremendously appreciated. Keep Amanda and our family in your thoughts and prayers.Together  all things are possible. No troll left behind!Thank you!,11538,30000,14,38,140,701,6

Help John Tyndall Battle Lymphoma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-john-tyndall-battle-lymphoma,1,NEWYORK,NY,Dear Friends  Family & Former Fans After almost a year of doctors visits and endless medical testing  our beloved John Tyndall   who is 29 years old  was recently diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgkins Lymphoma. Due to complications  John will not be able to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatment and instead he will need to undergo an expensive experimental cell therapy treatment. For those of you who remember John from his early athletic days at Pacific Grove High School  or his four years playing fullback for the Cal Berkeley football team  you know that John is a fighter. Right now he finds himself in the toughest battle of his young adult life and in order to allow him to focus on the fight that is his health  we ask that anyone who is able to or would like to donate to his cause does so  so that he and his family can focus on the battle to save his life. ￼The money raised from this GoFund Me campaign will be used to assist John with paying for his treatments and his living expenses as he cannot currently work. It will also help the Tyndall family to be present with their son & brother as he receives treatment 2.5 hours away from their hometown in Monterey  CA. If you are unable to donate financially  we ask that you say a special prayer for John  that his body finds the strength to beat this. As he heads into a very tough few months  he has his sights set on hiking the Muir trail with his girlfriend Jess when he beats his battle with cancer. ￼May God bless each and every one of you. Our family appreciates this more than we can ever express. With all our love John  Jess  Cathy  Larry  Bill & Lauren￼,69841,125000,26,56,553,1000,6

Aunt Nellie Inogen Portable Oxygen,https://www.gofundme.com/aunt-nellys-inogen-portable-oxygen,7,CYPRESS,CA,My aunt Nellie has been living with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for five years. COPD causes the oxygen levels in one’s body to drop thus requiring an oxygen aid for 24 hours a day.  She also struggles with cirrhosis of the liver  degenerative joint disease and liver cancer.Her conditions require her to have 24  hour care   daily breathing treatments  intake of multiple medications  and an oxygen tank with her at all times.My aunt requires to intake 5-6 liters of oxygen constantly for a proper supply to fit her needs. Currently  at home she has a system that is stationary and provides this for her  but her current portable tank only supplies 4 liters of oxygen. Because of this  my aunt is very restricted whenever she leaves her home  which causes her to miss out on family events  being outdoors and in general limits her quality of life. To improve this quality of life for my aunt  I am looking to raise $3 000 to purchase an Inogen Poratable Oxygen System. This machine would provide the adequate supply of oxygen my aunt requires and would enhance her quality of life. Any donation would be greatly appreciated and the sooner we can raise these funds the sooner my aunt will be able to enjoy more of what life has to offer outside of her home. Thank you for your support and prayers.,1000,3000,10,33,18,140,6

He has been suffering for several years due to the lack of oxygen being pumped to his body and is currently unable to work and struggles as a single parent to keep up with his energetic 7-year-old son  Enrique. Robert now requires open-heart surgery to attempt to repair the mitral valve or replace it if needed. Robert's insurance is not covering any of the costs so he will be paying completely out-of-pocket (which is over $30k). His surgery is scheduled for November 8  2018 in New Orleans. He will be in the hospital for about 5 days before going home to Lafayette to recover which is expected to be about 6 weeks. Any donations would be greatly appreciated and will go directly to Robert for medical costs  travel expenses  childcare for Enrique  and/or meals during recovery. Robert will be unable to work for some time so any money donated will help minimize the stress so he can focus on healing. If you'd like to help by donating a meal (whether you want to drop it off or have it delivered)  please contact Brittany. We recommend using the Waitr app if you want the meal delivered from a local restaurant as Uber Eats is unavailable in Lafayette. On behalf of Robert & Enrique  we appreciate the love and support that has been shown over the past few weeks and appreciate your positive thoughts in the weeks to come.

Help Connie beat Colon Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-connie-beat-colon-cancer,1,KISSIMMEE,FL,Everyone who knows Connie knows that she is kind  caring  and very hard working. Happily married for 15 years and has a loving son of the age 22 and two beautiful girls ages 11 and 4. She would do anything for her family and anyone in need  but now she needs your help.In 2014 Connie was diagnosed with stage 3 Breast Cancer and now has been diagnosed with stage 3 Colon Cancer. It was all very unexpected. It all started because she experienced heavy bleeding from the rectum. Then her symptoms added on  such as loss of appetite  bloating  constipation and fatigue. In just 3 months she lost 16 pounds without dieting. On October 3  2018  she made an appointment with the doctor and figured out that she has Colon Cancer. Then on October 8  2018  is when she was diagnosed with stage 3 Colon Cancer. She is still waiting for the results for the MRI and CT Scan  that is when they will know if it spread in any other organs. She needs treatments which include chemo and radiation  which will follow with surgery to remove the tumor when it shrinks. As you know these treatments are very costly. This will affect her not being able to work and will put a lot of struggle and burden on not just her  but her husband and kids. She is worried she won't see all three of her kids growing up. Her 4 year old is diagnosed with Level 3 Autism. She is a very happy little girl who goes through some episodes but thats common within kids who have autism. With patience and love she needs a lot of help. She is not able to use the bathroom alone  and is not potty trained. She also does not speak  so you always have to be on top of her  and sometimes it can be hard to know what she wants or how she is feeling. Especially when she wants something  you have to pay close attention or guess what it is to help her through it. Her daughter goes to speech and occupational therapy. This new found disease will now effect her being able to take her to both therapies. Which now will be difficult because her husband will have to miss work and take their daughter to both therapies. With her not being able to work and him having to take days off it will affect their financial income. Connie loves and cares for her children deeply. Her oldest is away at college and hearing this news all over again has been a nightmare for him. Her 11 year old daughter will also be affected having to experience this all over again just like when she found out at the age of 7 that her mom had Breast Cancer in 2014. She would talk less about her feelings  and she seemed more down. She tried her best to be strong for her mom but it was all very hard for her. Now having to go through all of this again will be devastating for her and the family. A mother's bond is unbreakable and her love is unconditional. It's very hard to balance it all. She wants to be there for them and help them throughout their life  and be there for her husband as well. Please consider making a donation to help pay for all of these unexpected bills. They need your help and prayers so Connie can fight this Colon Cancer. Any donation would be greatly appreciated in helping this family.,2775,25000,4,11,29,715,6

My friend and amazing donor Amy Dorr was approved as my match a few weeks ago. I am fortunate to have the support of my wonderful family and friends in addition to Amy Dorr to get through this wonderful time.A little back story...several months ago I set up a face book page with a letter explaining my need for living donor. On April 30th Amy Dorr  did not hesitate to complete the paperwork at USCF to begin this process. Over the past few months  she has completed several tests  including blood tests  CAT scan  x-rays and psychological tests  including a trip to UCSF.  On September 17  she was approved to donate her left kidney :-)She is an amazing human being who I will always be grateful to have in my life!I am setting up this Go Fund Me in order to assist with the heavy financial aspect of all the non-medical issues attributed to the surgery.  Unfortunately  financial assistance for living organ donors  their families and recipient families are slim.Travel  lodging and meals are estimated to be nearly $10 000 for everyone involved. Everyone knows San Francisco is an expensive city to stay. For Amy  They will be staying at the Homewood Suites  which is a Hilton property  so if you would like to pool Hilton points  that would work too :-) Please email me if that is something you would like to do!Any amount  large or small  would be greatly appreciated!

Working and supervising as an RN/BSN in critical care units  emergency and operating rooms in many hospitals throughout the valley  as well as in the Maricopa County Jail System  she strategically planned very well for her future and life after retirement. As in most cases  no matter how strategically and specifically to the detail you plan for your future  life throws a curve ball and you’re suddenly faced with a situation you are just not prepared for.  Pastor Diane has never been the type of person to ask for anything  except in extreme and urgent situations  when help was critically necessary. Because of this unforeseen setback  she has been drained physically  mentally  and now financially  as she must pay weekly for the care she is receiving around the clock. Some examples of the care she requires includes a nurse registry  a live-in caregiver  IV infusion therapy  physical therapy and rehabilitation  food  medical equipment and supplies  etc. An illness like the one Pastor Diane has suffered can prove to be long lasting and expensive. As her Pastors  and as men and women of God  this is a time where we need to step in and assist as much as possible. We are standing in faith that her health will be restored to her  but until that time  we must also use every natural provision to assist in her healing and recovery process; therefore  I am establishing this Gofundme page to help offset some of the cost of care to help Pastor Diane in this great and overwhelming time of need. This is a time where we do not want to shut up our bowels of compassion  so that the LOVE of God may continue to dwell in us and flow through us!! So please  help me to help her by donating as soon as possible.  The first phase of treatment  with an approximate cost of $2000.00  has already begun. Remember  no gift is too large or too small. We will maximize whatever is donated  and believe God to multiply it! In conclusion  please  don’t take life for granted! You must know and understand that no matter who you are  what you’re doing  or how well you’ve planned  life as you know it today could change tomorrow. So let’s live  love and thank our Heavenly Father every single day for the very air we breathe. Love is a healer and is truly key in this hour! Blessings to you all and as always  I love you more!,1645,6000,20,27,37,112,6
Help Pay Natalie&apos;s Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/natalie-18-amp-autoimmune,0,WYLIE,TX,"About mid-July of this year  I was rushed to ER with kidney stones. I ended up going home the same night after passing it  but my mother and I were both very concerned at the fact I had them in the first place. Especially  at the age of eighteen. From there  we took a look at all of my previous ER excursions from prior years and realized something wasn't adding up. We went to my pediatrician  who had been seeing me since I was a baby  and she agreed something was off. But  after some lab tests that resulted in a \Maybe\"" for having lupus and an anxiety attack in my pediatrician's office  I was recommended to get psychiatric help and we were passed along to a rheumatologist who specialized in lupus. It took us over month to get in for an appointment and what the rheumatologist told us was not helpful. I was told that I didn't have lupus  nothing was wrong with me  it was all in my head  and was told to \""seek out psychiatric help\"". Again.           This was more than frustrating. Because  clearly  I had imagined having the excruciating pain and passing a kidney stone. Our chiropractor had actually been an amazing help during this time. He was the one who found the kidney stone (we had thought I'd thrown out my back)  and had done my initial food allergy testing. We've known him for years  and he has yet to steer us wrong. So  he suggested we run a few labs and blood tests to see what's up. We ran an autoimmune panel. After a painfully long three weeks  we returned to his office when he got the results. Only to see that I registered positive for almost every single autoimmune disease on the panel. Cue us running another lab to see if we could discover anything behind it.         There was another set of agonizingly long three weeks. Then  when my chiropractor got the results  they were overwhelming enough that he had to wait to call the doctor at the head of Cyrex labs to explain them. At that point  I triggered positive for so many things that he could no longer help us. The moment he told me  I had to fight a break down. I was upset and feeling lost. My mom has been my rock during this time. I don't know what I would do without her.          Through various friends  and even at the recommendation of the doctor at the head of Cyrex labs  we finally had found a doctor: Dr. Erin Van Veldhuizen She was a functional medicine professional and it would be another another month before we could see her. I was so defeated and upset that I didn't care anymore. I just said  \""Whatever.\"" So  Mom made the appointment  and put us on the cancellation list as well. What happened next was a God thing  I swear.          Two hours after my mom made the appointment  she received a call from the office's secretary who told her there had been a cancellation two days from then. We got in and the things we discussed were overwhelming. Dr. Van Veldhuizen seemed fascinated by me being so young and having all these odd things wrong with me. It was actually relieving to have someone tell me that these symptoms weren't normal. My mom actually stopped her and asked  \""So  we're not crazy?\""          I started crying when Dr. Van Veldhuizen said  \""No  of course not. These symptoms aren't normal.\""            All of the anxiety  dietary issues  hormone imbalances  migraines  joint pain - all real  all wrong. And those are just the tip of the iceberg.           The first visit was really just to talk and do a few tests in office. Right away  Dr. Van Veldhuizen was able to tell me that something wasn't just physically wrong with me  but it was severely affecting me neurologically. So  we ran some more tests - three or four blood tests  a saliva test  a saliva-based genetics test  a spinal x-ray  and several in-office neurological tests consisting of: an impact test  a RightEye test (neurological eye-function test)  and a balance test. It was a very long day. We had arrived at the doctor's office at 11am  and by the time we got home from the x-ray  it was probably about six o'clock.          After that  we had to wait another long three weeks for the results. We went back this most recent Friday. (10/5/2018) What we heard wasn't great  but it was answers.         We learned that I don't have autoimmune disease yet  and that I'm not predisposed to cancer (Thank You God!!!).  My estrogen and testosterone levels are through the roof - about ten times the high end of the normal amount. We also learned that my hormones are completely and utterly screwed up in addition to my having PCOS (Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome) and it just gets worse. I'm extremely deficient in all sorts things: Vitamin B  Vitamin D  digestive enzymes  Iron (but not the kind that is normally tested for)   and neurotransmitters (as a result of the other deficiencies). I actually have cholesterol that is too low - which is bad because good cholesterol works as a protective agent in the body.            I was diagnosed with a Self-Attack Autoimmune Response. Which is probably about as horrible as it sounds. My body is basically overreacting to everything I put in it  and on it.             That isn't the bad news  however. The bad news is that I'm predisposed to Alzheimer's  Parkinson's  and MS (Multiple Sclerosis).  I actually already have a very high count of the Myelin Basic Protein in my system. Which is what can cause MS  especially for someone with a predisposition. So  this is where everything changes. That is Dr. Van Veldhuizen's biggest concern.              We're currently running more allergy tests and taking large steps to prevent it. Dr. Van Veldhuizen is actually relieved we caught it this early. But  this is where the GoFundMe comes into play. Because Dr. Van Veldhuizen has a cash only practice  none of this is covered by our insurance. In addition  some of this is consider \""not medically necessary\"" by the insurance.              The supplements alone are $710 a month. They would like me to have a minimum three IV doses of glutathione which are $395 each (so for all three $1 185). They also want me to have an Array 11 Chemical Immune Reactivity Screen which is $765. On top of weekly neurotherapy visits which have not yet received a price for. Past expenses from seeing Dr. Van Veldhuizen total to $2 627  not including two other labs we had done beforehand that totaled to about $1 000.                The positive side is  that I am not permanently going to be on supplements. But  I will be on them for some time.               I've always hated to be the person to ask for financial help  but this time  I have to. Even the smallest donation is appreciated! If you can't donate  I would appreciate it wholeheartedly if you would just keep me in your prayers!With much love and wishing you many blessings Natalie Van Hecke""",300,15000,7,2,10,132,6

Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/hgpcvg-cancer-fund,0,BOYNTONBEACH,FL,I come again to ask for help just for the next 2 months. As most of you know I have cancer  which is spreading through my lymphatic system. I took a medical leave of absence from August 20th to October 20th  and at the time was hopeful that I would have had chemo administered and my second primary left lung cancer excised. As paperwork goes I have not even started my chemo as yet and it's October 8th. While I have been lucky enough to have been chosen to start the Keytruda immuno Therapy Program  the comical errors of the shuffling of paperwork it requires to get me on this have failed for treatment to happen swiftly. I went ahead and visited my place of employment to let them know that I would be more than happy to come back to work on October 20th but was not sure if I could give them 100% right off the bat  as I wasn't sure how the chemo would allow me to react or how healthy I would be to be able to work an 8 hour day  as hard as I do work. When letting my bosses know all the information that most of you know she had asked me to please take this time to get myself better see how I react to the chemo and to please come back after my lung operation  which at this point in time I am not sure when that will be. She avidly assured me that my position would be held until I am better she just wants me to concentrate on saving my life. What a commendable boss who will save my position to allow me to get my health back in top shape. However  that leaves me wondering how am I going to pay November and December's rent.So here I am again humbly asking for help to allow me to go through this chemo treatment which MAY by the way take care of the left lung  as well as the right lung  the right lung is the culprit that has metastasized which gave me two bumps on top of my head that were already surgically removed which has also stricken both of my parotid glands on either side of my face  1 of which I've already had removed on the left and the other one  on the right   is starting to grow. I am praying that I get to start Keytruda this Thursday in hopes that we can get this monster growing inside of me under control.The majority of my life I have been very independent  as well as a strong single mother. It is not easy for me to ask for help  but  I find it easier to ask than wonder what the alternative might bring if I cannot keep my home  and would have to rely upon my children to house me. Although I know any one of them would be willing to take me in.... I like my little spot in the world  I am comfortable here  I've made it my own.  My landlord is more than happy to help me and work with me on any issues I may have regarding monies owed to him. I do not want to cause him a financial hardship and I have told him time and again if it ever gets to the point to where you just can't handle me not having money for you please let me know and I will bow out gracefully  knowing that at any time he could fill this house with anybody else. He has told me he does not want anybody else in here he wants me to be able to stay here we are comfortable with one another our children know each other and we have great great respect for each other. That's hard to find in landlords in South Florida. While I'm very thankful to have a job being held for me as well as pretty much knowing that I'll always be able to lay my head in my own home I am humbled and wondering how I'm going to pay for rent in November and December. So again I'm putting it public and asking for whatever help that you can give just to pay my rent!  I know God will take care of the rest as he always had in my life. If there's anything that you need to know in reference to my condition I'll be an open book. I just want to win this fight and be here for my children  you see back in April my two oldest children lost their father. What a devastating loss for our family  but him losing his life is the biggest reason I fight so hard to save mine. I have to believe that God does not want me to expire and leave all of my children motherless as well as the two that are left fatherless from his passing. No donation is too small no prayer is too small if you can't donate fine I'm good with that just continue to keep me in your prayers  I'm going to fight the good fight all the way through this and I vow to kick Cancer's ASS!!!,1236,1860,9,66,17,150,6

Dan is currently still in the ICU and will be at the hospital for at least another week. Dan's recovery could be anywhere from 6 months to one year. Any help will go to Dan's hospital bills and recovery. Thank you,1975,15000,12,13,40,268,6

He is one of three children raise by a single mother. She does not have a steady job and is unable to continue working now that she has to care for him. His road to recovery will be very difficult  and long. He will have to learn how to use a wheelchair and walk one day again with the use of prosthetic limbs. He will also need psychological trauma intervention and special accessible transportation to bring his wheelchair inside a van and inside his home. His doctors have advised that he will also need to have surgery for his broken hips in order to place titanium plates to rebuild them.Eduardo  is only 25 years of age and has only his mother to care for him. Unfortunately  his mother does not have health care coverage or disability benefits that so many of us take for granted. Costs for his rehab  medical  and family expenses will continue to pile up.

Stand by Eli,https://www.gofundme.com/yw39eg-stand-by-eli,7,TARZANA,CA,Hello Please take the time to read the story below on Eli. I have met this boy personally and have interacted with him on several occasions and I hold him and his family very near and dear to my heart. As a way to support him in his quest for treatment and services  we will be setting up a matching fundraiser with the Learning and Behavioral Center  LLC and the A.L.L. Campaign.For every donation that is made  we will match that amount and contribute it to his fundraiser up to $5 000.Eli is a sweet and pure soul and I look forward to seeing him continue to play with his parents and brother to keep a beautiful smile on his face. Eli was born in the summer of 2014 and developed like a typical newborn- smiling  cooing  sleeping  and eating. He loved getting tickled with his mommy’s soft hair and getting hugs and kisses from his family. At his six-month check up  we noticed that he was struggling to roll over  reach for toys and babble (make sounds). Eli continued to struggle with reaching his milestones at every check up. In November of 2017  after months of unanswered questions and tests  Eli was diagnosed with a genetic mutation on IRF2BPL (a currently nameless and rare disease). A geneticist explained that this rare neurodegenerative disorder had no treatment options or cure and would leave Eli a silent prisoner in a lifeless body. Our lives were shattered! Every doctor we visited said the same thing  “We don’t know anything about this disease. There just isn’t enough information. There is nothing we can do for him  there is no cure”.Will You Stand By Eli?Eli is a very energetic and playful kid. He loves Superheroes! His favorite characters are the P.J.Masks and he loves to run around the house imitating them. Eli is the most loving and pure child. He LOVES hugs and kisses and asks for them frequently. He loves to love! To know Eli is to know kindness  happiness  unconditional love and joy for life.The world needs kids like Eli. We are fighting to allow his personality and soul to shine and for him not to become a prisoner of his body.The Clock is Ticking! Fund the cure today!To date  the only support we have is through the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) at Harvard. The UDN and NIH are funding limited research on decoding the gene and learning it’s function in the body. Very little is known about this gene  how it works  where in the body it functions and why it may be the cause of all these symptoms. Our challenge is to find answers. Without our funding  the research will end here. We have made agreements with 2 world renowned children’s hospitals to find answers fast! Both Texas Children’s Hospital and Nationwide Children’s hospitals are going through great efforts to find answers. They are very optimistic that they will find a treatment  and hopefully a cure for Eli. This research may also shine a light on other neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer’s and ALS to name a few. The possibilities are endless.We can only do this with your help and generous donations. Every time Eli falls  stumbles  or takes too long to get his words out  our hearts drop! We wonder if the disease is taking over. We need to find a cure before his body stops working. Once he loses skills  we are not sure if we can get them back. Please help us save him by donating today!To fund these 2 research projects  we need to raise $900 000 for the first phase of research at both institutes. The second phase of the research will involve testing gene therapy and is expected to cost anywhere from $3 to $5 million dollars. Eli is almost 4 years old  and the average age of onset of the neurodegenerative symptoms has been between 5 and 7 years of age. Your donation and generosity is desperately needed now.

I found out my insurance would not cover it (despite saying it does on a case-by-case basis)  and I was not approved for any medical credit programs. I do plan on saving up as much as I can on my own  but I am a full-time student and can only work so many hours a week. Right now  I have to bind for 12 or more hours a day  far more than what is healthy. I really hate to ask for money like this  but I’m desperate at this point.,166,4000,8,4,5,49,6

Please help Ro-zee!,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-rozee,2,UPPERBLACKEDDY,PA,"Please consider helping our friend Ro-zee (aka: The Densche) who was hit severely several weeks ago with the remnants of Gordon.  Although the Delaware River did not flood this time  every tributary and stream that feeds into the river and empties the storm water from the area was slammed  water flying off the hill like a trainwreck.  Some 5-6 inches of rain fell in less than an hour… and the picture shows the result.  She needs your immediate help to pay for the work required to get her access to her home. This will be at least $6 000. In a period of about 10 minutes from when the stream breached a bridge and a 12-foot drop from the normal stream bed to over banks some 12-14 feet high  it plowed through a house  pushed an SUV some 23 feet …and just shy of being pushed into the stream  managed to be moved.  It ripped through her driveway  pulled a 65-year old tree over  and with it  her car port and broke her driveway literally in half  leaving two cars dangling on the edge of what remained. It rushed through her basement and left 3-4-inches of mud and debris in her bottom floor  damaged her heater  hot water heater and washer downstairs.  In the back of the property  it tore a chunk of her property away… but not before leaving piles of debris  trees  garbage and wood throughout her property  which now needs to be cleaned up.But . the biggest damage is the middle section of her driveway – the only access to her home – which has been literally broken in half.  For anyone who is familiar  flood insurance does NOT cover land – only structures.  The stream bank stone wall needs to be rebuilt…on a large scale  which will cost thousands.  The front of the drive needs to be filled  as there is now a 4-foot drop from the road level into her driveway – where the water flew down the hill  over the road and public bridge at the end of her property  and eroded her drive creating an impassable and dangerous gully. (See the picture.) Because the river did not flood  this affected a targeted number of properties…and not the entire river communities as it has in the past when FEMA responded. As a result  a normal threshold that would enable FEMA to assist is NOT on site  and so FEMA is not helping individual homeowners.  In addition  although the governor declared disaster areas in large pockets across the state of PA  the areas hit are not being assisted by volunteer groups or even PEMA  as usually happens after floods that affect entire contiguous areas.  Bottom line is  she's left on her own with virtually no assistance.What's crucial to know is that she lives in a 235 year old home.  The surrounding properties and her home comprise the oldest section in the area.  Prior to the floods of 2004  5 and 6… the only severe flood in relatively recent times was in 1955.  From 1999 to 2003  some 7 new developments were built in the valley that feeds directly into her stream.  This is an area of roughly 30 square miles.  Her stream is the ONLY outlet for this entire region.  Trees have been cut  farms have been reappropriated  roads  homes  driveways and GRASS have replaced what was once wooded area and controlled open space.  There is no doubt that the frequency of flooding and volume of water is not only due to weather changes  but to rampant  uncontrolled building.  And permitting for development continues to be granted without effective control of this extreme water volume. There is currently yet ANOTHER development being put in as we speak… the runoff of which will flow directly into a tributary of this stream.  So  when people think  \Gee…if it floods this often  why build there?\""  keep in mind that – some 250 years ago  if there had been the same frequency of flooding then as there is now  they WOULD NOT HAVE BUILT HERE.The rebuilding of her property to keep her house safe (as well as restoring the access to her home)  is going to cost several thousand dollars.  The only contribution the local developer (who was granted permits for his multiple profitable developments) is making to this reparation …is more water.Please help and offer whatever you can!""",605,5000,25,12,9,17,6

All of the surgeries and treatments have led them to the latest trial at Ohio State University  called the BXQ-350 cancer trial  which is a five week trial for which they will have to go back and forth from home to participate. As you can imagine  this will come with some extra financial burdens due to costs of the extensive traveling they will have to do (we don't want them to have to try and fly standby because of the unpredictability that comes along with that)and all of the unexpected costs that seem to add up in times like this. We would like  to get them at least a portion of the funds as soon as possible due to the trial potentially starting next Monday  October 15th.  We are hoping this reaches as many of the Solberg's friends and members of their extended Navy family as possible  so please pass this information on to anyone you know that has been so lucky to be a part of their lives in some way.,32577,100000,24,33,181,398,6
Help for Karen Oller,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-karen-oller,7,LACANADAFLINTRIDGE,CA,This is my dear friend Avy Summerlind  who many of you might know by the name of Karen Oller.  Avy  as she prefers to be called  has been sick for almost 20 years.  She suffers from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue and pain)  Dysautonomia (a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system)  and a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos which causes severe joint pain.  Despite managing these symptoms for many years  she was able to work  write and perfom songs  and even create DIY fundraisers at her home to raise money for numerous nonprofits.  For years she did not want to admit that she was ill  and she pushed through it  which is why some of you may not even know she was sick when you knew her.  In 2008  her illnesses became extremely debilitating and she became disabled in 2010.  She could no longer work and needed full-time caregiving  living with relatives.  At this point  she has nodules on her lungs and a growth on her spine.  She is now homebound.  She can't drive and uses a wheelchair for many excursions (when she is able to go out  which is rare).   She has tried countless remedies  doctors  regimes  and medications over the years  both Eastern and Western philosophies.  She even changed her name as a way of visualizing her ideal life  hoping for any kind of improvement.  Nothing has helped for very long because her body is so sensitive to change.  There is a doctor in Mountain View  CA who is a specialist in the field and this is Avy's best hope of improving.  She is flew there recently for an appointment but she does not have the funds to run the necessary extensive lab tests.  The tests cost $6 000.  If you are inclined to help my dear friend  who in her life has done so much to help others  we would be so appreciative for anything you can offer.,5243,6000,42,87,46,18,6

Craig Snell Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/craig-snell-recovery-fund,7,DILLSBURG,PA,Kerry and Craig need our help and support.Craig Snell had a bilateral pontine stroke and was diagnosed with locked-in syndrome. Over the past 2 1/2 years  Craig has been making remarkable improvements from what was supposed to be a diagnosis of being locked in for a lifetime. Last year our employer  Susquehanna Township School District  switched insurance providers from Capital Blue Cross to Highmark.  This change has resulted in Craig's wife  Kerry  spending countless hours on the phone trying to get treatment approved for her husband.Craig is being treated by a neurologist and a physical therapist  both of whom have completed several assessments and reported that Craig is making improvements in every area but Highmark continues to deny physical therapy saying they don’t see any clinical improvement. The information that is being sent from the physical therapist and neurologist is being reviewed by a doctor of internal medicine.Each time Craig’s claim for physical therapy is denied by Highmark  Kerry files an appeal  which continues to be denied based on the claim that he is not making clinical improvements—contrary to what is in the medial report from both the physical therapist and neurologist.If Highmark would simply pay for 30 visits of physical therapy  the supplemental insurance company would cover the remaining physical therapy visits.The physical therapist who is working with Craig has seen such an improvement in his condition and is not only willing to work with him on a pro bono basis until the insurance mess is figured out  but is also scheduling his physical therapy visits so that he may use part of his personal lunch break to treat Craig. Who would give up personal time if treatment wasn't working? Until this mess is figured out  the money used from this campaign will help Kerry pay for the therapy and expenses that she has incurred taking care of her husband.Juliana Mattera wrote a story about this right after it happened.

In addition to caring for Leonel full time  Gisela is a great and kind human being who strives to change our world to make it better and more compassionate  especially for children. She has worked with young people for her whole life. I remember her telling me a story of her taking in a young boy who lived on the streets of Buenos Aires and after serving him spaghetti he told her he didn’t really like pasta.  She smiled and found out what he liked to eat. :)She was a magical storyteller for children to save money and then worked her way through college  receiving a degree in psychology. Gisela taught a compassionate way of relating to babies called RIE. She worked as a parenting teacher at a center that teaches non-violent communication to families. Now with her Masters degree Gisela works with our most vulnerable population of women and children who are suffering greatly.A small donation from many people would be a huge show of support and love for this amazing giver of care and love to Leonel. I know it will lift her during this extremely stressful and challenging time.  Everything is appreciated so very deeply.Update: Queridos amigos  Leonel falleció anoche con mucha tranquilidad acompañando por su amor  Gisela  que lo cuidó hasta el último momento. Gisela está segura que él sabía cuánto lo querían y apoyaban todos y ella también ha sentido el apoyo muy fuerte de esta comunidad. Cuando se hagan planes para despedirlo lo vamos a postear aquí. Gracias por continuar apoyándolos. Leonel ha estado luchando con todas sus fuerzas contra la Leucemia por más de dos años. Ha sido un paciente dedicado  con un sentido del humor y un carisma inquebrantable a pesar de los constantes tratamientos y procedimientos médicos  de las numerosas medicinas que debe tomar cada día y del trasplante de médula que le hicieron. Desafortunadamente su salud ha empeorado al punto que ahora lucha por su vida.Por su parte Gisela  esposa de Leonel y el amor de su vida  se ha dedicado en cuerpo y alma a cuidarlo y ser el soporte económico de la familia. Gisela es una persona excepcional  bondadosa y en busca de hacer este mundo mejor  especialmente para los niños. Ha trabajado con jóvenes y niños toda su vida. La recuerdo contándome una historia de cuando vivía en Buenos Aires  encontró un niño viviendo en la calle y decidió llevarle un delicioso espagueti para que comiera  el niño le dijo que no le gustaba la pasta. Gisela sonrió y averiguó que era lo que realmente le gustaba comer y se lo llevó.Gisela trabajó durante su juventud como cuenta cuentos para niños  para ahorrar algo de dinero. Tiempo después fue a la Universidad para obtener un grado en psicología. En sus inicios  Gisela enseñó a padres y maestros el Método RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers) una metodología diseñada para la crianza de niños independientes y seguros de si mismos.

Medical help,https://www.gofundme.com/zfrquq-medical-help,1,CHATTANOOGA,TN,Imagine for a minute that you're 26years old and for the 3rd time in your life you've been diagnosed with cancer again. Ovarian cancer… again! That is what my friend is going through right now. She suited up and prepared herself for another battle. Shortly after she began chemo  as if fighting ovarian cancer for the third time weren’t enough  the doctors discovered a tumor in her liver. Unfortunately  the surgery for removing the tumor is dangerous and cannot be removed until she successfully completes chemo for the ovarian cancer.Unfortunately she’s missed a lot of work because of the side-effects associated with chemo and was forced to take a medical leave. Consequently  her health insurance is no longer valid because she has dropped below half time. Not only has she lost her insurance  but has also lost her only source of income. Which means she can no longer afford her chemotherapy treatments  she cannot pay her bills and is at risk of losing her home.She has appealed her health insurance  she has requested Medicaid  she applied for disability. All which takes time; a luxury she does not have. Throughout all of this  she has not lost faith that God will see her through all of this. She’s a fighter. Cancer is a bully out to destroy one of the most determined  giving and caring people I have ever known. During her second diagnosis  she completed her degree at the University of Central Florida. I know people who wouldn’t get out of bed for less. But not her. She pressed on. This is the title fight for her life. A life she deserves to live to the very fullest. Don’t let cancer win. Please help her find her way to victory. Donate anything you can: $1  $5  $10. Every bit helps. Please share as well.,165,10000,8,2,7,70,6

F**k Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/pcfn3d-fk-cancer,1,LAPORTE,PA,Hi guys! As some of you may already know my mom  Shauna  was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of 2014  but after her last treatment in March of 2015 she was thought to be in the clear.  Unfortunately  she went into the hospital Wednesday  September 22nd with severe leg pain  only to find out that the cancer was back  but in her bones this time. She was placed in surgery on Friday for her hip and discharged over the weekend. After her first oncologist appointment October 2nd  she learned that the breast cancer had metastasized to her bones  causing a stage 4 diagnosis  almost exactly four years later. She is in good spirits and mentally stronger than ever  but physically she is recovering from her surgery  making work  along with many of things  impossible right now. To add to this  she came home from the hospital only to realize someone had stolen her wallet while she was there  with her last few hundred dollars in it. Yes  we have tried very  very hard to find it  but have sadly had zero luck. Right now her primary financial concerns are the care and well being of my brother and bills (including any hospital bills she will be responsible for). Any dollar amount you can give will be extremely appreciated. To take some of the weight off of her shoulders would mean everything to her  me  and my brothers. Our mom is one of the most caring  loving  amazing women out there. Not only is she a great mom  she's a loving sister  daughter  and friend to anyone who needs her. She'd do anything for anyone if she could and she deserves any help you can give.  With that being said  F**K CANCER.,1470,1500,6,98,24,360,6
Wyatt Hernandez  Lymphatic surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/wyatt-hernandez-lymphatic-surgery,9,CHICKASHA,OK,The Hernandez family has been through a lot.  Being a military (Coast Guard) family with four boys (2-10) means money is tight is the best of times. This is their second son to have a major medical emergency this year. Please find it in your heart to help. Even a small amount will help!! If you can’t donate  please share! From Wyatt’s mother Haley: Our sweet Wyatt was born with a Lymphatic Malformation  7 years ago. Since Wyatt was a baby  he has had 3 lymphatic malformation flare ups so far. We sought medical help when Wyatt was a baby only to feel abandoned and hopeless as his condition “wasn’t life threatening” and “was only cosmetic”. At the time  the doctors diagnosed Wyatt with A fatty tissue buildup; however we have come to learn that what he in fact has is essentially a malformation of blood vessels that will be difficult and dangerous to treat.  The ER doctors at Driscoll children’s hospital in Corpus Christi  Texas turned Us away without answers  without hope and left us with fear and anxiety as we continued to watch Wyatts neck swell. I have tried to keep these things close to my heart  and not to grumble or complain to others but it is difficult to see your child in pain and be unable to help them. Finally  we found a doctor at Ear  Nose and Throat associates in Corpus Christi that was knowledgeable about Vascular Malformations but Wyatt’s case and condition was too involved for even him.  The doctor said even if he attempted to remove the troubled area  we would only see it fill back up with tissue and fluid. This physician recommended Wyatt be sent out of State to OU Children’s Hospital for surgery to remove the malformation  Due to the location of the malformation  the close proximity to his main artery in his neck and other factors Wyatt needs to be in a hospital with support care in place. He will have to stay over night at minimum and will need a drain placed as well.  Wyatt has also been diagnosed with a secondary conditioned called Low Von Willie Brand Factor  Low Von Willie Brand Factor is a bleeding disorder that affects the bloods ability to clot normally. finally putting a name to the issues he has suffered with since birth and giving us the answer as to WHY his lymph node continues to have flare ups. It is RARE for children OVER 4 to have lymphatic malformation flare ups  and to further complicate things children who DO have a flare up over the age of 4 will likely have to have surgery to remove the growth because it will not go away on its own. Over the past 10 days  Wyatt has had several medical procedures to try and diagnose the issues he is having. Ultrasounds  C-t scabs  blood work... etc.... It all started at school  his neck swelled to the size of a golf ball within 45 minutes and continued to grow over the next several days to the size of a softballTo all those who know and love Wyatt  it is hard to see him hurting. This child always presents a positive and grateful attitude  noting how others he has met on his journey have it worse than he does (which has to be one of the most remarkable things about this sweet young man-always thinking of others!) He is beyond thankful for his family  friends  and the prayers that they lift up on his behalf. He is amazing!!!I am guilty of reassuring Wyatt that things will get better  taking his blessing and cheerfulness and refusing to recognize the REAL picture. I realize now that behind that smiley face I see when I am with him  Wyatt is truly in pain but doesn’t want to “bother” me or anyone else with his suffering. Both Wyatt and I cry in the quiet  in the shadows so that you won’t see our pain.Here’s the reason for the GoFundMe request. Wyatt has at least 2 to 3 visits out of state coming up for his surgery and the consultations leading up to the surgery/ after wards. So I am asking for your support for Wyatt. You can pledge a monthly amount  or a one-time gift  any size that God leads you to. Gofundme.com will get 5% of what you send  but the rest will go to our family as we endure this journey together. It will help supplement our travel out of state for his doctor appointments  hospitalizations and medical expenses. While my prayer is and still will be a complete eradication of his pain and this malformation  I know that this is all God’s plan for Wyatt and our family.,2075,2500,5,83,26,448,6

"Kerala, India  Flooding Disaster",https://www.gofundme.com/olog-india-flooding,2,STAMFORD,CT,Two of our Sister's families at Our Lady of Grace have been affected by two weeks of horrible rain storms back in August.  Although they have never asked for anyone to help them  we as a family at OLOG want to help their families. The international media has called it the worst flood of the century in the region. After more than two weeks of relentless rain  Kerala  a state at the southern tip of India  known internationally for its scenic green landscapes  touristic spots and backwaters  is left with over 1 million people in relief camps and close to 400 reported dead.  The number of casualties is expected to be much higher  as many areas still remain inaccessible.  The total destruction of roads  bridges and railway systems has made it almost impossible to reach the victims with food  clean water and other essentials.Here is a quote from one of our sisters:“In August  I traveled home to visit my family after a long time. I was desperate to get home because in March this year my mother was diagnosed with cancer and I just wanted to be with her. Being a kindergarten teacher and studying—I am working towards a degree in early childhood development—it’s difficult for me to travel. It is already hard enough being so far away  but knowing my mom was sick made it even harder. On August 16th  the day I was supposed to return to the US  disaster struck. I remember the water coming into my family home. It is only one story  so there was nowhere for us to go. The water came in and took everything away from us. It was a very  very sad tragedy. The water in my house was up to my neck. My brother took me on his shoulders and carried me to a boat that took me to the convent that was on higher ground. It took three hours. My mother and father were taken to my sister’s house. I just remember people everywhere  searching for a way out  heartbroken to  leave their homes.”,2075,25000,25,8,23,46,6
Release That Weight - The Next Step,https://www.gofundme.com/release-that-weight-the-next-step,0,SAINTLOUIS,MO,Dear Friends On August 29  2016  I took the first step on a journey that would forever change my life. As it so happens  that first step…was onto a scale.Today  I start preparing for the next part of that journey and I will admit something that is ALWAYS hard for me to admit: I need your help.On January 3  2019 I will undergo a surgery called a “Belt Lipectomy ” also known as a circumferential body lift. Now  if you’re like me  you’re asking the person sitting next to you “What in the hell is a belt lipectomy?” Let me tell you:After you lose a great amount of weight  let’s call it…hmm…375 pounds  you have a lot of extra skin in different areas of your body. The neck  the arms  the thighs  the chest  etc. But for me  the area that has the most extra skin is my midsection. Essentially  you literally work your butt off but then have a daily reminder of who you used to be and it’s called your apron (By the way…How awful is that?). It’s called your apron because it hangs below your stomach and waist and covers various parts of your lower half. I affectionately call it: My Bubble.Now  I’ll admit that I have been very lucky when it comes to extra skin. I don’t have nearly as much as any of my doctors expected in a lot of areas. But  My Bubble is prevalent and drives me crazy every day because no matter what I do  no matter what I eat  no matter how much I work out  it’s not going anywhere without this surgery. And every day  it’s a reminder of the pain  the depression  and the hate that I used to carry with me 24/7. Even though I know it’s not true  I feel eyes go directly to that Bubble. In my mind  it’s the first thing people see. Those that love me tell me I’m crazy  and I most definitely am. But  the problem is…when I stand in a mirror  it’s the first place my eyes go. And so  after lots of thought  lots of talk with doctors  friends  loved ones  and people who have undergone this procedure in the past  I decided…IT HAS TO GO.It’s time to move on! And my move on date is officially scheduled for January 3  2019. Right here in St. Louis  I’ll undergo surgery to remove My Bubble and have an even fresher  greater perspective on life. A very good friend told me  “You’ve worked so hard and this is finally something 100% out of your control. You deserve to move on.” I love thinking of this procedure in that way.The problem is…it’s expensive. The other problem is…insurance considers it an elective surgery. Now  in my mind  it’s far from elective. Not only will it help me move forward in terms of mental self-image  but it will make exercise much easier  it will cause clothes to fit much better  and it will make daily activities even easier than they already are. For me  those are the things getting me most excited for my operation date.A number of amazing supporters in my life have already made contributions and I’m now taking it to my social media friends and family and asking you to assist me in whatever way you can. And please know that  if you can’t or you don’t feel comfortable doing so  I 100% understand. I simply ask you to send good thoughts and positive vibes. For those who do want to give…Thank you for truly becoming a part of my journey of acceptance  healthier living  and release. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.The total bill for the surgery and all that it entails is $23 000. As I mentioned before  I already have a bit raised and am putting away as much money as I comfortably can to add to the pot as well. So  I’m setting a goal of $12 500 to get me as close as possible to that final price tag. Anything you can give is appreciated more than I will ever be able to express.Thank you so much for considering helping me out on the final stage of this exciting adventure! Having you by my side is truly reward enough  but the idea of finding some more self-love and acceptance…that’s pretty damn enticing. Much love and as always…RELEASE THAT WEIGHT!!!Andrew#releasethatweight#acceptance#loveyourself#upnextMy Story:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4645741983932&set=a.3995941499326&type=3&theater,10100,12500,16,81,110,450,6

Cambodian family losing home,https://www.gofundme.com/cambodian-family-losing-home,2,VALLEYSPRINGS,CA,A lot of you are familiar with the amazing work of this Cambodian family  who over the past six years has arranged for more than three-dozen children living in poverty-stricken shantytowns to attend school. They got one little boy begging on the streets to raise money for his mom with AIDS off the streets and into school  and medical and nutritional support for his mom. You can see her amazing transformation in the pictures below.  They chose to live in poverty themselves  so they could use whatever help they received to tirelessly labor to help these children and orphans  and even took in three into their own home. Now they are the ones who are in great need of help. Pastor Ponlok Hor and his wife  Esther  rented a run-down home in 2016 and turned it into a refuge  offering free English classes  food and clothing giveaways  and a safe and clean after-school place for homework and fellowship. With the help of a small group of people in California  they cleaned and painted it and turned the bottom part of the home into a church  reaching out to their poor neighbors and offering help and hope to a people that could not find it anywhere else. Now  because of the rapidly changing situation in Sihanoukville  they are losing that home  which they share with their own young son and the three poverty-stricken children they took in  in December.BEFOREAFTEROver the past couple of years  Chinese investors have poured into Sihanoukville  sending rental prices skyrocketing. It’s a boom that reaches only those directly involved in the casinos and other investments; Cambodians  already poor  have been not only shut out of the prosperity but are being priced out of their homes as Chinese families pour in to manage their investments. With the lease running out  the Hor family’s rent is going from $500 a month to an astonishing $12 000. We are hoping to raise $2 500 to enable them to find a new home so they can keep working with the poor in their community. Every week they offer free English classes to give the students a better chance of finding work in such a difficult economy. Every Christmas  they invite hundreds of children in for a meal and gifts of clothing and supplies like soap  toothpaste and vitamins. They regularly hold food and clothing giveaways  give regular support to a few widows and if someone falls sick  they take them to the hospital. The children they took in had no parents and lived with grandparents in shanties with no hope of school  and they love them like their own son  Joseph.Any help you can give  no matter the size or even just sharing this  know that you’re not just helping the Hor family. You’re investing in the lives of countless needy  and in the very future of Cambodia for generations to come.If you have any questions or would like any more information  please do not hesitate to ask. This family is grateful beyond words for all the help you have offered over the years and any help at all you can offer now. Thank you and God bless!,360,2500,9,14,5,45,6

Devastation from IGA Nephropathy,https://www.gofundme.com/devastation-from-iga-nephropathy,4,ISSAQUAH,WA,After a visit to the emergency room for a severe headache the events for this young father turned very quickly. After an uncontrollable high blood pressure and obvious kidney damage the road was looking very dark for this one income family. After many tests and weeks in the intensive care unit the answer was finally found that he suffers from a condition called IGA Nephropathy and his kidneys were so badly damaged that they are only working up to 7% of that of a normal kidney function. The future of being on dialysis and waiting for a kidney transplant is disheartening. At this point with medical bills rolling in daily and the sole provider as a roofer for this family not able to work it has become a devastating month for this young family. I have hope in generous people stepping to support a family in need to keep them afloat during this time. Any gift will be extremely helpful and appreciated.,1135,15000,7,8,24,289,6

Due to the size and position of the tumor  the doctors are not confident they will be able to remove it surgically and plan to start chemo and radiation in hopes of shrinking the tumor enough that they can later remove it.  Sheridan is a stay at home Mom to Carter (13) and  Sawyer (8)  and sings in her Church’s worship band.  She is a remarkable woman who lives her life for her husband  Daniel  and their 2 boys. The next several months will require a tremendous amount of financial and emotional support as Sherry travels to and from Seattle for treatment. Daniel will need to take quite a bitof time off of work  and they will need to find childcare for Carter and Sawyer—all on top of astromomical medical bills.

Jeremiah&apos;s  Insurance let down,https://www.gofundme.com/68ezqhc,7,AUGUSTA,ME,Dear Friends and Family  On July 15th  life as I knew it got turned upside-down when I was diagnosed with an acute form of Leukemia known as Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML). This diagnosis came while I was travelling around Europe and was certainly not the ending I had in mind for my European journey. For five weeks I received in patient care at the Royal Bristol Infirmary in Bristol  England. The Leukemia caused me to have a bleed in the brain and behind the retina of my eyes. My physician told me if I had waited another day to seek medical help  I could have died. Once my platelet count was high enough and remained stable  I was able to receive outpatient care and stayed in an apartment while receiving treatment. While in England  I was fortunate to have the physical support of my foster mother  Susan and my brother  Micah along with the emotional support of many of you.            I have worked hard  I have been blessed with supportive mentors  and at 27 years old was proud of the life I had built. Life has always thrown me obstacles  but I have refused to be defeated and have always chosen gratitude instead. Leukemia is my new obstacle.   I have received one of the bills for my care in the United Kingdom  and as you can imagine five weeks of bone marrow biopsies  central lines  daily blood replacements and chemo has created a very large bill. I felt I was being responsible by being covered by multiple insurances but  unfortunately  my health insurance  travel Insurance  and Veteran Benefits have denied coverage for overseas care. I am needing to receive chemo in Boston for the next 8 months and my doctor at Dana-Farber has insisted that I not seek employment until this grueling chemo schedule is complete. Staring at this England bill  I am realizing that these next 8 months of traveling from Maine to Boston weekly and receiving treatments and medications at Dana-Farber are accruing another large bill that I can’t afford.  As many of you know  I did not have a wonderful start in life. Coming from a poor Ethiopian orphanage and being adopted into a family whose parents struggle with mental illness  created a less than happy or easy childhood. I feel blessed to have landed in a home where I observed and felt love. Once I graduated from high school I entered the Army and served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Upon the end of my enlistment  I went to Hospitality/ Travel School which lead me to my job in Hawaii on a Cruise Ship. My plan during my five week break this summer was to visit family for 2 weeks and travel Europe for 3 before returning to the ship. I want to thank everyone who has supported me over these last couple of months and want to thank you in advance for considering helping me to soften this obstacle in my life. No contribution is too small and any amount is appreciated. I have come to learn that life is unpredictable and only the Here and Now is what matters-not tomorrow or yesterday-just today. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. With deep gratitude  Jeremiah,23812,75000,15,32,146,679,6

Homer Exchange,https://www.gofundme.com/syringe-access-for-the-kenai,7,HOMER,AK,Alaska is caught in an epidemic; transmission of Hepatitis C has increased in some rural areas of Alaska by 490 percent in just the last few years.  Syringe access programs have been recognized by the Institute of Medicine as a cost effective way to prevent Hepatitis C and HIV  reduce improperly disposed of needles  and provide an access to health care for people who use drugs; however in Homer  Alaska  the nearest syringe access program is 220 miles away. Increasing rates of Hepatitis C among intravenous drug users sparked a grassroots community effort to create a local syringe access program in June  2016 through an all-volunteer staff  small grants  and nationwide online resources.To date  this effort has provided over 20 000 free sterile syringes and 100 lifesaving Narcan kits  needle disposal  on site HIV and Hepatitis C testing  education and connection to additional resources and services. Called “the Exchange ” this community collaboration helped create the Southern Kenai Peninsula Opioid Task Force that now includes communities outside of Homer and aims to find local solutions to a national epidemic. People travel miles to reach The Exchange  often through tough weather  so The Exchange offers as many kits as they need to follow safe sterile injection practices until they can return. The Exchange is entirely volunteer run  but is still reliant on our community's generosity to help fund this critically needed public health service. We are hoping to raise $2000 to buy syringes and other clean injection supplies for the next 4-6 months  as our demand has far outpaced grant funding. If we raise an additional $500  The Exchange will be able to buy and maintain sharps disposal boxes for use in Homer's public bathrooms  keeping needles off the beach and off the spit. The Exchange sincerely appreciates your support-- even the smallest donation goes a long way in making our community a better place for all of us to live and thrive.You can learn more about how this critical public service helps our community  or how to replicate it in yours  by contacting The Exchange:  HomerExchange@gmail.com or the Southern Kenai Peninsula Opioid Task Force: SKPOpioidTaskForce@gmail.com.Learn more about the Exchange:  http://www.kbbi.org/post/exchange-offers-clean-needles-and-moreWhy sharps disposal benefits us all:  https://www.homernews.com/news/box-of-syringes-collected-on-spit/Syringe Access Facts:  https://harmreduction.org/issues/syringe-access/Thank you for your support!,595,2500,6,24,14,206,6
Fight Like Stacy,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-like-stacy,9,NEWPORTRICHEY,FL,“I’m sitting here trying to wrap my head around the fact that the littles [the twins] are two and a half and are about to have a little sister  and it just doesn’t feel real. I’m pretty sure they were in preemie onesies five minutes ago  and now they’re these people with favorite books who love to cook and swim and have their own ideas  and I’m fully rambling. But it’s just one of those nights where I’m completely baffled and completely grateful to have ended up here.” On September 10  Stacy Dicorte shared this caption on Instagram beneath this beautiful picture of her and her two-year-old  curly-haired daughter  Ava. This was just eight days before racing to the hospital with the most severe and most frightening  case of preeclampsia her doctors have ever seen.  Stacy Dicorte; the organizer  whose to-do lists have to-do lists  and whose excel tabs have tabs upon tabs of their own. Who is never late  but knows and accepts that you will be. Stacy; the flexible preparer  whose plan B is always backed by plans C  D  and E. Who turns unexpected rainy days into the best damn thing that ever happened. Stacy; the witty  the smart  the quick  who will have your cheeks wet with laughter  but will put you in line the moment you deserve it. Stacy; the friend  the mom  the wife  the daughter  the hard worker  and most of all  the loved.   Despite exhibiting lifelong habits of preparation there was nothing that Stacy  or anyone else  could have done differently to prevent the devastating and life altering events that occurred over the last two weeks.  However  there is hope and healing on the horizon with the help of our community  family  and medical professionals. We have to fight for Stacy  for her kids  and for her family.  On Tuesday  September 18th  2018 Stacy was admitted into the hospital at 33 weeks pregnant with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia can cause high blood pressure  extreme swelling  seizures and can be fatal for both the mother and baby. Doctors wanted to monitor her and Emmy closely to ensure their safety. Little did we know  that five short days later  Stacy would be induced that following Sunday. Pre-eclampsia had developed into full blown eclampsia  both Stacy and her little girl were facing a grim outcome if doctors did not respond swiftly.The doctors acted quickly and diligently throughout an emergency c-section to ensure they both remained in good health. Precious Emmy was born on September 23rd at 8:03am weighing a little over three pounds and 18 inches long. Emmy has shown us that she is a fighter just like her mom. She is already off of oxygen machines and now weighs more than four pounds. Emmy was improving and out of the woods  however  Stacy began to experience complications that none of us imagined.  Often times pre-eclampsia and eclampsia will remedy itself when the baby is delivered. Stacy was experiencing lasting effects and symptoms of eclampsia days after her c-section. On Friday  September 28th her blood pressure started to skyrocket  her lungs began filling with fluid  her kidneys were failing  and she was in postpartum congestive heart failure. None of us knew what to expect  but we tried to remain faithful in Stacy’s strong and stoic nature. On Sunday  September 30th  one whole week after Emmy was born  Stacy was able to wake up. Her blood pressure became manageable  the doctors had drained two pounds of fluids from her lungs  and her kidneys were improving. We were ecstatic!! That became a fleeting feeling as we noticed that Stacy was not herself in many ways. Stacy showed signs of severe memory loss and had limited motor functionality. She struggled to remember who her loved ones were and she was unable to perform basic tasks like feeding herself. We requested that the doctors order a CT Scan of her brain. We knew there was a chance that her brain may have been deprived of oxygen  but we were unaware of the exact implications of this complication.Upon further testing doctors identified that Stacy’s heart had a hole in it. The hole has likely been there since birth and had never been identified or caused an issue until she started experiencing high blood pressure. Stacy also formed several blood clots in her legs. These clots moved through her bloodstream and generally would have stopped in her heart. However  due to the hole in her heart the blood clots went to her brain. Stacy suffered a series of strokes and was displaying symptoms of a stroke survivor.  A few days after waking up  Stacy also endured a heart attack due to lack of oxygen. While we will continue to fight  doctors cannot predict what setbacks Stacy may face.  At the young age of 30 years old Stacy shows great promise to make a meaningful recovery and can retain her speech  motor  and physical functionality. We have seen unprecedented progress in the last week. Her speech and memory has greatly improved and she is making strides to feed herself. We are so proud of our warrior!!The American Stroke Association estimates that the lifetime cost for a stroke survivor is $140  048. This is to address out of pocket expenses for inpatient care  rehabilitation  and follow-up care necessary for lasting deficits. Stacy will be transported to an inpatient care facility where she will have four hours of therapy  seven days a week. We will also be reaching out to the Patient Advocate Foundation for monetary and logistical support.In addition to medical costs  Stacy and her husband  Jimmy  also have two year old twins  Ava and Logan.  As Jimmy and Stacy navigate intensive therapy treatments and work toward her recovery  childcare costs will accrue for the twins and Emmy. Due to Emmy’s early arrival  Stacy and Jimmy were still in the process of securing a vehicle that would be able to fit a family of five with three car seats.  As Stacy and Jimmy embark on this new journey  we are asking our community and family to come together to support them.  Any donation to aid in Stacy’s recovery and to help offset these unforeseen and substantial costs would be deeply appreciated. We ask you to fight like Stacy! We look forward to updating you about Stacy’s progress as we continue to fight alongside her and her family!,3000,100000,7,3,48,595,6

A Breath Of Air,https://www.gofundme.com/68f31k8,0,DENISON,TX,Most of you know the struggles I've been having with my nasal passages and not being able to breathe. I honestly never thought I would find anyone willing to try and resolve this issue for me. For more than 15 years I've watched this growth on both sides of my nose get bigger  and my breathing through my nose get to the point of impossible. Now  after 6 Ear Nose & Throat doctors I have finally found someone willing to remove them and hopefully find out what they actually are. That being said  I am now facing some financial struggles. It takes a lot of pride to ask for help from the people you know  but I am asking for whatever small help you can give. Im just trying to raise enough to cover the cost of the surgery center and my Dr charges  as they have to be paid up front. The Pathologist and Anesthesiologist will bill me and I will pay them as I can. I can only hope for the day that I'm able to take that deep breath through my nose....I've forgotten what that's like. If you cant help financially I accept positive thoughts as well because everything counts in my book. Thanks for reading guys I know it was long!,250,2000,12,13,5,32,6

The heart of Ace,https://www.gofundme.com/the-heart-of-ace,0,COLUMBUS,IN,Ace was born April 12th 2018 with an undisclosed heart defect. Transposition of the great arteries. In July of 2017 we found out we were expecting our 6th and last child of a combined family. We were excited as well as worried about one more. We have five other children Joseph 13  Jeremiah 12  Jayden 10  Elijah 8  and Ivory 4 (the only girl). They were all so excited especially Ivory. Finding out he was going to be another boy was a special moment for the whole family. He was a planned cecerian  I've had two other cecerians before  I knew the routine. Once Ace was delivered at 11:29 am I looked over as the doctor handed him off to a nurse and looked at Joshua and asked what was wrong? The doctor said he had fluid in his lungs  it was normal for babys born that way because he didnt her the extra push on his lungs. My gut hurt though. Looking over there at my baby I was nervous. He was blue  he was crying though  I could hear it. I asked Joshua again what was wrong. He assured me he was perfectly fine. The nurse and Joshua took Ace to the nursery. I was left with my own thoughts on what was going on. After I was done they brought me back to the room. A nurse told me my baby would be in the room when I got back. He wasnt. Joshua was sitting in the room alone  I could tell he was scared but said nothing. Hours later after all the worry  the crying  the wondering  and no answers a doctor finally came in the room to explain to me what was going on. She explained Ace had a heart defect. His two main arteries were flipped. We were told he would be life lined to a hospital an hour away. At 9pm I finally got to meet my son while he was in an incubator getting ready for his trip. They rolled him in so I could say my goodbyes to him. Two days later we were able to make the drive up there  I finally got to touch our baby. I got to see him  kiss him  feel his little fingers. As I walked into the room I nearly fell to my knees waiting for this very moment. Ace was going to get an arterial switch to flip his arteries  due to the location of the way they were positioned he was unable to get the arterial switch. He had open heart surgery at 5 days old to prolong his life until he is able to grow a little more in hope of getting the artirial switch. He got a band around his heart as well as a shunt to help his heart function for now. After his procedure we needed rest  we had been up for days. We went down the road to Joshua's mothers to sleep. There was never sleep  only tears. Everything racing through my mind. At 8pm we got a phone call from a nurse. She explained Ace was in critical condition and we needed to be there incase it was his last moments. She continued to tell us they had been working with him since 5pm to get his vitals stable and that they were running out of options. My heart sank in  He fought 10 straight hours for his little life. Sitting in the room watching the doctors and nurses yell  monitors beeping like crazy and his lifeless body just laying there was the hardest thing a mother and father could watch. Finally at 3 am  Ace settled down his vitals were stable and he was finally resting. Days went by  he got stronger everday. 15 days later I finally got to hold him.We brought the rest of the children to finally meet their baby brother they have been waiting to meet very anxiously. Ace's now has two leaking artires and is going to have his next open heart procedure in the beginning of December. We are thankful he has now made it 6 months. They are unsure of what they will be doing if they are unable to do his artirial switch  I will be signing many different options for procedures. Were asking for help to support Ace as well as our children during his time in the hospital in Decemeber. It's already a rough month with Christmas but all we want as a family for Christmas is Ace's heart to be strong. There are many more details but there is not enough words to describe the hardship we have endured the last 6 months. Ace is a fighter. He is strong. Ace is always so happy. He loves to play peekaboo with his sister  eat his bottles  roll over  and laugh. He is the light of the home.,265,2000,2,13,5,305,6

We didn’t know what to expect but we knew that Jesus was with her and that He would be with us in the process. Thank you so much for giving! We look forward to blessing their family by removing the day to day financial burden during this time.  Jason Gilbert  a close family friend and co-worker  will be handling the funds for the Sigmon family while they have an extended stay in the hospital.

BUT our God is so much bigger than any earthly healer. HE is the ultimate healer and we praise Jesus for all the miracles we have already witnessed in Savanna’s life and the life of precious baby boy Sigmon today.

Help River get Top Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/wqjtku-help-river-get-top-surgery,6,Toronto,ON,Hey friends  my name is River Cecil Oliveira! I'm a queer  non-binary trans person and in about a year I'm going to be getting top surgery! This is a super important step for me that is going to be very good for my health. But before that I need to be able to pay for it! And this is where you come in. While most of the surgery is covered under OHIP (I'm in Toronto  Canada) there is a key part of it that is not. And this part is going to cost about $2000! While I do have a job  most of that money is going into paying my rent and paying for me to attend school. Which means I'm going to need a bit of help. This surgery is going to majorly change my life and get rid of a lot of the dysphoria that contributes to a lot of weird and bad mental health things that I experience as a result. So  if you've got the funds it'd be majorly wonderful of you if you could help me out & if you don't that's totally okay - spreading this around is help enough. If you have any questions  comments  or concerns don't hesitate to contact me. I hope you have a wonderful day!,2058,2260,17,91,59,224,6
Help Aurora&apos;s Daddy Get Better!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-auroras-daddy-get-better,7,EADS,TN,Dear Friends I'm writing on behalf of my sister's sweet family who is going through a really rough time. Grace and David have been married for just over two years and have a beautiful two-month-old baby girl named Aurora.In the summer of 2015  David’s health suddenly took a dive. He began to experience extreme nausea on a daily basis  combined with a discomfort he described as “sunburn on the inside of my abdomen”. Shortly after he also began to experience weakness. It was a slow descent at first in 2015 and 2016  but by the fall/winter of 2017 his illness accelerated at an alarming rate. In the past few years they have tried many approaches to solving and treating the problem. He consulted with two different GI doctors  tried dietary changes  nutritional treatment  certain lifestyle changes  and medication options and though some of the dietary changes helped  nothing fully solved the issue.His other symptoms have included:-nausea-burning-uncontrollable weight loss-circulation issues ranging from his arms going “dead” randomly to blacking out when he gets up-extreme mental fog-erratic bowel movements-sleep has no effect in reducing exhaustion or self healing -loss of appetite-general lack of drive and zest for life and an overall sense of exhaustion and sickliness-progressive weakness (can’t even hold his infant daughter for more than 15 minutes without his arms feeling burnt out)David has been seeing a local specialist since April of this year who diagnosed him with the following:-SIBO-yeast overgrowth -allergies and intolerances to gluten  dairy  egg  yeast and several other lesser food elements-hyperactive immune system (which has caused hormonal imbalance and certain strains on the performance of some vital organs) -4 different bacterial infections This local specialist has helped treat the above diagnoses  which has largely removed the nausea  burning  and (temporarily) some of the weakness and mental fog. However  though some of David's symptoms have mostly cleared up  they are still in the middle of a months-long process to rid his body of the bacterial infections  and meantime his overall health is continuing to deteriorate. The physical weakness  mental fog  exhaustion  and circulation issues are worsening exponentially and more persistent medical help has become urgent. He can barely make it through a single day  and there is clearly a deeper and more insidious concern that has not been diagnosed yet that is threatening David’s health and possibly even his life.David and Grace's most recent appointment with their local specialist shed a little bit more light on things. Based on the progression of symptoms and description of them  the doctor is suspecting something along the lines of Myasthenia (an autoimmune disease that attacks the muscles) or much worse  potentially Multiple Sclerosis. They're running more blood tests to test for some autoimmune diseases and starting a medication that would help treat (and diagnose) the myasthenia. They should know within 2 weeks if that is the answer. If these tests and trial run of meds don’t work it’ll be time to do MRIs of the brain and spine. Some basic reflex tests show the possibility of some sort of neurological problem which could be part of the autoimmune condition.However  considering the breadth and severity of David's symptoms  they are also seeking a second opinion and possible continued treatment from another diagnostic specialist who deals mainly with how dietary and lifestyle patterns affect overall health. However  this specialist is in New Jersey  while David and Grace live in Tennessee. They have booked an appointment with the specialist  but they need help getting there  as well as with all their ongoing medical expenses.David's job is barely allowing them to make ends meet right now  and the weaker he gets the harder it is for him even to make it to work. Grace contributes what she can as a piano teacher  but juggling work  a newborn baby  and a sick husband can be overwhelming! So  without access to health insurance  they're finding it difficult to keep up with normal household expenses  let alone medical bills.The amount of $6000 would cover David's current medical treatment for about the next six months  as well as the estimated cost of initial consultation and diagnosis with the new specialist  including travel. As a continued course of treatment is determined  we'll update you on any additional funds needed.Please consider what you're able to give to help this lovely family in need. And more than anything  please keep them in your prayers. Pray especially for David's recovery  but also for peace  patience  and trust in the Lord's care  and daily provision for Grace and Aurora. David is one of the sweetest  gentlest guys I've ever met  and a loving husband and father. His family needs him back!Peace Rebekah,5000,6000,14,83,43,232,6
Teresa&apos;s Liver Cancer/Transplant,https://www.gofundme.com/teresa039s-liver-cancertransplant,0,TOLEDO,OH,In September  my parents found out that my Mom has liver cancer and would need a transplant.  They were shocked to find out that her medical records revealed possible indications as far back as August of 2017  as her doctors in our hometown of Toledo never mentioned cancer.  A couple weeks later it was determined that a partial transplant will not work in her situation and she will need a full liver transplant.  She has begun working with a great team at Cleveland Clinic   however the already high expense of getting treatment and the transplant  combined with the additional expenses of travel and lost work time for my dad is simply more than we are able to handle on our own.Nearly thirty-six years ago  my parents met when my mom was a nurse's aide at the rehab my dad was at after a permanently disabling motorcycle accident.  Their relationship began with her caring for him  and now he is doing the best he can to return the favor and care for her.  My younger sister lives with them due to her cognitive learning disability  and entirely depend on them financially and with raising her two sons who are 6 & 7.Both my parents are eligible for disability and my mom currently receives payments.  My dad  however  has not received his disability for 6 months now because Social Security erroneously came to the conclusion that he had received an overpayment and was not eligible  even though he has been disabled his entire adult life.  He has since received a letter from Social Security stating they are responsible for the error and he does still qualify  but they have yet to resume his payments.  He has not been able to go and pursue the matter though because since my Mom's diagnosis  all his extra energy and time is going into caring for her and getting her to weekly appointments two hours from home.  He does hold a very part time job but he has exhausted all his sick pay.  My husband and I are helping as much as we can  but none of us were prepared for this kind of financial challenge.  We are also becoming increasingly limited in what we can do because I am now coming to appointments with my parents to help my dad get around and also learn as much as I can to keep family and friends updated as things progress  and I do not presently have time to cover all the hours I'm missing.Currently  on October 8th  my dad and I are in a hotel room in Cleveland because my mom has been unexpectedly admitted.  We arrived on October 5th for my mom's first chemoembolization treatment and had expected to be returning home the next day.  Her team at Cleveland Clinic actually had to squeeze her in as originally they were unable to schedule her until November  but her current progression of the cancer meant she needed treated as soon as possible.  Though she was discharged as planned   we ended up rushing her to the emergency room after she had slept for a couple hours  during which time she seemed to have some difficulty breathing  then woke with shaking chills and had developed a temperature.  After running tests the doctor had her admitted around 1 am Sunday morning.  We still haven't received a definite diagnosis  though the possibility of an infection has been mentioned.  She has been growing increasingly feisty throughout her stay so far  which we are taking as a good sign as it's a huge change from her state after her initial discharge and readmission  so we are hopeful that she may be released tomorrow and we will have a complete understanding of what happened.During the next two weeks  we will be traveling back and forth for follow-up appointments to see the results of her first treatment.  At the end of the month  we will need to be in Cleveland for a week during which time she will go through an evaluation before being put on the donor list.  This is another thing that was originally scheduled much farther out  but her team felt the need to push her through quicker.  I honestly don't yet know exactly what to expect as far as the kind of expenses that will add up relating to her care and treatment after the transplant.  Her appointment Friday was the first I was able to come for  so I haven't personally spoken with the doctor to ask questions  but intend to do so as soon as possible.  From what my dad and I have been able to look up so far  other similar Go Fund Me campaigns are trying to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Until I've had the chance to talk to someone directly about my mom's situation and expected treatment plan and have had some time to do some real research on what we might be facing  I don't feel right asking for help with more than our current goal  but feel fairly certain that the expenses will easily exceed this campaign.  I know the medical bills are already starting to pile up for my parents.  My mom has a team of specialists in Cleveland  along with several doctors back home that she is regularly seeing  so co-pays are already becoming overwhelming.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this  and please keep my mom and our family in your thoughts.  Whether or not you can donate  know that we are grateful beyond words for all the support-financial and emotional-we receive   though I truly do hate to have to ask.  Even if you cannot donate  Please Share This! Just being able to reach out in this way is amazing  but we need all the help we can get.  I intend to keep updating things and being as transparent as I can with everything that happens through this chapter of Mom's life as a way to help build as much support as I can for her while creating a little more awareness.,1090,5000,5,22,18,293,6
Rebekah Eden - Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/wpt3ng-overwhelming-medical-bills,0,LEXINGTON,KY,The short version is simple. I nearly died. It took me months to recover and be able to go back to work. And durring that time $350 000 worth of medical bills went into collections. I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease when i was 25.  And at the end of 2017 this disease nearly killed me.  And without health insurance the bills have been beyond crazy. In October of 2017 my husband's job offered to hire him full time starting November 1st. It included extremely good health insurance. The cost for both of us was going to be less then what I was paying for just me. We were really excited. We filled out all the paperwork. And I called my insurance company to cancel my current policy as of the end of the month. Over the next two weeks everything at his job turned sour. It became a really impossible situation. The specifics don't matter. Just know neither you nor I would ever put up with what he was dealing with. So we discussed it  and he chose to get another job. I called my insurance company to undo the cancelation. (My policy was still active at the time) However they would not let me undo it. I was going to be without insurance for two months. Without insurance I could not afford my medication. How could I? It costs $7000 per month! I had no choice but to hope that I would be fine until January. I wasn't. Around 11pm Christmas Eve  My husband  Alexander  rushed me to the hospital because something was VERY wrong with me.  I have never been so scared in my life.  For most of the night  those wonderful people at the ER dedicated themselves to saving my life.  By 4am  I was far from out of danger  but I was stable enough to be moved to an ICU across town. I honestly don't remember those next few days.  I woke up and was immediately overcome by husband's relief that I had woken up.  And thanks to him  I have pieced together everything that happened. My intestines had started leaking into my body causing me to go into septic shock.  I spent several days on life support.  I even needed a blood transfusion.  But eventually I pulled through  and got to wake up and talk to my family. All the doctors told me I had a long way to go in order to recover. But I didn't really understand what they meant by that.  How could I?  I had never been that sick before. Nine months later  I understand very well what they meant.  I have been to hundreds of doctor's appointments.  I have had two surgeries.  I've been on an ostomy bag for 6 months.  I have suffered from severe dehydration (drinking more then a gallon of water every day and it wasn't enough).  I developed acute adrenal insufficiency.  The only positive thing was that I lost 40 pounds. But this is hardly the way anyone wants to do it. It has been really hard to stay positive through all of it.  It has taken a lot of support from my family and friends.  I spent months without the physical strength to take care of myself.  I was so weak that i needed help with little things like bathing  getting dressed  and even just walking. I am doing better now.  The ostomy has been reversed  and I am healing well. And for the most part I can take care of myself.  But I am still dealing with lingering issues from this whole ordeal. My kidneys are not in good shape. And it is hard to concentrate  especially at work. I am slowly getting back to a normal life.  But I still have this mountain of medical bills in collections.  I am paying what i can.  But I dont know how i could ever pay it all off. I greatly appreciate anything you can do to help.  I am asking for a fraction of what I owe.  But even this will be make a huge difference in my financial situation.,530,10000,12,5,6,38,6

Cece&apos;s breast cancer fund,https://www.gofundme.com/cece039s-breast-cancer-fund,1,CALISTOGA,CA,On October 8th our amazing friend and family member Cece Stevens Mcgee received news that she has breast cancer.  Cece is currently working to acquire the optimal insurance plan to cover part of the treatment of her choice  but medical emergencies like this always come with co-pays and unforeseen expenses and we want her to receive the best care possible. Recovery time for these procedures vary  but they anticipate it will take at least a few months.  She will need to cover living expenses while she is healing from surgery and unable to work.  She has to make a lot of serious decisions in a very short time  so alleviating her worry of money will help her tremendously with the amount of stress she is dealing with.If you know Cece  you know how incredible she is. She has awe-inspiring energy  an unbelievably loving spirit  and is one of the sweetest friends. She has tremendous passion towards life  health and her blossoming career as a culinary gardener/farmer. We love Cece so much and know she has a very large community of friends and strangers she has inspired who are more than happy to be there for her during this challenging time.Any donation amount helps.  Any unused funds when all is said and done will be donated to other GoFundMe's for people also struggling through breast cancer. We are in constant contact with Cece and will keep you all updated.,17030,50000,10,34,105,860,6
Help the Schmalings Care for Maisie,https://www.gofundme.com/help-the-schmalings-care-for-maisie,0,Kelowna,BC,"-Unexpected Delivery-\We need to deliver your baby in 2 hours.\"" These were the words that changed our lives forever on August 23rd and precipitated the delivery of our fourth child--a girl!--Maisie June Schmaling. With a possible blood clot in her umbilical cord  the doctors decided we needed to deliver Maisie at 27 weeks (3 months early) and avoid any life-threatening risks. We had not planned for this  really. Her nursery at home was not ready--we weren't ready. But she came to us that night  and this began quite the odyssey for the Schmaling family.-Tale of Two Cities-Because Maisie was born so premature  and due to her having surgery on her intestine (and resulting stoma)  and testing for brain abnormalities (she had seizure-like symptoms)  we have not been able to live together as a family  and will not for the foreseeable future. Maisie needs to stay at the Vancouver Women's Hospital NICU  receiving specialized care  while our three boys (Elijah-8  Rafael-6  and Pascal-3.8) need to be in Kelowna going to school and having some semblance of \""normal\"" life. This means Bethany has been living at the Ronald McDonald House across from the hospital  staying with and holding Maisie as much as possible  and debriefing with doctors  etc......Marcus  meanwhile  has been holding down the fort in Kelowna and  along with help from Grandma and Oma  taking the boys to school  basketball  lessons  etc. It's only on the weekend that we all come together as a family in Vancouver and enjoy special times with Maisie.-Financial Strain-And now we come to the purpose of this GoFundMe. There are several fiscal realities converging that are causing quite a financial strain on our family as we seek to care for Maisie. One: Beth's income stream has decreased because she is on maternity leave. Two: Marcus went on an unpaid leave of absence from work in order to care for himself and the family  and consequently his income has diminished quite significantly. And Three: our food and transportation expenses have gone up considerably with life lived between Kelowna and Vancouver. As we survey the next while we believe our financial shortfall will be around $6 000.-The Ask-After much thinking and talking and praying and more talking about this matter  Beth and Marcus feel a peace about bringing this need to your attention. We have been overwhelmed by how many people have connected with Maisie's story  reaching out with words and gifts and so many other creative expressions of love. It is to you  this big and beautiful community of caring people  that we humbly ask that you consider supporting us in our financial need  so that we can have this \""hurdle\"" taken care of. We really want to be freed up to solely focus on loving our baby  Maisie  and the three boys  and one another. -Thank You-Whether you help us financially  or conceive another way of supporting us  please know that your care for us has given us a buoyancy and hope to believe we will get through this  that it is possible for Maisie to one day be completely healthy  and that one day we can all live together in a house in Kelowna.God bless you all!Marcus & Bethany Schmaling""",12060,6000,22,201,117,279,6
Lawyer and Car Emergency,https://www.gofundme.com/lawyer-and-car-emergency,5,FAYETTEVILLE,AR,I am doing this fundraiser for Bill hopefully to get his money back on the car that was taken and a down payment on a new car the story is below in his wordsMy auto accident from three years ago Is still trying to get me apparently. My friend Pat  who passed away suddenly 2 1/2 weeks ago  out of the goodness of her heart arranged financing for a car for me that I have been paying on  a really sweet 2011 BMW  because I was not mentally capable of doing any sort of business at that time. Unfortunately the car remained in her name despite my efforts to make it differently. The son that swooped in the first day and took her car and came the next day and took her TV and anything of value and left a huge mess for me that has taken over two weeks to get together.... showed up at my house late this evening and told me he was taking my car. Do it the hard way and give him the keys or call the police  so we call the police  bottom line is since it was in her name and he is next of kin the 18 000 or more dollars I have invested in that car is gone along with the car. Tomorrow is call the finance company  get a statement from the finance company about my payments  call my bank to verify those  and find a lawyer  this just so totally sucks.... The really bad part it was 7 or 8 months away from being paid off  plus when he originally showed up he said he would not interfere with anything that I have  what a complete asshole  he cared nothing for his mother never called her  nothing....And now he took my car,1190,5000,13,24,22,131,6
"For Emmy, With Love",https://www.gofundme.com/for-emmy-with-love,1,SANFRANCISCO,CA,On April 23rd  our friend Emmy was diagnosed with Stage 2A  triple positive  IDC breast cancer.Since it was a fast growing tumor  she had to start chemotherapy as soon as possible and began 6 rounds of chemotherapy 10 days after receiving the diagnosis. Chemotherapy alone was not enough to prevent recurrence however and Emmy had to make the difficult decision to have her breasts removed and underwent bilateral mastectomy on September 26. She is currently in recovery and will be undergoing the reconstruction process in the next few months. Reconstruction surgery is a multistep process that could take until 2019 to complete and will include post-surgery adjustments. Given the type of cancer (HER2/neu-positive) she has  Emmy will have to continue monthly intravenous targeted treatment until May 2019. She will also have to continue hormone injections and drugs for the next 5 years to prevent any possible recurrence.Emmy has insurance that covers some of these costs  but medical emergencies like this always come with co-pays  co-insurance  deductibles  and other uncovered and unforeseen expenses. She has taken time off work for surgery and recovery but has continued to work in an advisory role throughout the whole treatment process. Given the cost associated with all the medical procedures  she has spent all of her life savings on deductibles  out of pocket expenses and will be expected to spend much more over the coming years. Emmy has had to make these very serious decisions in a very short time period. Alleviating the worry of money around the mounting medical expenses  would be a tremendous weight lifted amidst the many stressors she is already dealing with. We are reaching out to the extended design/architecture/construction community and beyond to ask for support and donations to help one of our own get back on her feet. If you know Emmy  you know how vibrant and fearless she is. She is a wonder woman of action who never seems to take a break or back down from a challenge whether that is navigating a unique career from interior design to construction or quick studying a completely new holistic diet to beat cancer. We love her so much and know she has a very large community of friends and strangers she’s inspired who want to be there for her in this traumatic time.Please help Emmy beat this thing - any donation amount helps! She is immensely grateful for all the love and support shown so far. It's truly heartwarming to see an entire community come together to help a single person. Any extra funds that don’t go to Emmy’s medical expenses will be donated to The Ellie Fund a non-profit organization that fights breast cancer and eases its effects on patients and families. They provide critical support services free of charge to enhance quality of life including transportation to medical appointments  childcare  housekeeping  groceries  and nutritious delivered meals.Thank you and please share!,37506,60000,31,63,166,207,6

Fight For  Mayson and Family!,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-for-mayson-and-family,5,CASPER,WY,On May 9  2018 Mayson was riding his bike and enjoying the outdoors when tragedy struck. Mayson was hit by a car. During the accident Mayson suffered a brain aneurysm and had to undergo a lengthy process to have it pipelines and coiled.    Due to his medication Mayson must undergo very specific blood work testing. And all the facilities qualified to perform these tests are unfortunately 4+ hours away from him and his family.    Mayson’s mother has been battling with the drivers insurance company for months now! Trying to get some financial relief  but so far no luck. Mayson’s mother has been forced to quit her job and stay home with him.    While this incident was tragic- it was also a blessing in disguise. During the accident doctors revealed to Mayson and his family that he was living with a rare genetic condition known as Tuberous Sclerosis.    This is a rare multi system genetic disease which causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and other vital organs such as kidneys  heart  liver  eyes  lungs  and skin. This genetic disease also causes seizures- which can be terrifying for parents.    Mayson's Blog Page   https://www.facebook.com/Mightmayson2009/,2058,10000,7,21,31,354,6

Help Chris kick Cancers Butt!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-chris-kick-melanomas-butt,0,SANDIEGO,CA,My boyfriend Chris and I have been together for 4 years now and he was just recently diagnosed with Melanoma cancer of the brain. I assume most would associate this specific kind of cancer with skin (as I did) but unfortunately it's not. On Sunday September 30th  Chris went to work feeling a bit lethargic   but didn't think much of it.  After about an hour of working the right side of his abdomen went numb and he began to feel dizzy and woozy. Shortly after  Chris experienced his first seizure  ever. He was taken by ambulance to Palomar hospital and had a triage of tests only to be told there was nothing wrong. A few hours later  we were having dinner with his parents when a second seizure came on much more aggressively and lasted about 5 minutes which included him being unable to breathe.  We took him back to Palomar hospital and sat in the emergency room for hours patiently waiting to see if they were going to admit him. Finally  at 4 am he was admitted.It was during his stay that they decided to do some CAT scans both of his brain and abdomen area as well as an MRI. It was at this time they discovered two masses in his brain  one on each side as well as one near his groin.  They were originally going to do a brain biopsy but opted to do a biopsy on the groin because it was less invasive. After a week-long stay at the hospital the results came back as Melanoma. As many of you can imagine  this was devastating. He is relatively young (42) and in good health so this came as a shock to us all because he had no symptoms. Right now  we are unsure of the stage he is at because we haven't had a PET scan to know if it is anywhere else in the body. We do know that he will soon be starting radiation on the masses in his brain followed by chemotherapy. I just pray that we caught this in time to nip this thing in the ass. I feel like everyone knows and understands why I started this campaign for my love. This is going to be very expensive considering the treatments and the fact he will not be able to work for quite some time. I can't bear the fact that his parents are going to try and take care of most of these expenses on their own. They are trying to cope with the fact that their eldest child is dealing with a life-threatening disease. How can we expect them to deal with the financial burden as well?This is where my friends and family come into play. I don't expect everyone to be donating an arm and a leg  I know everyone has bills to pay and crisis' of their own to deal with. I am just hoping that I can raise enough to help ease some of this burden. I love him  help me save him. Thank you!,7980,10000,13,80,95,538,6
Support Anderson&apos;s Heart Surgeries,https://www.gofundme.com/support-anderson039s-heart-surgeries,0,HORSEHEADS,NY,"This summer we received the news that our son Anderson was going to be born with a congenital heart condition called CCTGA (Congenital Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries). CCTGA is very rare (it affects 0.5% of all CHD's) and to be corrected it requires several complicated surgeries  best done in the first year or so of life. Lucky for us we have found an amazing team of surgeons and doctors at Boston's Children's Hospital who are knowledgeable about this disorder and are ready to start helping Anders when he arrives in early November. We have spent the last months getting excited and ready to welcome our little man  while simultaneously researching medical procedures and planning (both logistically and financially) for all of the surgeries he will be having. Anyone who knows us knows how much we love to have every aspect of our life planned out to the fullest  so this has been a real challenge. It is all complicated by the fact that the surgical timeline is up in the air  depending upon what the doctors see in the echocardiograms taken right after he is born.We are very thankful for our amazing insurance   but we have run into some difficulty when it comes to finding housing in Boston. Boston is very limited in the amount of subsidized patient/family housing they can provide. We have talked extensively with the hospital social workers and there is a months long waiting list at many of the charity houses  and we would not even be able to get onto the waiting list until after he is born and a surgery date has been scheduled. His first surgery will either be the first week or month of life  so that leaves us very little time to plan. The hospital does allow one parent to sleep in the fold out chair in the room with Anders and use the public bathrooms with access to a shower  but this would obviously not be an ideal situation over weeks or months of staying there  especially when we have our toddler daughter to think about.As a family we have been looking at other options to try and stay together to support each other during this difficult time. Since we will be gone for so long  we cannot fathom leaving our 18 month old daughter behind  especially over the holidays. We have looked into getting a hotel until hopefully we could get into one of the charity houses  but even the cheap hotels cost just under $300 a night. This means if we have to stay for a month or more we are looking at a significant bill. We have also looked into renting a furnished apartment for a month or finding a long term Airbandb  but both would cost at least $5 000 and in either case we would be locked into paying for the whole month  even if the charity houses were to have a room open up part way through our stays. If space does open up we were told that it may not cover our whole stay or be able to accommodate a family. The social worker explained that many families decide to leave one parent at home  while the other travels to care for their ill child. They realize that there is high need for family housing  but are often unable to provide it. On top of the cost of housing in Boston we will have travel expenses  parking costs  food  the bills at home  and Kirsten may have to take some unpaid time at the end of her maternity leave before she can apply for the sick bank to get some paid time off from work.  As of right now  Kirsten will be taking months off of work (just for his first surgery) to care for the medical needs of our son. Between the two of us  we will be paying back the sick bank for years to come. We are very thankful though that we have that option available to us. After spending months looking at the costs and trying to find any savings we can  we have come to realize that we are going to need help.I can honestly say that this is the most difficult thing that I have ever tried to write. Both Kirsten and I have a hard time putting aside our pride and asking for help. On top of this so many people have already provided help that we are very grateful for  that it seems shameful to ask for more. But  it is even more frustrating to catch myself worrying more about how I am going to pay for everything than about my child's health.  I am discovering that these are the realities for parents of sick children and the one thing I cannot afford is to be too prideful.Please consider helping our family out in our time of need. No contribution is too small be it money  a hug  or a prayer (please send hugs and prayers in person as they are difficult to send over the internet).If you wish to keep up with our progress or want to know more about Anderson's condition follow our Facebook page by searching: \@teamtwichell\""  or \""Staying Upbeat for Anderson's Congenital Heart Defect\""If you are reading this we want to at the very least thank you for being in our lives!

Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/dc7jp-breast-cancer,1,GEORGETOWN,TX,￼￼Hello all So I’m not sure that everyone know yet but I’ve been diagnosed with tripe negative stage 2 ductal carinmoia  (breast cancer) October 1. Thursday  I went to Texas oncology to see what my options were. They stated to me that they believe the best course of action for my cancer is 5month of chemotherapy first  Surgery and then radiation. Having to face this with unbelief because we know the body is designed to heal itself. So chemotherapy doesn’t set well in my spirit. My family and I have decided to take another approach to this cancer and go to alternative medicine. UPDATE: 10/22/2018After seeing the breast surgeon she stated that my breast cancer has metastasized and it is aggressive. Its a stage 3 possible 4 if the skin biopsy results are positive which we will know in 48hrs. So the realization is that I’m going to have to start chemo-therapy very soon. So I will have to put alternative medicine to the side temporarily but it will be my future care to keep the cancer at bay. So this will increase a financial strain being that I’m a self employed massage therapist. With chemo therapy there will be a lack of physical work that I might have to take off due to the side effects. Donations for living and additional medical expenses. I don’t want to add any additional burden toward my husband and more stress to our lives. Any donations are truly appreciated wether it’s 20  30 or 40 dollars. Please share this post so we can reach our goal.,2170,30000,8,7,15,146,6

POLLAN FAMILY FUND,https://www.gofundme.com/pollan-family-fund,0,UNIVERSITYPLACE,WA,My best bud Andrew is in need of help and I'm here to tell his story in hopes you can help us reach our goal. He was the sole income supporter to his family of 8 until Monday October 1st.  Over the last couple of days he had felt off  but in normal Andrew fashion kept on going to work and putting in as much over time as possible. His wife was getting worried because he wasn't bouncing back like normal. He went in for multiple blood draws to see if his previously diagnosed Crohn's disease or PSC was the issue. Without an answer found from these tests it was decided that on Friday October 5th he would go for an MRI. Expecting to find out the results on Monday or Tuesday an early morning call right from his doctor on Saturday the 6th was a surprise.  This enters me  Saturday morning it was nice out  I left the house around 7am for a drive. I thought I should call Andrew but he's probably sleeping. A few minutes later I get a call  IT'S ANDREW!!!! I answer the phone all excited  and he says hey bud  can you take me to Saint Joes ER. I said yes I will be there in a few minutes. I arrived to find Andrew with his wife out front very distraught. He turns to me and I knew something was amiss. He said they told me I've got CANCER. I was in shock  I didn't know what to do or say...... What they have found is a large mass that is attached to his Liver  it has caused pressure to be applied and a block to form. He will have his first round of surgery on October 9th to place a stent in his livers bile duct and a port to begin chemo. Currently the tumor is too large to remove  chemo will be used to shrink the tumor in hopes that in a few months it will be small enough to remove. This is the game plan going forward. Now I need everyone else's help. If you can afford to help it would be amazing and if not please share this to spread the word. Any help is better than no help and every bit is greatly appreciated. He will be off work with 6 daughters at home and a loving wife. We all can get together and make their financial situation the least of their worries. This will help keep food on the table  a house to continue to live in  gas for doctors appointments & power / water. Unfortunately this won't be a fast process. Thank you everyone!,7105,20000,9,36,58,515,6
Living with the &apos;suicide disease&apos;,https://www.gofundme.com/tim-haynes-trigeminal-neuralgia,0,BOURBONNAIS,IL,"JOSEPHINE AND I during one of my mission trips to Puerto Rico to help rebuild the island devastated by Hurricane Maria. She was 85 when the hurricane came through  survived and as a builder and contractor  helped install a new roof on her house in March of this year. That was a good day.My name is Tim Haynes and I have the \suicide disease.\"" Here is my story.The technical term for the “suicide disease” is Trigeminal Neuralgia ( TN ) and there is no sure cure. I’m one of 108 000 in the U.S. that experiences the worst pain known to man. Worse than any other pain that humans have to deal with day in and day out. I’m trying to raise $17 500 to pay for the only treatment that is working  a laser machine which I can use multiple times a day at home to stop frequent attacks.Most people don’t know about Trigeminal Neuralgia ( TN ) and the kind of facial pain inflicted on its victims. It’s a pain so tortuous it has brought me to my knees. Imagine a hot searing knife being driven through your jaw. Or being constantly jabbed with a cattle prod. Imagine a feeling of your face being on fire  someone throwing acid on it and slashing it with razor blades all at same time and it’s not even breakfast time yet. Once it starts  I can’t do anything but grab whatever is closest and hold on with all my might. If I’m fortunate  the pain will last only a few minutes  but there have been times I’ve endured it for hours. Those episodes leave me beaten and exhausted. Everyday routines leave me in constant fear of the next attack: shaving  brushing my teeth  scratching or rubbing the side of my face  yawning or even a gentle breeze can set them off. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds  because it hurts so bad to eat.These bad episodes make living with the constant feeling of someone jabbing an ice pick into the side of my face easy.It gets to a point where I slur my speech. Clients think I’m drunk and I have to explain the situation. At home at times I use sign language to communicate with family because talking is so painful. Despite the pain  I went on three mission trips with my church group to Puerto Rico and helped rebuild homes for those devastated by Hurricane Maria. I also teach sign language to the deaf during weekly Bible studies.When I first started to have these horrible attacks  I thought  like most TN sufferers  it must be a tooth issue  so I went to a dentist and had root canals performed. No success.A chiropractor assistance didn’t help. Neither did acupuncture. I had a few other procedures done to no avail. I found anti-seizure medications but they only worked for so long before I got used to them and they stopped working. My first prescription did just that and my second I hoped would continue to take the edge off  but it hasn’t on most days. Then we found after long days  weeks  and months of severe pain  my son Joseph and my wife Patti did the research on laser treatment and I WAS READY TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO RID MYSELF OF PAIN.The pain occurs because the protective tissue surrounding the Trigeminal nerve  the largest in the brain  has disintegrated and other nerves put pressure on it  causing excruciating facial pain  anguish and convulsions of the worst pain doctors say a human can have.I’ve been tormented with this disease for 8 years this last September. Over 50 percent of people with TN commit suicide within the first two years because they can no longer stand the pain. Suicide has crossed my mind  but with my faith and the promises I have made to my wife Patti and sons  Mike and his family  Joseph and his wife  and Kyle  and to many other friends such as Vince  it would be a horrible promise to break. I know there are others suffering even worse episodes from TN.People take their lives because there are few options when it comes to treatment  but these treatments are costly  invasive and often leave patients with only short-term relief. I have agonized over the possibilities.Drugs have worn off with time  so do I let a neurosurgeon drill a hole in my head and cut out blood vessels that touch my trigeminal nerve? Do I let a doctor insert a needle and use a heated electrode to damage nerve fibers? Each of these can lead to stroke-like side effects like a drooping face and slurred speech for the rest of my life. I am a middle-aged man with a successful career as a builder and contractor. The disease has put so many constraints on my life  my finances and my relationships with friends and loved ones. I just want to get back to work and continue doing what I love and being able to take care of my family.Then I found a MIRACLE CURE. Intensive laser therapy worked when I visited a laser clinic in Wisconsin  but I had to drive four hours and take off three weeks of work. Wisconsin has the closest clinic where I can get the right amount of treatment  but I can’t relocate my family  friends or our business. Since this laser treatment center  I have RETURNED TO WORK  NORMAL SPEECH  A POSITIVE ATTITUDE  AND EATING ALMOST WHATEVER I WANT and GAINING MY WEIGHT BACK.So you may ask  is the laser therapy working? YES. The only thing I believe will and has helped my condition is having access to my own laser therapy device  in which I’m able to give myself treatments of up to an hour every day  at home. It’s an expense on top of a pile of medical bills because TN isn’t totally covered by most insurance. Nearly all my treatments have been out of pocket -- $6 000 to 8 000 over the last eight years. Not including missed days of work for treatments and now for the laser machine that is $17 500. Without it  my condition will only worsen. Back to horrific pain episodes  unable to eat and slurred words.I wouldn’t wish this disease on my worst enemy. Instead  I would like to continue laser treatment and educate other TN suffering folks like myself about this little-known  but promising treatment. Please help me raise funds to pay for the laser equipment and the certification needed to give myself daily therapy. I will report back every week with how well it works and hoping to find some relief for those with TN without the use of so much prescription medication  I may never be totally free from them but if I can reduce them my body will be better off. And if I reach my goal  I plan to continue to raise funds for others who hope to seek laser treatment  as well. And again thank you for you generosity.ME  LEFT  WITH MY brother with cancer. That was a good day.ME  CENTER  WITH TWO OTHER VOLUNTEERS during a mission trip to Puerto Rico to help rebuild the island after last year's hurricane. On that mission trip  I got a lot of work done because I was feeling better. Things have gone downhill since and the excruciating facial pain has returned.DAYS OF PAIN: Everyday routines leave me in constant fear of the next attack from trigeminal neuralgia: brushing my teeth  scratching or rubbing the side of my face  yawning or even a gentle breeze can set them off. You can always tell I'm struggling though the pain when I can't shave. It can set off horrific attacks. This day was one of them. I couldn't shave on my way to help teach the deaf sign language during Bible study.HERE ARE TWO VIDEOS you can watch that might help you better understand living with trigeminal neuralgia. Please note that some of the images may be disturbing for some viewers to watch.""",475,15000,6,3,7,94,6
"Support Penny, Shannon &amp; Chris Reid",https://www.gofundme.com/help-penny-shannon-and-chris-reid,6,BOULDER,CO,Penelope Isabella Gabrielle Reid decided to come charging into the world 6 weeks early  at 5:48 am  August 15  2018.  She was born with several abnormalities in her throat which inhibited her ability to breathe on her own once born  called Pierre Robin Sequence. She has been in the NICU at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Denver since August 15th. Penny has an underdeveloped jaw which causes her tongue to lay back blocking her airway  and so she has a tracheostomy to allow her to breathe through a tube in her throat instead of through her mouth.  Penny also has a cleft palate  so she cannot suck hard enough to breast or bottle feed. She has a gastrostomy tube that provides her nutrition (Shannon’s breast milk) through a tube into her stomach. Aside from these abnormalities  Penny is 100% healthy and strong  and she has been growing steadily while showing her spunk and character! She is expected to make a full recovery and grow and develop normally after her many required surgeries…but there is a tough year ahead.Penny had two surgeries within her first month of life (for the trach and the G-tube)  and another surgery was just completed on October 3rd (jaw distraction).  She will be needing about four more surgeries over the next 9-14 months to correct the structural abnormalities and enable her to breathe and eat on her own. The most recent surgery was the big one – the jaw distraction surgery.  They broke her jaw and will gradually extend it over the course of 7-10 days. Then  they leave some hardware in place for a few months while the jaw heals. After that  another two surgeries to take out the hardware  then remove the trach after she proves she can breathe on her own.  Later  she will have cleft palate fixed  and then a final surgery to remove the G-tube when she is eating on her own. Whew!Chris and Shannon are taking it one day at a time in the NICU at Children's Hospital in Aurora  Colorado. They celebrate each tiny milestone and greet every day with positivity and gratitude  however sleep deprived! The Reid family is going to be faced with many expenses during the next several months as well as a reduction in income  as Penny will go home with 24-hour nursing care needed until she is through all her surgeries.  We would like to surround them with our love and support to help ease as much stress as possible.,28991,25000,25,116,219,427,6
Return Reuben&apos;s Manhood...,https://www.gofundme.com/returnreubensmanhood,7,BATONROUGE,LA,"The past two years my scrotum became enlarged slowly until it engulfed all of my genitalia. I became very ill and was sent to a Urologist to have it examined. The solution was to cut it open and check out what was inside. I was told that my doctor didnt know why it occured and i lost my scrotum and alot of penis skin tissue. As of right now  i am essentially a eunuch with enough penis left over to use the restroom. It is a bit depressing at times and i feel like im not a man anymore. Ive been looking into things such as male enhancement and plastic surgery hoping to find a solution. The problem is that these things are very expensive and im at a dead end. I pray that there are some people out there that can understand and/or relate.

Celebrating life in Israel,https://www.gofundme.com/celebrating-life-in-israel,7,Nepean,ON,Hello friends  family and community! My name is Raffi and I am a grade 12 student at Nepean High School in Ottawa  Canada. Last February  my family and I were shocked to hear the news that I had been diagnosed with two malignant brain tumours. This rare form of brain cancer  Germinoma  obviously came as a huge shock and affected my life in ways I would’ve never imagined. After going through brain surgery  chemotherapy  radiation and multiple other ongoing forms of alternative treatments my pathway to recovery is finally nearing an end.          For the past 10 years  I have been lucky enough to go to Camp Gesher  a Jewish summer camp based around the values of social justice  socialism and youth empowerment. Having these experiences has given me a heightened  connection to my jewish identity and throughout my year of treatments my sense of spirituality has only increased. I want to learn more about this part of myself and see where this path brings me. In order to continue exploring this I believe the next step for me is to travel to Israel  a country filled with Jewish history and the stories of my ancestors. This brings me to my main point.       Workshop is a 9-month gap year program in Israel  beginning next September  run by Habonim Dror  the international youth movement my summer camp is affiliated with. This program offers a submersive Israeli experience  living and working on a Kibbutz as well as learning and growing with your group using many different forms of informal education. This program not only will give me the tools that I need to explore myself on a deeper level  but will also be a personal celebration of my battle and the overall winning of my life’s biggest challenge.        As any parents would  my ultra-supportive mom and dad have spent an incredible amount of time and money in order for me to live the best life possible given the circumstances. Due to the past years expenses  I’m unable to afford the trip and gap-year of a lifetime. Any donations would be greatly appreciated and hopefully  with the help of my community  Workshop will become my reality and I will be able to celebrate my life and the things I’ve had to overcome to the fullest!,11408,15000,24,76,145,309,6

Pete Yellowjohn Med Help,https://www.gofundme.com/helppeteyellowjohn,4,POCATELLO,ID,"Pete Yellowjohn  a Traditional Shoshone Elder  Bundle Keeper  and Medicine Man is now in a place of desprately needing our help and support! He has been diagnosed with a rare blood disease called Amyloidosis which is causing his kidneys to fail. They are treating his blood with Chemotherapy once a week in Salt Lake City  which is a 177 mile drive each way from the Ft Hall Reservation Idaho where he lives with his wife Hovia and young son Nabuiginnah (aka Naboo) whom is almost 2 years old. Both of whom he supports and Loves so much. Pete will have a cathader installed in his abdomen soon  and attend a week long class in Salt Lake City to teach him how to start administering Peritoneal Dialysis on himself everyday for 10 hours  with a machine that will be installed in his home. He has had to rearange his home to accomodate the equipment. He is not eligable for Kidney transplant till the blood disorder is taken care of  and insurance won't cover till both kidneys have failed. Needless to say Insurance is not covering all of his medical needs and expenses at this time  nor is Indian Health Services able to provide for him. Pete had to quit his job this week because the kidney disease affects his everyday function  he is extremely fatigued  often home bound  and can no longer work. In his own words \I’m trying to do all this for the sake of my boy! He means a lot to me and I want to be able to watch him grow up !\""From Pete's wife Hovia;I personally want to thank everyone for your love & support for our family at this difficult time of our lives. Pete is the kind of person who doesn't like to ask for anything and will try and figure a way to help himself and to help others & I like to think that is what makes him so special to everyone!!! When we found out about his kidney failure last year (October 2017) we were devastated & felt our world crumble into pieces....but we've learned to pick up the pieces and roll with the punches. We still have a long road ahead of us. Many have asked how much longer it will be until he receives his transplant & that is the same questions we have for Pete's doctors  & all they can tell us is that Pete has to have the Amyloidosis treated FIRST before he can receive a new kidney  because if it is NOT TREATED  his new kidney can be affected in the same manner and he would end up in the same boat he is in now. That is why it is so important they get the Amyloidosis treated first. There are 6 cycles of chemo Pete has to undergo as of now he is in the 4th cycle and at the end of October he will undergo another biopsy to see if the chemo is working & if it is they will continue with 2 more cycles of chemo. Thereafter he can then pursue towards the actual transplant process. So they told us it will probably be about a year.... :( In the meantime since his kidney function dropped to 7% he has to undergo Peritoneal Dialysis for 10 hours a day at home...I know he worries about us (his family) especially little nabuiginnah because he always talks about the things they will do when he gets bigger  the places they will go & the things he wants little Naboo to learn from him...Pete has been such a wonderful father to his son & it breaks my heart to see him worry about the future. So your prayers  your friendship  encouragement & your love for Pete is what's going to help him get through this ordeal. Thank You all for everything from the bottom of my heart!!!

A new Knee for a Preschool teacher,https://www.gofundme.com/a-new-knee-for-a-preschool-teacher,6,SAINTPAUL,MN,Hi everybody!As a preschool teacher  I am used to fund raising  but it sure feels odd to do it for myself. The job I love is hard on my body. In my typical work day I lift and move small chairs  tables  toys and children. I sit on small chairs  I get eye level with three year olds to talk to them  I give lots of hugs that require crouching down to preschooler level  and I lean over to help them with their learning projects. Preschool teaching is not for everyone  but it is an ideal job for me. After years of repeated wear and tear  my knee cartilage is 60-80% destroyed  and sometimes the pain in my knee is due to bone on bone contact. That is bad. I'm working with several doctors to try to figure out how to keep my pain levels down  but the recommendation is for a full knee replacement.Helping young children learn to love themselves and waking their passion for learning is legitimately my life's purpose. I'm very good at it  and I love my job. I'm in my fourth year working for PICA Head Start in Minneapolis; I currently have 30 preschoolers divided between 2 classes  and I'm going to make sure that these children enter kindergarten ready to be successful learners.I am trying to raise funds to cover the cost of my medications  copays  and physical therapy for a complete knee replacement surgery in December.  I will only spend one night in the hospital  but I will miss 5-8 weeks of work.Thank you for reading  and for any contributions you are able to make. Your contributions will allow me to return to the work I love  and to continue to help support myself and my family as I heal.,1300,2000,28,65,19,30,6
Keeping Promises,https://www.gofundme.com/nphtz5-keeping-promises,0,JERSEYCITY,NJ,It is with great sadness and humility that I ask for help in my current situation.  As many of you know or have read  my mom died February 11  2017 from stage 4 lung cancer.  Now a year an a half later  my dad  who was living in Peru  called me on the phone and said he was coughing up blood.  This was how my mom knew she was ill.  I flew him home and he was admitted to the hospital the day he landed.  For nearly two years I cared for mother and did everything I could to make her comfortable and not want anything.  With help from family and friends  my mom lived as best she could while fighting her cancer.  In the end she was surrounded by family and friends and passed in my arms late that evening.  Now my dad and I are more friends then family but I made  promise to my mom on her death bed.  I promised that I would make sure he was ok  that I would not abandon him. She knew no one on her or his side of the family would ever help him  all he has is me.  After 7 days in the hospital he is recovering nicely but slowly.  It was not cancer  but his right lung was infected with pneumonia.  He also has a small hole in his heart and his dementia  which was diagnosed over a year ago  has gotten worse.  After my mom's death I lost everything and I settled in a small place in Jersey City.  Unfortunately  its not large enough for two so he has spent the last 9 days in a hotel.  He will not go to a nursing home here in the US but has agreed to go to a nice nursing home in Peru  where he was born.I was on track to returning to some sort of normalcy and while the nursing home is one I could normally afford  since he did not have health insurance  in just a matter of days I have exhausted a year’s worth of savings and have had to beg for help from friends to help cover what charity care did not and for his medication.  Now I find myself in this situation.  I have exhausted all my savings and although I have closed out my 401K  it will not arrive until the end of October.   I have no more money to keep him here and no money to get him there.  I need help.  I need to raise about $3 000 to get him his flight  his first month payment at the senior center and all his medications for 90 days.  I can handle the rest from that point on between my income and his social security.  I am embarrassed to have to do this but I truly have no other option.  I just want to keep my promise to my mom,1130,3000,26,38,10,19,6

He & his family could really use everyone's thoughts  prayers and support  right about now. Mike has been with DPR Construction for a little over 7 years now. He started out as a Drywall Journeyman  quickly moved into assisting as more of a Field PE & now to Estimator/Project Manager for SPW Interiors – Drywall Team. Mike is a loving & devoted husband to Yvonne Young  and Father of 3 (to Cheyanne  Chance & Aspen )  he is also a brother  uncle  son  friend. I don’t know how many of you know this  but  Mike is also a Military Veteran. He served our country for 11 long years  before getting into construction and eventually making his way to us  here at DPR SPW Interiors Family. Mike is a truly incredible individual & I’m proud to call him my friend. Actually  we call ourselves “Sync buddies” (inside joke). The doctors have said his brain is totally fine  which is nothing short of a miracle. But he does have extensive facial trauma/damage  which will require reconstructive surgeries. His collar bone was shattered  as well as an injury to his shoulder  etc. He’s already undergone 2 surgeries. But  he is not out of the woods yet. Mike & Yvonne just bought their first home a couple years ago. I know many of you want to help. And financial security plays a huge factor in unnecessary stress in times like these. I speak from experience with my father. So  I have created a GoFundMe account  in Yvonne’s name  to aid in collecting donations to help provide some financial assistance & security blanket for their family  as they have a long road ahead & the medical bills are adding up  as well as their normal bills. There is NO DONATION TOO SMALL  I assure you.,17350,15000,33,116,179,174,6
Lincoln&apos;s surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/lincoln039s-surgery,6,Grayson,SK,My sister Debbie & her husband Grant have an amazing boy named Lincoln who at the age of 2  was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. They have seen many physiotherapists  occupational therapists and doctors. After a few years of these types of treatments  they were concerned it was not enough to help Lincoln develop.  In the fall of 2015 my sister and her family began sessions with a practitioner in Saskatoon who practices the Anat Baniel Method (ABM) which is built on teaching the patient the things they do not know they can do.  When they started  Lincoln could only identify with moving one body part  his stomach and could only put 2 words together.  After 3 months with this method  he was speaking full sentences and has learned that he has hips  a back and legs and that he can move them if needed.  The ABM has helped develop & grow Lincoln into a strong little boy.  Due to seeing this amazing progression  his family has continued to travel to Saskatoon every 6 weeks for 1 week duration for 10 sessions (2/day) at a cost of $1 000/wk.  Earlier this year Debbie & Grant learned from the therapists that his muscles needed to be lengthened so that his hips can grow correctly.  After much research they found the best and safest method for Lincoln is in New Jersey  U.S.A.  In New Jersey  the doctor lengthens the muscle lapriscopically by using a needle to put tiny holes in the tendons. Unfortunately in Canada  the surgery requires incisions into the tendons.  Therefore  in order to not hinder any mobility he currently has  they decided to go to NJ this October.Since this type of non-invasive surgery is not offered in Canada  they will have to cover all their costs such as; hotel room  meals  travel & the surgery.  The surgery alone is $22 000.   They would be more than grateful for any financial assistance.Lincoln celebrated his 5th birthday in April &  is an enthusiastic young boy who entered Kindergarten this fall!  We wish him nothing but the best as he has the biggest heart and so do his parents who are willing to go above and beyond for him!,5675,10000,20,57,47,145,6

It may cost roughly up to 400K SGD if using a donor’s stem cell. At this point  it has not been decided which way to go as we wait for results of the subsequent treatments. Due to the high cost  I am also considering and researching  with the help of some friends  on proceeding with the transplant in Manila. If any of you have inputs  related information  or recommendations  please do share with me.As my finances are tight  I am appealing to everyone’s kind hearts for monetary donation that will help to cover the stem cell transplant expense. Please know that any amount is much appreciated and prayers for healing are dearly treasured. I hope that I’ll be given a chance to return the favor some time in one way or another.For those sending in their donation  please drop me a note or any of the contacts I’ve listed below for the account details. As the cost is not yet final  if the total donated amount is more than the actual expense  the excess amount will be divided among the donors. I will either give back the donor’s share or redonate to a charity. I will leave it to each donor to decide on which option he or she prefers.Donations will be accepted through the following banks:PhilippinesBDO - my own accountBPI - c/o Lawrence Arrobang Metrobank - c/o Arcturus Alincastre PNB - c/o Anne Cua-GolongSingaporeUOB - c/o Jinny ChanAustraliaCBA - c/o Karen Santos MejillaYou may contact me or anyone below for the bank account details.Contacts:Family- Marites Villegas  Reuby Almazan SPCP- Karen Santos Mejilla  Paula NepomucenoUP- Lawrence Arrobang  Josephine Ambrocio  Malou De Leon PAL- Anne Cua-Golong  Andrea Hipos  Bang Arevalo  Jonathan Roque  Kat San Diego-MontemayorSabre- Jinny Chan  Jasmine Yeo  Mila BrionesOnce you have completed the transfer  kindly provide the same contact with the following details:Bank:Date/Time of transfer:Amount/Currency:Redonate (Y/N):For those based in the US or in other parts of the world  you may donate via gofundme.

I’m blessed with very loving family and friends and if they’re all I have  it’s ok. In fact  it’s more than enough. I take it as God whispering to my ear to pause and as cliche as it sounds  appreciate the finer things in life— breath of fresh air  smell of freshly brewed coffee in the morning  deep breaths  uncontrollable laughter  hearty home-cooked meals  time spent with family and friends  and the list goes on.I’ve been on a clean  healthy diet for 13 weeks now. Oh how I miss my chips  soft drinks  chocolates and oh yeah  alcohol — things I enjoyed then excessively and not moderately as maybe I should have. I have received a suggestion to drink beer to pass urine to get rid of the toxins from chemo. I wanted to drink beer in that instant but the same friend who passed the message reminded me that water too  can make you pass urine. My new self decided to stick with water.I’ve been living an almost sedentary way of life  far from my then usual adventurous  hyperactive and fast-paced lifestyle. I busy myself mostly with coloring and artworks  Tsumtsum  Vice Ganda YouTube videos  and yes  Netflix. I have word puzzles to do  books to read and a lot of DIY home projects I want to start soon. I occasionally receive visitors in the hospital and at home  some all the way from the Philippines and Australia who never fail to fill me with positive vibes and good energy! Besides my hospital visits  I only go out of the house to hangout with a dear friend and my adorable god-daughter  to the mall or Ikea to buy  in my own standards  necessities  and to church to hear mass.Speaking of church  I’m glad to be an instrument of bringing some friends back to God. I have some friends who haven’t been going to church and praying and now do so to pray for my healing. I also have friends who go to church and offer prayers for me everyday. I am so grateful for my prayer warriors and angels — there are a lot! I have been praying the rosary myself twice daily  along with novenas suggested by family and friends.I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the kindness  generosity and thoughtfulness of everyone aware of my condition. I am truly touched with the support I’m getting from family  friends  present and previous colleagues  bosses  and even acquaintances. I haven’t thanked you all individually but please know that your thoughts  prayers and help keep me going. Thank you! I feel so loved and blessed so much so that thinking about it always brings tears of joy in my eyes.I am thankful that I have a handful of go-to-angels outside Singapore who are always willing to help each time I bug them for favors. I’m used to bugging people for travel plans  parties  events  drinking sessions and other stuff and nonsense  but not really for personal favors. To this day  it still feels a bit uneasy but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.I am eternally grateful for everyone who have been taking care of me in Singapore  my home away from home— my awesome doctors and their teams  nurses  close friends turned family who do so many things for me— feed me with masterchef-level food  join me for my doctor’s appointments  and extend the friendship and support to my sister  among others. I’m also thankful to my sister’s friends who also treat me as family  always ready to help. Most especially  I am forever indebted to my 2 naturally designated caretakers who always keep me company  laugh and cry with me  keep up with my craziness  and bear with my mood swings.I must admit I don’t always feel 100% positive. I do have fleeting downtimes. I sometimes cry because of little things like the difficulty in taking my oral chemo drug cause I find the softgels ugly. My sister volunteered to draw a smiley face on the softgels to make them pretty. The thought of it made me laugh and swallow the no-smiley softgels immediately.I also cry when I miss my dad who passed away 5 years ago. I know he’s one of my angels in heaven as I hear him whisper to me  “Malayo yan sa bituka.” Whenever anyone from the family is sick  he would always utter this phrase. Its literal translation is “It’s far from your intestines.” It means “Don’t worry  you’ll be fine.”My sister flew in from Manila to be with me throughout this journey. I cry with her  wishing our mom is with us to physically comfort us as she always knows what to do in every situation. My mom cannot be with us at this time as she has difficulty travelling due to a stroke 6 years back that left her body half-paralyzed. We keep connected through video chat for now. My mom and sister  I think  are both still stuck in the stage of denial but showers me with their love and support in more ways than one.I'm coping with the usual side effects of chemo like hair fall and tiredness on some days. I’ve lost 5kg after my 1st treatment. Friends say I've lost the unhealthy fats when I started eating healthy. I’m still overweight though  and far from my ideal weight. From my last weigh in  I have regained back 0.5kg. It’s a good sign  I think. As I always say  I’m staying positive and keeping the faith!Thanks again to those who have helped and thanks in advance to those who will be helping. God bless you all!Please feel free to share or forward this post.Sincerely Aileen Almazanaka Ai  Ai-Ai  Len  Orange,3509,100000,10,4,30,227,6

Lori Ollendick Medical &amp; Home Reno.,https://www.gofundme.com/68fn7w0,6,DUBUQUE,IA,On September 4  2018 I had a surgery to repair herniation of my spinal cord at the T3 area at Mayo Hospital. When I woke up from surgery I was unable to move anything below my waist. On September 7  2018 I underwent a second surgery and still woke up with no movement below my waist. I am diagnosed as parapelegic incomplete because I now have some limited movement in my left leg. After my second surgery I transferred to a rehabilitation unit at Mayo. I am currently learning to adapt to life in wheelchair with 3 hrs of occupational therapy and physical therapy every day as I recover from surgery and stabilize resulting medical issues. Preparing for life as parapelegic will require purchasing expensive equipment and aids  some of which insurance will not cover. I will initially discharge to my parents where we are installing a new shower and access ramp. I will be staying there due to needing 24/7 care and will need to sell our split level home and find suitable home that will likely also need renovations. My return to work is uncertain at this time and because I am self-employed  I do not have long or short disability. This is difficult for me to ask for assistance but many friends have asked for a way to help financially. I appreciate all of your support  prayers  positive thoughts  and encouragement.,3842,10000,14,38,44,227,6

She starts her first treatment tomorrow  10-8  at the James Center in Columbus.        The treatment and fight has been and continues to be long and hard  and the financial burden is growing for Brian as he tries to balance caring for his wife and providing for their family.     Several people have asked how they can help and this is only one way.  Prayers  however  are the absolute #1 way to help.  We know that we serve a Risen Savior that can heal and work miracles in our lives.

In 2014 I started preparations for this life changing surgery. I was not able to get things done in a timely matter due to interference from bad actors in my life.Thankfully I'm in a safer healthier place and I've been able to restart this process and everything is scheduled for this year! The procedure itself is covered  but there's still quite a lot of funds needed for food  supplies  bills  and transportation during my lengthy 3 month at-home recovery. My procedure's recovery includes 90 straight days of multiple baths  washes  and bags and bags of biomedical waste. This increases the cost of water usage and garbage pickup for 3 months. These 90 days of recovery require about 3 routines 3 times a day each with their own supply. As well I'm having a trusted and available loved one staying to keep an eye on me and help me with stairs  helping make sure I'm fed and ensuring I'm healthy. They are leaving their dayjob to support me and I sadly can't compensate for the loss of income for the time they are here.I'm looking for your help in covering these costs. I appreciate every view  every share  and every donation. Thank you so much.""",4154,3800,41,109,69,31,6

Tony&apos;s Cancer Battle,https://www.gofundme.com/nea4gu-tony039s-cancer-battle,1,Winnipeg,MB,This is being created to raise money for an IV Vitamin C treatment we are hoping will help Tony's battle with cancer! Here is his story.Tony is a loving father to 4 children and a great husband. Just over year ago Tony went to emergency because he couldnt swallow water. They did an emergency scope and found a large tumor in his esophagus. He went to a specialist and they did multiple biopsies  MRIs  CT scans and PET scans. They determined it was cancer. He needed to have the tumor removed. December they booked the surgery  didn't do chemo or radiation before surgery. They removed the tumor but the cancer had spread to tissue around and to a few lymph nodes. Then he did 6 months of radiation and chemotherapy. We though it was going well. During treatment he noticed a lump was forming in his jaw  they said it's a side effect of treatment. It grew bigger so the did more scans and a biopsy  the cancer had spread to his jaw. The decided radiation for the jaw. During that treatment Tony had symptoms of vertigo. Ringing in his ears  room spinning etc. They did an MRI of his brain. We got devastating news. The cancer had spread badly to his brain. He has multiple tumores in the brain and the protective layer of his brain is also covered in tumors. He's been given a timeline of 1-3 months. He had whole brain radiation 10 treatments and had to stay hospitalized. He is home now  they aren't sure yet if they will also be doing chemo. We find out on the 10th of October.,810,5000,4,16,15,316,6

Mom has been diagnosed with a high grade  aggressive form of sarcoma cancer named UPS. It is extremely rare and we feel blessed that she has a team of sarcoma specialists that have given her an extensive  specialized plan of care. We feel we are in the best hands but these hands are in Denver and Mom's treatment will be aggressive  like her cancer. Inpatient chemotherapy for 3 cycles  21 days each cycle followed by 5 weeks of radiation and ultimately surgery.  Mom starts treatment immediately with port placement and chemotherapy. Obviously this is extremely scary but also stressful as travel expenses and medical out of pocket expenses have already started to build. Any amount helps ease the burden that Mom carries as she starts this journey.,7600,10000,7,76,83,1000,6

Ay&#xFA;dame a Combatir el Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/AyudemosAntonio,3,BALTIMORE,MD,Hola  un gusto saludarles... mi nombre es Antonio Prieto  tengo 56 años y vivo en la ciudad de Valencia en  Venezuela. Actualmente me encuentro desempleado  Recurro a ustedes a través de estas líneas para pedirles un granito de solidaridad por mi salud  ya que hace un par de meses fui diagnosticado con cáncer de recto (Adenocarcinoma de recto superior).Todo comenzó en el mes de Noviembre de 2017  cuando asistí a consulta con mi gastroenterólogo debido a molestias a nivel intestinal  caracterizado por excesiva y constante diarrea con hematoquecia (sangrado rectal). En base a dichos síntomas mi médico me prescribe la realización de una colonoscopia  de la que resulta el hallazgo de un tumor a 11cm de la unión ano rectal.Posterior a ello fui referido para la realización de una cirugía (realizada el 15 de Diciembre de 2017)  en la cual posterior a la evaluación fui sometido a una resección anterior baja con colostomía (en la que fue removido el tumor y puesto en condición de evacuar a través de vía externa). Para esa oportunidad no me prescribieron adyuvancia (quimioterapia y/o radioterapia) a pesar de haber resultado un tumor maligno en la biopsia que fue realizada.Para el mes de junio de 2018 al asistir a mi correspondiente control con la finalidad de coordinar mi cirugía para restablecer mi proceso de evacuaciones por las vías normales. Una vez Iniciados los estudios preoperatorios  entre los cuales cabe destacar la colonoscopia  estudio en el cual se evidenció la existencia de restos de tumor (el cual no había sido extraído en su totalidad)  se hace nuevamente estudios patológicos a la muestra extraída  cuyo resultado del diagnóstico fue de Adenocarcinoma de Recto Superior  razón por la cual se suspende dicha operación.Creí haber superado el cáncer  con la cirugía a la que fui sometido en diciembre de 2017  fui recuperando mi estado de ánimo  apetito y peso (había perdido 16 kilos)  Al recibir la mala noticia que todavía estaban presentes células cancerígenas en mi cuerpo  fue una conmoción tan grande tanto para mí como para mi familia. En vista de ese último diagnóstico fui referido nuevamente al Oncólogo  quien me prescribió Tratamiento de Quimioterapia esquema XELOX (JULIO 2018).Para todos es de dominio público la situación de crisis hospitalaria que atraviesa nuestro país Venezuela  donde hay escasez de medicamentos y el alto costo de los tratamientos para eliminar esta enfermedad. Y peor aún la falta de equipos necesarios para dichos tratamientos. Con el apoyo de familiares y amigos  se logró conseguir parte de los medicamentos pero debido a que los  recursos no fueron suficientes no se  pudo obtener  la totalidad de los mismos ya que ameritan ser traídos del exterior al no haber disponibilidad en el país  razón por la cual se ha mantenido retrasado el inicio del no del tratamiento  trayendo como consecuencia el crecimiento del tumor (ahora esta hasta el recto medio). Dado el acelerado crecimiento y extensión de las células malignas debo ser sometido a Radioterapia (28 sesiones) y Quimioterapia oral de forma simultánea  después de esto debo ser  intervenido quirúrgicamente  para restituir el tránsito intestinal previa recesión del área afectada. Finalizando con nuevamente otro ciclo de Quimioterapia posterior a la cirugía.Por todo lo antes expuesto estaré eternamente agradecido con el aporte que realicen por muy pequeño que sea  en pro de recuperar mi salud y llevar una vida plena en compañía de mi familia  que día a día me acompaña y me da el soporte para no decaer y continuar con esta lucha.Todo lo recolectado será destinado a cubrir los costos de Radioterapia y a la compra de los tratamientos de Quimioterapia (medicamentos faltantes)  igualmente para los costos de los estudios que deben realizarse durante dichos tratamientos (Tomografías  Colonoscopia  ecografías  entre otros)  sufragar los gastos médicos correspondientes y cirugía de restauración de mis vías intestinales. Lo cual asciende alrededor del monto de 5000$. Las medicinas actualmente  requeridas  son:12 ampollas de 100 mg de Oxaliplatino.2 caja de tabletas de Capecitabina.De antemano  muchas gracias y que Dios les retribuya grandemente en salud a todos y cada uno de ustedes. No esta de mas pedirles que oren por mi pronta recuperación. Un gran abrazo!Antonio Prieto,1700,5000,10,34,31,237,6

Medical Expenses for Jakob,https://www.gofundme.com/94hcu-funeral-amp-medical-expenses,5,SAFFORD,AZ,On October 4th 2018 Brianna  Jakob  & their cousin were leaving band practice and heading to the homecoming bonfire where they were in an accident. Their cousin was able to escape the vehicle and call for help... Tragically Brianna (18) passed away a short time after being airlifted to the hospital due to her injuries in Safford  Az. She was a beautiful  bright  talented  and witty young girl with the world at her feet. She graduated last year from Safford Highschool with honors. She could play any instrument she picked up and had a passion for it. She was attending  college classes at Eastern Arizona College when her life was tragically cut short. Jakob (15) was also airlifted to Banner Hospital in Tucson  Az where he is still in the Intensive care unit.  He suffered multiple injuries and was on a ventilator for 4 days. He has already has one surgery on his leg  and will undergo more surgery's to repair broken bones in his face. They also just found out Monday evening that he will permanently be blind in one eye. He is improving daily  but has a long road to recovery ahead of him. He is a student at Safford Highschool and plays the trumpet in the marching band. This is a devastating  loss for this family and community. As you can imagine the cost they are incurring during this will be astronomical  They did not have life insurance for Brianna and although they do have medical insurance they will not pay for all of the costs they will incur. Anyone that is looking for ways to help Cheryl out during this time here's how! You can also make donations to Vining Funeral Home in Safford  Az. Cheryl and the Family would like to thank each of you for you prayers  thoughts  and everything that yall have done for her and her family during this time.  Please continue to pray for Jake and a speedy recovery for him  and also for Cheryl   Christian  and the rest of the family and friends who will need them daily in the days ahead.,5144,50000,7,10,81,1000,6
Make Me Smile,https://www.gofundme.com/s7ku8g-make-me-smile,6,KAPAA,HI,Our son Keola was born with a cleft lip and partial palate.  When he was three months old  he had surgery to repair his lip and all went very well.  We've been very fortunate that his hearing  speech and many of the other issues associated with cleft lip and palate did not affect Keola.  He became a very active and social little boy.  Now he is nine years old (about 5 years old in that photo) and he needs his second (and last) surgery to repair his palate.  They are going to take a piece of bone from his hip and put it in his mouth.  His mobility will be limited for awhile which will be hard  for a normally very active boy.  He enjoys playing football  riding his bike  taking care of his little sister  and hanging out with friends.  He is scheduled for surgery on Halloween  but we are having trouble coming up with the funds.   His surgeon and all surgeons on Oahu who do this type of surgery do not participate with insurance so very little will be covered.  Part of the airplane flights are covered to get us from Kauai to Oahu  but we also have the additional expenses of car rental and hotel while he stays in the hospital.  After his orthodontist bills to prepare his mouth for surgery and welcoming a baby girl to our family this June  our finances are stretched to the limit.  His surgeon's bill is going be about $5 600 after insurance reimbursement in addition to hospital costs.  Your help would greatly be appreciated.,970,3000,16,32,11,46,6

I have been struggling and quite frankly drowning financially since my accident with zero income whatsoever. I have filed for disability but the wait is minimum 6 months.

During my stay in the hospital while fighting for my life  my dead beat mother got guardianship  even though I had expressed multiple times prior to the accident I did not want her to get it and had selected someone else for it. So now I have to hire an attorney to fight for my son back as well. I lost EVERYTHING in this wreck  my home  my vehicle  my job  my son  even my ability just to walk. If you find it in your heart to help and are able  I cannot thank you enough. I have always been the helper  not the helped and have enojoyed helping people. But I just cannot weather through this storm alone. God bless you all and thank you so  so much. God saved me for a reason that day and I just want my boy back home permanently and my life back as much as humanly possible.,370,10000,3,4,5,185,6
Help the Heimanns - Cancer &amp; Heart,https://www.gofundme.com/help-the-heimanns-cancer-amp-heart,9,WICHITA,KS,Catholic author  blogger  and theologian Jean M. Heimann continues to inspire us all. After earning two Master’s degrees  working as a psychologist with both children and adults for many years  writing three books  and serving in ministry for more than twenty-five years  Jean suddenly became ill and was diagnosed with colon cancer. She is being treated with chemotherapy and radiation for the cancer for a total of two months.In addition to cancer  Jean is in urgent need of a hip replacement  which is causing her acute pain. The sole remedy for this ailment is hip surgery  which had to be postponed due to the unexpected cancer diagnosis. Thus  she has considerable difficulty walking and is in constant pain. Within the past few months  she has seen seven doctors and undergone numerous tests and procedures for both her hip and her cancer.At the same time  Jean’s husband Bill suffers from A-Fib and is in need of robotic heart surgery for a leaky mitral valve. Bill also has been active in ministry for 30+ years. He worked full-time for many years as a manufacturing engineer and as a plant manager. The couple had a small nest egg for retirement  which was stolen from them by a former parishioner.Bill’s last full-time position as a manufacturing engineer was eliminated in order to save the company money during the stock market crash. Bill has worked at a number of part-time jobs to earn money. However  he was without full-time work for nearly three years. Now  at retirement age  Bill works as a professional driver 2-3 days per week. He will need to take time off from his job in order to recover from his heart surgery.The Heimann family needs funds to pay for both their medical expenses (not covered by insurance)  and for their living expenses.,4520,10000,15,45,44,196,6
Haylee White&apos;s Healing Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/haylee-white039s-healing-journey,7,BROKENARROW,OK,Friends of the White family have decided to link arms with them to help  Haylee along her healing journey! To share a little about her story: Haylee's journey with Chronic Lyme began 2 1/2 years ago. But a definitive diagnosis was not made until January 2018  after many different doctors and tests were done. There are no Lyme specialists in OK  so her Lyme dr is 5 hrs drive away in Ashland  MO. She began rigorous antibiotic treatment in January - first with oral meds which her body could not keep down. Then with 2 shots a day  which her body did not respond to. In August  her dr started her on IV antibiotics and so far she is responding well to those. The Lyme antibioitic treatment lasts for 18-24 months  they are currently about 12 months into it. Since moving to IV antibiotics  the insurance company will only cover a select few medications. For her protocol  some are covered and some are not. This has been a long journey for Haylee and her family. Last year alone they spent $10 000 trying to get a clear diagnosis. This year  the cost has been almost as much because of limited insurance coverage for Chronic Lyme Disease.Funds raise will be used to cover:IV meds & other meds used to treat the side effects of Lyme not covered by insuranceVisits to Lyme dr and other dr  hospital visists and tests not covered by insuranceHome Health Care for picc line,1307,7500,10,17,17,128,6

Join Kristi&apos;s Fight,https://www.gofundme.com/kristihoward,1,Schertz,TX,Kristi found a small bump in December  but it turned out to be nothing.  Several months later  the standard follow up appointment revealed an 8 cm mass in her left breast that had already spread to at least 5 lymph nodes. Kristi has stage 3 breast cancer.As it normally happens  this was an unexpected turn of events. Kristi is only 33 and has an energetic two year old and a witty mine-craft-loving five year old. She expected to spend the rest of 2018 worrying about packing creative lunches for her new kindergartner and chasing around a toddler  but now she is planning on starting chemotherapy within 2 weeks of finding out that she has stage 3 breast cancer. She is going to tackle the chemotherapy treatments over the next five months  and then she will go into surgery for the full removal of her left breast. On average  the medications alone can cost tens of thousands of dollars  not including the doctor visits  scans  surgeries  and other unexpected expenses that can add up quickly.  But as many of you know  the costs of cancer treatment extends well beyond the initial treatment and can last for at least five years post surgery for additional medications  treatment cycles   and follow up scans. If you are able to financially support Kristi and her family during this time  your generosity is met with sincere gratitude. Most importantly  the family is asking for your prayer  your faith in God's ability to move mountains beyond our understanding  and encouragement for both Kristi  Brock  and their two young boys. If you'd like to help in any other way  please let us know. Thank You.,4263,30000,12,14,59,355,6
Tamar Gonsalves and Family,https://www.gofundme.com/tamar-gonsalves-and-family,9,CLAYTON,CA,As most of you know Tamar and Andrew's baby girl  Tate  was born with gastroschisis which is a birth defect of the abdominal wall where the baby's intestines are found outside of the body.

Chris Schaller Family Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/chris-schaller-family-fund,8,CARLSBAD,CA,October 10  2018Our good friend Chris Schaller has been battling terminal cancer valiantly for several years  living well beyond the expectations of the medical community.  Chris has shown amazing spirit and faith through it all  but the battle has taken a toll on him and his family in so many ways.  I am writing today to give an update on Chris and his family  and to ask for your help.Chris’s cancer started in his lip  moved to his neck  and today is in his lungs and bones.  He has tried many different treatments and currently is holding fairly steady with the aid of an immunotherapy regime.   His prognosis remains terminal  but with Chris’ spirit  many prayers  and continued medical advancement  the outlook could change.  Without giving up hope  Chris and Diane must plan for a future without him.One of the harsh realities of getting cancer is the severe financial impact it wreaks on a family.  Chris has been a successful businessman who always shared his resources generously. Unfortunately  Chris’ business was the first casualty of his disease.  Without Chris’ time and talent available due to his treatments  business operations suffered and the bank shut it down  enforcing personal loan guaranties against Chris.  The series of events that followed pushed Chris into personal bankruptcy  wiping out all his family’s savings.  Recently Chris’ business bank foreclosed on his home  and the Schallers must now relocate by November 4th.  Chris is now without financial resources  without ability to borrow  and without ability to earn a living; the dire situation notwithstanding  Chris remains positive.I’ve spoken with a few of you about the Schaller’s short and long term financial needs  and have answered a few questions worth sharing with all.  Some have asked about family resources and/or insurance available to help. Without going in to great detail  there are very limited financial resources available today or expected in the future from either Chris’s or Diane’s family.  On the matter of potential life insurance cash value or proceeds  the answer is complicated. There is a policy  but it was used as collateral against a loan and therefore has been attached by the bank. The bankruptcy trustee allowed the bank’s claim to stand  so there will be no proceeds remaining for the Schaller family unless this ruling is changed which is unlikely.Through all of this  Chris has been reluctant to ask for help  striving to find a way forward on his own. Unfortunately  Chris is now without many options and he needs the help of his friends. Many people have expressed interest in raising money for the Schallers to help with medical and living expenses  so we are launching a campaign to do just that.  All money raised through this GoFundMe campaign will be deposited in the Chris Schaller Family Irrevocable Trust account and used solely for the benefit of the Schallers.  The purpose of the trust is to protect donated funds from the bankruptcy trustee. After all bankruptcy matters are resolved  the funds can be distributed directly to the family.  In the meantime  the trust will pay rent  health insurance  medical expenses  and living expenses on the Schaller’s behalf.The Schaller’s needs are significant and ongoing. Importantly  there is an urgent need to raise funds for the Schallers due to their requirement to move out of their home by November 4th.   We have all watched Chris over the years be the guy who reaches out to everyone  gets people together  and works for the greater good.  If he were the healthy one right now  he’d be leading the charge to help.  Let’s do what we can now for Chris and his family in their time of need and transition.  And let's all keep the Schallers in our prayers.,27500,100000,37,28,44,29,6

Shawn&apos;s FTM Top Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/shawns-ftm-top-surgery,6,MIAMI,FL,Hi! My name is Shawn and I am a 25 year old animal lover  writer and trans man. I struggle with severe gender dysphoria  which has caused me a lot of emotional distress and problems. I have been transitioning socially  but because of my appearance  many people don't see me as male. When I look in the mirror  I don't recognize myself. I just want to feel like myself  and feel comfortable and happy with what I see in the mirror. Top surgery will change my life for the better and it is the next step in my transition. I have worked hard to make the progress I have made and I want to keep moving forward. Unfortunately  top surgery is expensive. After rent  bills and other expenses  it has been extremely difficult to save any money for my surgery. My insurance will not cover any part of it. Every penny I raise through this campaign will go towards my surgery  which will cost me between $8 125 and $8 400 in total. The surgical fee will be $6 500  and the hospital and anesthesia fee will be between $1 625 and $1 900. I will be going to a local surgeon so there won't be any transportation or lodging expenses. If you are able to donate even the smallest amount  I would be incredibly grateful. Even just sharing my campaign would be so helpful to me. Thank you so much for reading and for any help you are able to give.,445,8400,13,5,10,60,6
A Helping Hand For A Loving Wife,https://www.gofundme.com/68g6hso,0,BRAINTREE,MA,My name is Steve; next to me in the photo is a person that I love so very dearly and means the world to me. My wife Katie was just diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Currently we are looking into getting a second opinion of course  but the current treatment option is a complete hysterectomy... this said it means we will be unable to have our own children; a dream we have wanted to achieve ever since we got married. At the moment; she works feverishly at Target making ends meet while I take care of my mother and dog (which is 14 years old and in her final days). If Katie is laid up for any amount of time; it will cut deep into our finances making it nearly impossible to pay all our bills let alone the high medical expenses we are dealing with in regards to our dearly beloved pet whom we’ve had for nearly half of our lives. The purpose of this GoFundMe is not to milk any of this or to make it seem she is in immediate dire need  but to become a backup plan just in case she needs time off to heal emotionally  mentally  and physically as this is already starting to take it’s toll on us all. We just want to be able to not worry about these important  yet smaller  issues while we try to figure out our lives moving forward. All we ask is a little help  be it in the form of donating or spreading the word  so that we may enjoy life without added dark rain clouds hovering over us. If there are any rainy clouds then this would become a safety umbrella so we may get through the storm.,250,3500,6,7,6,81,6

No gift is too small and any contribution will help lift some of the burden of medical costs for this young family and their little warrior  #asherthebraveFeb 2019 update from Asher’s Mommy:February 14th we had Asher's monthly eye exam under anesthesia  6 month MRI  and hearing test.His MRI showed the cancer was contained in his eye.His eye exam showed tumor growth.They made an incision in his right eye and did cryo therapy on the tumor. With 2 little stitches on his right eye.They did laser therapy on the left eye.The doctor doctor didn't feel comfortable waiting 4 weeks so they scheduled us to come back for an eye exam in 2 weeks on the 28th.We talked about options with the doctors. I was obviously a mess. To say the least. Feburary 15th Asher got his super cool hearing aids. (Due to his hearing loss from the chemotherapy) Papa picked a super cool orange and black ear mold.That's been interesting. He's REAL quick at pulling them out and REAL wiggly when putting them in. On January 10th Asher got his broviak (central line) removed and on January 13th (Ben's 30th birthday) Asher had his first real bath.Feburary 21st they called us and told us they wanted to put in a port and most likely start chemo on the 28th after his eye exam. February 28th THE RIGHT TUMOR RESPONDED WELL TO THE CRYO. THE LEFT TUMOR RESPONDED WELL TO THE LASER.HIS PORT WENT IN FINE.We will start a different chemotherapy today for 5 days in a row. I ask you to please keep our baby in your thoughts and prayers.The last 2 weeks have been hell. But to learn his tumors responded well to his last treatment  Jesus  my heart is so full.p.s. Asher loves the itsy bitsy spider. Patty cake is a second favorite but HATES rolling it up  OBSESSED WITH BOUNCING (shoutout to our awesome neighbor Hollie for the bouncer) and has 2 teeth now! His hair just started coming in and I'm sure will be gone again soon  he also started crying and growling at the same time.

They cleared Ben day 2 with flying colors. He was so fast at setting up the pump  priming the line  and giving him the right meds in the right order the nurse was so impressed.

Tomorrow is October 9th  our first year wedding anniversary. And I've been a complete wreck for 3 months. Benjamin  after Asher was diagnosed I wouldn't eat. BUT YOU went to work  came home from work  made the most delicious meals and MADE me eat. MADE me pump so YOU could feed the baby. Changed so many diapers without ever complaining. PREMADE meals so I didn't have to think about eating. You let me cry for months  you always smiled and told me all the amazing things that Asher was going to accomplish in his life. Over and over and over again. You would tell me the most amazing stories about what we would teach him and how he was meant to change the world and affect other people in his life in the most profound ways. In September you told me you believed our son could be a pilot or a sniper  I believed you. I do believe you. YOU GAVE ME HOPE when I was empty. You gave me strength when I didn't think it existed. You let me be mad at the world and then reminded me how blessed we were. You made me feel safe when I felt like I was going to lose my baby. You reminded me everyday that I was a good mom when I wasn't strong enough to be.

Move Mountains for Angel,https://www.gofundme.com/hrsqh-move-mountains-for-angel,0,SHAWNEE,KS,"A couple weeks ago  Angela (who we lovingly refer to as a \Mom\""  \""Grandma\""  \""Aunt Angel\""  \""Sis\""  and \""Angel\"") was t-boned at an intersection when the other driver ran a red light. Angel was removed from her vehicle (which was completely crushed on the driver's side) with the help of firefighters. She was rushed to the emergency room with extensive injuries  including a collapsed lung  torn liver  and many (many  many) fractures to her pelvic bones  ribs  and sacrum. Angel was in ICU for several days before undergoing a long surgery and beginning a very long recovery period. The Recovery Process: Doctors have ordered Angel to refrain from putting any weight on her pelvic bones for at least 12 weeks (i.e.  no walking)  but this doesn't include the additional months of rehab she has ahead of her. Not being mobile is a big challenge for our active Angel! She's the type to mow her own yard  tend to the seemingly wild pumpkins that are growing in her background  play football with her grandkids  and so much more. Angel also works an additional part-time job where she is on her feet for several hours. This is not going to be possible over the coming months and will take a massive hit to her income (her part-time work is unfortunately not covered by any short-term disability). Angel Needs Our Help: The major concern at the moment is making sure Angel has a safe place to live (i.e.  wheelchair accessible) and the ability to pay her monthly bills. As many of you know  Kansas insurance maximums have a limit that will surely be below Angel's already extensive medical bills. Angel's medical costs likely already far exceed what she is expecting to get back with insurance. We're not holding our breath for that money to cover other major expenses. Short-term disability will cover part of Angel's lost wages in her full-time job  but none of her part-time job (where she works nearly every weekend).We're raising $10 000 to offset the burden for Angel. Here's how she will use it: · Help cover the cost of Angel's living expenses (those not covered by her short-term disability) over the next 6 months· Help cover the material costs for getting her house wheelchair accessible (we've got the man power!)· Help soften the burden of costs that go above and beyond the insurance claims.Angel's The Best: Angel is independent and generous. She raised 4 daughters on her own and rarely asked for help. She earns her own money  spends it wisely  and does what she can to help others. It's our turn to help her. She works two jobs  has 10 grandkids  one great grandson  four daughters and many nieces and nephews.She's the rock in our family. The quiet but hilarious one who always knows how to throw in a sarcastic joke at the PERFECT time.  Like that one time when we passed her yummy drink around at a wedding. She came back and caught us...this picture below has been shared so many times in our family: How you can help: Any amount (even just $5) can help tremendously. If you can't help financially (we definitely get that) but want to help in other ways  here's what Angel would love: - Words of encouragement. Leave them in the comments and we'll make sure she gets them.  - Great book recommendations. She loves fiction /mystery and will have some extra time to read. - Yummy and easy recipes that Team Angel can whip up for her so she's not eating hospital food / rehab food nonstop. - Fun crocheting patterns (she usually sticks to blankets / scarves - but new designs are always welcome!).- Anything that helped you personally get through a tough injury. Everyone's journey is different but your tips / words of wisdom can help. :)""",2645,10000,13,26,44,257,6
Justice  For Fleming,https://www.gofundme.com/fightforFleming,7,LANSING,MI,#FightforFlemingBullying causes a need for Tyler to seek justice. Tyler is a 15 year old bi-racial sophomore that attends A high school just outside of Lansing. He is more than just your typical teenager  he plays an active role helping his single mother raise his two younger siblings. He is also an honor  student who wrestles  runs track  and plays varsity football. Now he is in desperate need of your help. Tyler became a victim of bullying by a group of girls with a personal vendetta against him which started with a Snapchat message   “I’m going to make your school year hell  wait and see.” This bullying has resulted in a horrendous false accusation to authorities that could cost Tyler his future. The accusation is Not defendable because she claims it was a private conversation between herself and Tyler. As a result  Tyler was suspended from school for 15 days while the school “investigated” the allegations which were turned over to police. The result: a felony charge!Not only has this effected him personally and emotionally  it has also taken a toll on his family. His legal defense is $10 000. Unfortunately  emotional support is not enough to help Tyler and his family through this difficult time. Tylers mom is a single mother of three  currently on disablity from work. Finances are tight  your help would be greatly appreciated.,1873,10000,5,19,14,246,6

Change for Charlie,https://www.gofundme.com/znre5d-change-for-charlie,9,HOCKLEY,TX,We always hear about single Moms who do whatever they can to raise their children on their own with or without child support  but how often do you hear that about single Dads? Not often   Charlie is one of those men who raised his son on his own  making ends meet and providing all he could for his son.  Benjamin is 19 years old now serving our country in the United States Navy.  Me being Charlie’s friend of about 34 years would like to ask you for your support and let him know he’s not on his own.  As with most people in the construction business  Charlie is a sub-contractor and does not have health insurance. On September 30th Charlie had a VERY freak accident while working on a house that was severely damaged by a bad water leak. Charlie was working on replacing a sub floor when a walk board did not support him  causing him to loose footing  landed straddling a 2x10 board. Immediate and excruciating pain was felt quickly   he was taken to the ER and after several tests found out he has suffered Urethral trauma (torn urethra tube). Because of this injury a catheter is  being used until the swelling & pain has subsided. It’s painful to walk  sit  move  anything  which makes it impossible to work. Life still happens...bills  rent  car insurance  light bill  food and basic necessities  not to mention impending hospital bills. Charlie requires a second surgery repairing his urethra tube  a date for this surgery has not been set as of this post.  There is no time frame yet as to when Charlie will be able to return to work  we are trying to help him out with everyday expenses and surgery costs. Charlie is a prideful man who has a very small family support system...friends/family are helping where they can with transportation to and from doctor appointments etc... Please  whatever you can spare to help this good man stay somewhat on his feet is greatly appreciated!I will post updates on his progress.Thank you and God Bless  Shannon,1480,5000,5,30,11,194,6

Help to cover Matt&apos;s medical costs,https://www.gofundme.com/help-to-cover-matt039s-medical-costs,6,Melbourne,VIC,Our legendary friends Matt Davis and Courtney Mills were involved in a motorbike accident in Bali on the weekend.  Matt and Courtney were badly injured and are lucky to escape with their lives.  Courtney is out of the hospital and is doing well.  Sadly  Matt hasn't been so fortunate and has had to undergo surgery for his injuries.  The doctors in Bali have informed him that he may require further  high risk  surgery to release air trapped in his skull.  Matt has been given some hope that his second surgery may not be needed if the air decreases over the coming days/weeks.  However  he is not permitted to leave the hospital or fly unless  and until  the air trapped in his skull is reduced - whether this occurs by surgery or naturally over time.    The hospital bills so far exceed $30k and those costs increase by around $1000 each day that Matt spends in hospital.  Doctors in Australia have advised Matt to avoid the second surgery due to its high risk.  So  costs will increase daily as Matt anxiously waits for the air in his skull to decrease.   As many of you would know  biking accidents in Bali are not covered by travel insurance...and the costs incurred by Matt to date are huge.We are asking for donations to help cover the cost to get Matt better.  Matt was hesitant to agree to a Gofundme Page being the guy that he is....but we convinced him how much everyone will want to help when they know what he's going through.  Every little bit counts and we know how grateful Matt will be for your help and support.  Let's band together to help ease Matt's financial burden so he can focus on getting better.Sending so much love to you both Matt and Court xxxx,35810,45000,21,80,362,1000,6

Freedom Trax for Paris&apos; Freedom,https://www.gofundme.com/freedom-trax-for-paris039-freedom,7,Kilmore,VIC,￼IMAGINE being a kid or a teenager and being told you have a degenerative muscle disease which will lead to a loss of muscle co-ordination  fatigue  vision impairment  hearing loss  slurred speech and then a serious heart condition and premature death - this is Friedreich Ataxia. 1 in every 30 000 affected. 1 in 90 are carriers. No treatment or cure. Paris ability to walk unaided has slowly declined since she was diagnosed at age 6. She is now nearly 14 years old and is reliant upon a wheelchair. Paris favourite thing to do is go to the beach  and as you can imagine getting a wheelchair over the sand is impossible on your own (and nearly impossible with help lol)  Paris enjoys camping with her family and friends and just being outdoors. As her parents it nearly kills us having to watch Paris watch others do what she can't. We just want her to be able to do what everyone else can. So a little while ago I was tagged on facebook for a video of this thing called a Freedom Trax ( https://freedomtrax.com). I was soooo excited!!! This piece of equipment was the answer to all the mobility issues Paris had!!! Imagine... she could attend Year 8 surf camp and actually be able to go down on the sand...... Christmas camping at the beach would be a whole new enjoyable (without the added stress and tears from Paris as we try to get her over the sand) experience for her.... sports on the oval at school..... bush camping by the river  weekend walks with the dogs...... gees the list just goes on of all the ways this equipment would enrich her (and for that matter our lives).  So I contacted the US supplier and found an Aussie supplier. After consultation with Paris' physio at RCH Melbourne we managed to get one of these Trax down to Victoria for Paris to have a go at...... I'm not sure If i can put the video on here but I'm going to try. OMG!! This thing is AMAZING to say the least!!!!! I posted the video on my FB of Paris trialling this Trax just to show how AWESOME it is and then my friends started rallying.......... within 1 hour $4K had been pledged by two local businesses (AT&T Trenching and Chuck-E-Electrical). And now here I am setting up GoFundMe.  SWEP funding will not fund this piece of equipment as it does not fall into one of their categories and NDIS has not started in our region yet.  In this early stage things are moving quite quickly and I'm trying to get my head around things  but with a small committee of individuals we will also by attempting to have some fundraising days to meet the cost of the Trax. The Trax can be viewed on their Facebook page (just search for Freedom Trax) or on their website  www.freedomtrax.com. The cost is $6700 USD with an approx cost of $1K USD postage. This equals around $11 000 AUD. I am awaiting a final quote from the mobility aides supplier in Bendigo and direct from the supplier in the US and will post details as they become available.We crowdfunded around 4-5 years ago for an all terrain rollator that we had imported from Europe (its called a Trionic Veloped)  and that was also an amazing piece of kit! Paris had soooo much use out of it.... up until around 3 months ago when she could no longer keep herself upright. We are currently awaiting information from Paris' FA specialists of a child with FA who would currently benefit from being able to own this rollator so they can still access all areas of their playgrounds  parks and ovals etc. so the generosity you guys have shown in the past can be paid forward to another kid who is suffering this horrible disease. Thanks for reading our story!!! Thanks for everything!! The support we receive from our family  friends and community is just mind blowing and from the bottom of our hearts THANK YOU everyday for the love and support you guys give over and over again!!!! xxxxxxxxx￼,7895,11000,10,72,45,375,6
Help Karyssa fight breast cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-karyssa-fight-breast-cancer,6,PULASKI,WI,"In 2015 my daughter Karyssa tested positive for BRCA1 gene. Her doctors told her to hold off on any surgery and start having six month check ups when she turns 25 years old. Now being 25  wanting a reduction  knowing she was BRCA1 positive  and knowing she would no longer be on her current insurance once she turns 26. Karyssa met with her doctors and decided it was best for her to have a double mastectomy with reduction reconstruction. Surgery took place July 9th 2018. Unfortunately lab reports came back with a tumor that wasn’t seen on her pre op MRI. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma  Triple Negative. The same exact aggressive cancer I  her mother  had. Devastating to anyone but especially a young woman trying to be proactive and her family. Even her doctors were shocked. Everyone was glad she listened to her gut and having the surgery turned out being the best decision. Who knows what would have happened if she waited six months or even a year. Karyssa was so bruised from the first surgery that her skin started to die and she had to have debridement surgery on July 23rd  her implants were replaced by tissue expanders. She was devastated because this added more time she couldn’t lift  care for  or cuddle with her 11 month old babe Nora. Once her drains from the second surgery were taken out she unfortunately had another set back. MRSA staph infection. So yet another surgery took place August 23rd to take out the expanders and clean the area. Karyssa thought she was healed and her port placement was scheduled for September 17th but by then it seemed the infection may have come back. She’s since been told she has cellulitis of the chest wall  MRSA could be back and is currently being treated by Infectious Disease. With all of these setbacks Karyssa has been out of work a lot longer than expected  her one surgery has turned into 3 and 3 more to come. Her husband Ian continues to work hard for their family but without Karyssa’s full income they’re needing help with monthly bills  groceries and the unexpected medical bills that just keep coming. Karyssa will have to pay for Cobra until the end of the year because it makes more sense financially even though it is very expensive. As of right now if she’s clear of infection she will start her 12 week chemotherapy treatment October 9th  2018. This will mean she will be out of work a while longer and then have to worry about any reconstruction surgery such as getting expanders put back in and later implants. So much more recovery.Karyssa and Ian are not the kind to ask for help but are there whenever they’re needed to lend a helping hand. My daughter has remained positive and refuses to be defeated by cancer. She is determined to beat this and be around to watch her own daughter grow. Any contribution towards these three wonderful humans having to go through the worst possible situation is so appreciated. Let's help Karyssa  Ian and Nora with the financial burden of this situation so they can focus on healing  recovering and saying: \F YOU  CANCER!\""""",1615,20000,8,8,27,275,6
Get Well Kirill,https://www.gofundme.com/get-well-kirill,0,115142,RU,Thank you for visiting this gofundme page about Russian freeride mountain biker Kirill Benderoni. We  his family and friends  will keep this page up to date and will post news about his recovery regularly. You will find a detailed account of Kirill's accident and more information about his person in the paragraphs below.#GETWELLBENDERONIStatus quoOn september 21st Kirill Churbanov - more commonly known as Benderoni - had a severe accident while riding on his home trails close to Moscow. He overshot one of his big backcountry gap jumps  broke his collarbone upon crash landing and was immediately knocked out by the impact. Kirill wore a fullface helmet as well as a Leatt brace. He didn't regain consciousness and when he was delivered to a hospital about five hours later he was put in an artificial coma to help deal with his injuries. He was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury and as of now  it is unclear how the future will look for him. A couple of days ago  Kirill woke up from coma and can follow persons with his eyes  reacts to touches and being talked to but cannot (yet) move again or talk or communicate in any other way. Kirill has health insurance in Russia  which is one of the few good news - unfortunately  the insurance will only cover a basic rehabilitation program which will not be sufficient for Kirill's type of injury. This is why we want to raise funds to be able to place him in a good medical program  specific for his needs. Any donations received will go directly to Kirill's family and will strictly be used for his treatment. In case there is some amount left  it will be donated to a charity of a similar kind. We thank you in advance for your help!About KirillKirill is a freeride mountain bike rider from Moscow  Russia. He has been making a name for himself in the international scene by uploading videos and photos of his riding in Russia and Europe. At one point  his riding earned him a spot in the qualifier for Red Bull Rampage in Utah  the pinnacle event of the sport! Despite this extreme side  Kirill is a mild mannered and calm character. He builds and plays his own instruments - some of them even made it into his mountain bike edits ;)Growing up in a country where mountain biking wasn't a part of popular culture - or on any kind of public radar at all  to be honest - Kirill didn't have an easy career path laid out for him. Although his riding skills are undoubtedly amazing  he didn't get support from big name sponsors until well into his career.Kirill's approach to riding bikes is very creative  be it on natural terrain or on self built obstacles. In the early 2010s  Kirill was one of the first riders to backflip out of an open loop jump - a jump setup he went back to this july  when he tried to realize a trick he had been envisioning for the last three years: he wanted to do a double backflip out of an open loop. Unfortunately he couldn't land it yet  but let's hope it's still in his future to go for stunts like that one!!Below are a couple of photos and videos that hopefully show you what kind of rider Kirill is - he does things his way  that's for sure! How will we go on from here?First of all we want to thank everyone who supports Kirill through this campaign or in other ways - we are sure Kirill appreciates every help you guys can provide right now. We will update this page regularly and give you current info on his condition. We are also working on further ways to help Kirill on his path to recovery - this will be a work in progress for sure  since we are all scrambling this together in a hurry  trying to help him as quickly as possible!!#GETWELLBENDERONI,7786,10000,34,78,274,247,6

Heather Rosser Miranda,https://www.gofundme.com/68grgsw,0,PLANO,TX,Hello friends of our sweet Heather. As many of you know Heather was diagnosed with a brain tumor last week. Her surgery was a success and the prognosis is good.  I saw her Saturday and yesterday and she had progressed a lot in 48  hours. Joey thinks she will be at Baylor for at least until the weekend then moved to a Rehab Facility for a couple of weeks.  The right side of her body is most affected so she will have to train it to do everything again.  Joey thinks it will probably be about 9 months or so before she's back to herself.  He's going to post her progress for us and I'm hoping she will want to take over at some point.  Joey said people are asking how to help.  I talked to Heather about this yesterday and she smiled as best she could.  Meals and such can be arranged from this site as well.   Our girl's ha a difficult week or so but she's a trooper and no doubt will Rock this Recovery!,4440,50000,8,9,23,225,6

I had gone to see an ENT Doctor about a persistent sinus infection that I had been dealing with for several years. As well as a lump in my neck that I thought was a clogged up gland or something  stemming from the sinus issues I was experiencing. As it turned out the sinus issues and the “swollen gland” were not related at all. The Doctor took one look in my throat and said “that doesn’t look good”. Now  that is not something you want to hear; it is bad enough to hear that from your mechanic or your HVAC guy but when you hear that from a Doctor it will definitely get your attention. The Doctor was confident enough in his diagnoses he uttered these words that I will never forget; “YOU HAVE CANCER AND IT WILL KILL YOU”…So three tests came out of that first visit to the Doctor  the first was a “fine needle aspiration” of the swollen gland to send off to the lab  the Doctor did that right there. The others were two CT scans  one to look at my sinuses and see what is going on and the second one with contrast to look at the gland in my neck.On the second visit to the Doctor I brought with me my rock  my best friend  and my wife  thankfully they are all the same person. The scans showed that my sinuses where very much clogged up  but I already knew that and I was more concerned about this thing growing in my neck. Believe it or not  both the test the Doctor did in his office and the CT scan where “INCONCLUSIVE”… What the scan was able to confirm was that the “gland” was actually lymph nodes! At least three of them…Next came sinus surgery to fix my sinus issue and a biopsy of my tonsil to verify the Doctor’s diagnoses of throat cancer. Both to be done at the same time and to be done just as soon as possible. So much so that the Doctor was willing to work on his birthday and move other things around just so he could get it done sooner. I had asked him to be aggressive and he was doing just that.September 20th  surgery day. Side note here; it was also the first day of my new life as a non-smoker. Something that I needed to do anyway but I knew smoking and trying to heal from sinus and throat surgery would not be a good thing  not to mention the fact that the Doctor believes I have cancer  so yeah not a bad day to call it quits. Surgery went well  the sinus issues ended up being a Streptococcus viral infection resulting from a bad tooth infection a few years earlier and a really bad fungal infection that I most likely had for years even before the viral infection  both in my Maxillary sinus cavity. September 27th  one week follow up with the Doctor  that means a camera being shoved up my nose  ALL THE WAY UP MY NOSE  and then down the back of the throat  needless to say not a pleasant experience. But more irritating then the camera was the fact that the results from the biopsy were not back yet  so we still don’t know for sure what we are dealing with… The Doctor sent me over to have a PET CT scan done  this is similar to the CT scans I had already done but with a few significant differences. The PET scan is a much longer tube and I had to hold my arms over my head and it took twice as long. Not to mention the biggest difference  I had to have a radioactive isotope injected into my blood stream and then wait for an hour for it to cycle throughout my body. The idea is that the sugar based isotope will collect in the areas that have cancer and then light up on the PET scan.Later that same day I got the phone call I was dreading… Results came back for both the biopsy and the PET CT Scan. Confirmed it is CANCER!  Specifically; Squamous Small Cell Carcinoma. But then he threw something else into the mix  it was P16 positive. Ok  so what does that mean? It is actually a good thing  if there can be such a thing when it comes to Cancer  it means that the Cancer is caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and not necessarily because of smoking or drinking. It means that the prognosis is better  the treatment has higher success rates and the chances are good that once treatment is complete it will never come back!This was actually something that my wife spoke into existence. On the day of my surgery when the Doctor came out to tell her how the surgery went she asked him if it was HPV related  his response was “that’s the one you want”. There is great power in our words!I won’t bore you with all of the details  but needless to say the next couple of weeks kind of went by in a blur. Appointments with a Medical Oncologists to talk about chemotherapy treatments and a Radio Oncologists to talk about radiation treatments. Not to mention phone calls with family to let people know what was going on and to get the prayer warriors geared up. Because we know there is great power in our prayers!My treatment plan included 3 doses of chemotherapy and 35 rounds of radiation over 7 weeks. The chemo was not too bad as far as getting the dose  but it has one wallop of a punch the next day and every day after that. The Radiation treatment was bad in different ways  first you are fitted for a mask. The mask is a large framed plastic mesh that is heated in hot water and then stretched over your head  face  neck and shoulders and then snapped onto a table. The idea is to hold you still and lock you in a position on a table so you cannot move. A machine then moves around you and delivers the radiation  for me it was 9 different positions the machine would move around to and then shoot radiation aimed directly at the tumor in my neck. The accumulative effects of the radiation would eventually bring on very dramatic side effects.Before I started treatments all of my Doctors said that I would lose weight during the treatments and my Radio oncologist recommended I get a feeding tube put in as she said the radiation would eventually make it very hard to eat. I initially was dead set against having the feeding tube  I would later regret that decision. I bulked up to 210 lbs.  from my normal 190 – 195. It would not be enough…The treatments started on the same day  chemo in the morning and radiation that afternoon. Took them both like a champ  I started off with a great attitude. I have my wife by my side  prayer warriors praying and most importantly Jesus in my heart  so nothing was going to stop me I was going to fly through this like it was nothing.Day two had different ideas for me… I woke up the day after my first Chemo treatment to the hiccups  not just a simple case of hiccups that will go away with some sugar or slowly drinking water  or even when your little sister asks you what color the elephant is… No these were monster hiccups the kind that hurt and didn’t stop for anything  the kind that went on for hours and hours. Thanks for that chemo! At least the radiation wasn’t bad…Getting over the initial issues with the chemo I settled into a nice little routine of radiation every day. Every business day  every single business day!!! Somewhere around day 5 or so I had a panic attack getting strapped down to the table. And almost was not able to let them put that mask over me  which by now had become very claustrophobic. I had to close my eyes  ask Jesus for help like right now and breathe. I found out later that my wife  who was always just on the other side of the wall while I was getting the radiation  was singing to me every time the light would come on indicating the beam was active. Knowing that I never had another panic attack. You know what  there is also great power in song!By the end of October I had started to lose the hair on my face and up the back of my neck. The day I noticed the hair falling off of my face was the day I shaved it all off and ended my almost 2 decade old look. I took a picture and sent it to my dad and my son  both saying the same thing  I look like my dad. What can I say  he is a good looking guy! The hair on the back of my neck was not as noticeable as the length of the rest of my hair covered it well.November 8th  one of the worst days yet. I had been struggling to keep my weight up for a while at this point  mostly due to the fact that everything either tasted horrible or didn’t have a test at all. Big setbacks  both in my weight and my attitude. So much so we had to call in the Calvary  called my dad to pray with us then called the nurse at the radio oncologist’s office to get the ball rolling to get me some fluids and a surgical consult to have the feeding tube put in. I was down so far that I worried that I may not bounce back quickly enough. I had lost so much weight in my face that the radiation mask was not fitting anymore  that would delay my treatment if it went too far. 182 lbs. from the high of 210  down 28 lbs. in less than a month.I got the feeding tube a few days later  outpatient surgery and a visit to the Doctor’s office the next day for instructions on how to use it. I made use of it as soon as we got home that day  I was so hungry. But even that wasn’t enough and I was still struggling to keep up my weight. Many bad days and then some really bad days. The chemo was making me nauseous  making my ears ring  giving me the hiccups and severe constipation. Thanks again chemo! The radiation however was quickly becoming a competitor in the race to see which one was going to kill me first.On the day of my last Chemotherapy the Doctor came in and the first words he said was  “you must have bone marrow of steal”.  They had been monitoring all of my numbers with weekly labs  I would have to come up to the office and have blood drawn every week  checking my white and red blood counts as well as a whole bunch of other things they want to make sure don’t get out of whack. The chemo Doctor told me in the beginning that a lot of people don’t make it to the third round of chemo  mostly because their white blood count is so low that if they got the chemo it could kill them. The number he wants to see is a count above 1 000. After 2 rounds of chemo and 32 rounds of radiation up to that point my numbers were an amazing 2 380!!! Not only was the chemo and radiation not destroying my immune system my numbers where actually going up! See  there is great  great power in prayer. There is great power in your prayers!March 26th  Almost 7 months to the day from when I first heard the words “you have cancer”  I now have heard the words that allow me to move on to the next phase of this journey  REMISSION!But my journey is far from over  I have many years to come full of tests  very expensive tests and checkups and Doctors visit and medications to try and counteract the effects of the chemo and radiation. The ringing in my ears is permanent and I have lost a significant amount of hearing. I have lost over 50 lbs. Food still has little to no taste  so even when I am not in pain I have very little desire to eat. The radiation has caused a lot of damage to my jaw and gums  the results so far have been that all of my top teeth and most of my bottom have been removed and I now have to have full dentures on top and a partial on bottom. This has also necessitated the need for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy where I am placed in a sealed tank with 100% oxygen and pressurized to 2 and ½ atmospheres (or about 85 feet below sea level) for almost 2 hours a day. I will do that for 30 treatments  if my ears hold up  I had to have tubes put in my ears to help equalize the pressure.But with my rock by my side  Jesus in my heart and prayer warriors like you I know I can overcome any obstacles life throws my way.  So thank you everyone! Thank you for giving a few minutes to tell my story. Thank you for your prayers! Thank you for your financial and emotional support. Thank you for your words of encouragement  not just for me but also for my wife and my family. Thank you for the love you have shown us. And please continue to keep us in your prayers.And please always remember that there is GREAT POWER IN PRAYER! Please donate and forward as God directs you.Thank you and may God bless you all.God’s humble servant John Ginger,1295,25000,9,5,23,203,6

Support for Diana&apos;s Kidney Dialysis,https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-diana039s-kidney-dialysis,4,BOSTON,MA,Diana is a second grade student at the Donald McKay K-8 School and a beloved member of our school community who was recently diagnosed with acute kidney failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. ANCA vasculitis is a rare type of autoimmune disease that causes swelling of the blood vessels and can affect different organs in the body. In Diana’s case  the vasculitis has attacked her kidneys resulting in acute kidney failure. Treatment involves an array of medications with unwanted side effects and eventually a kidney transplant. While Diana waits to become eligible for a transplant  she receives dialysis three times a week to help clean the blood and maintain fluid balance  which can be exhausting and is extremely expensive. Even during dialysis  Diana is still a hardworking and dedicated student. She is at school for half of the day and is eager and excited to learn. She has a tutor at the hospital where she receives dialysis and she always stays on top of her school work. She enjoys doing math activities with her friends at school and her teacher describes her as a sweet student and a gentle soul. Outside of school  Diana loves to read  draw  and sing. During this difficult time  Diana’s grandmother has also been battling cancer and has been in and out of the hospital several times. This family has endured many difficult obstacles emotionally and financially over the past several months and we hope you will help us support Diana and her family.-McKay School Community,2250,5000,26,45,42,76,6

Tony&#x2019;s Traumatic Brain Injury,https://www.gofundme.com/s978e-hope-for-tony,0,NEWYORK,NY,"I’m Armani  fiancé to Tony who suffered a horrific accident in our home from falling down the stairs. On Apr 5  2018 what seemed like a normal day of us getting ready to head to my grandmothers hospital turned into one of the worst days of our lives. Tony actually died at the hospital  was revived and remained comatose for almost 3 weeks. In that time  he developed a swollen brain  collapsed lung  pneumonia  and more complications that he still has and lives with everyday.  Not only has this been one of the most difficult times in my life  but being faced with losing my best friend made it all the more painful. Tony was there for me everyday while dealing with my grandmothers sickness which subsequently left her in a coma as well two months earlier in February. At 93 my grandmother had overcome a small bowel obstruction surgery which led to catching pneumonia right after surgery and being critically sick in ICU for weeks in a coma  with little chance of survival as well. The only other source of support has been from my dad and he has been there to make sure I am taking care of myself  as well as checking on Tony every week also. Unfortunately my mother passed away when I was 5 months old but I know I would have had her support as well. Our road  and I say \our\"" because its always been Tony and I  has been so very rough since but everyday I have hope.Although we were to get married this summer and missed that opportunity  I still want to marry him. I would do anything for him and if I had the resources I would get the best of everything to ensure his success.  UPDATE 1/8/19: Tony's trach has been removed and he is doing much better and has no more infection in his throat. Although we had an emergency chest tube procedure to remove fluid from his lungs due to aspiration pneumonia  since then he has recovered.The fund would basically cover all Medical  & financial bills that continue to pile up. I would love to take him to a new home in NYC equip with everything he needs  which I believe would make it easier for me to maintain his needs  and my grandmothers together as well. I have been trying to manage and maintain. I’d like to put down on a place in NY a condo for all of us  but if not then to help with buying a van  and all extra modifications not covered by insurance also. If I had one wish it would be to rewind that day but I can't and that's something that plagues me every SINGLE day. I feel responsible because I asked him to go upstairs and get the laundry bag  and if I would have just done it myself this never would have happened. Watching a loved one in any pain is heart wrenching but I know there is hope because we have each other  and we believe we can get through this as hard as it is.Eventually once things are somewhat managed and he is home  I want to become a nurse and be able to better care for Tony  my grandmother  and others.I will never give up on him  on us and on our love. Thank you for taking the time to read our story and know that any and everything helps.I don't know you and you may not know me but I appreciate it all. The kind words  and sentiments we receive everyday from people we don't know makes a world of difference.I believe this is what makes humanity. So again thank you and I wish you peace and love through out your own journey. Armani & Tony￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼""",4907,175000,14,3,74,391,6

Medical Fund For Kelli,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-fund-for-kelli,9,NEWYORK,NY,Yesterday was my friend Kelli's 56th birthday and she shared the most heart wrenching story. One that was so difficult and embarrassing for her to tell because she is not a person who likes to ask for help. So I am asking for her.In April of 2017 she had a small heart attack followed soon thereafter by a massive LAD (left anterior descending) heart attack. Doctors call it a 'widow maker' and only 5% survive it.  It left her with severely compromised health including severe sleep apnea. Her daily medication intake now comes at a huge monthly cost. Her doctor told her she can no longer work and has  therefore lost her health insurance.Sadly  her husband's response to this was to get up early one morning and leave her a note that said  “I did not plan on taking care of someone in my golden years so I am leaving you. Do not try to contact me. Goodbye”.The stress of that caused another heart attack and she's lost everything.Fortunately her lovely daughter and son-in-law were good enough to take her in but there's a limit to their ability to help financially.Kelli is scraping together the monthly medication cost but cannot afford a very much needed bi-pap machine for the sleep apnea. She's tried every agency and benevolent association but none have been able to help. The cost is $2 000.Please help me raise the money to provide the recuperative support this sweet  kind-hearted woman needs to be able to function  survive and be there for her young grandson. Thank you!,2075,2000,24,104,57,123,6

Assist Kelli Rouse in recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/money-to-assist-kelli-in-recovery,7,JOHNSONCITY,TN,Kelli was a victim of a very viscous dog attack the beginning of September. She faught off the dog for almost 30 minutes while her daughter  Selena watched. She made sure the dog was only attacking her while trying to get him outside  saving her daughter's life. In the mean time  she received severe injuries to all her limbs. In-route to the hospital via helicopter  her heart stopped. They were thankfully able to revive her a few minutes later. Upon evaluation  it was uncertain if she would keep her limbs. She ended up losing her right arm above the elbow  her tricep in her left arm is mostly gone leaving very limited mobility  and her right calf has 2 large chunks taken out of the muscle leaving her unable to walk without assistance. She will need at least a year of physical therapy on her arm and leg to get to where she can gain some normal mobility back and a lifetime recovering from the trauma mentally. Her insurance is almost tapped out as far as keeping her in rehab. Her church has put a wheelchair ramp on her house. She deserves the top of the line prosthetic and other equipment.  She is only 35 with a 2 year old daughter to care for. Any little bit you can assist with will be greatly appreciated. Let's get her the best care available and top of the line equipment there is out there.

Help and Healing,https://www.gofundme.com/vpu7p-help-and-healing,8,SALTLAKECITY,UT,I have a good friend at  work and both he and his wife have had significant and frustrating health challenges this past year.They're not the type to ask for help and they just go forward with a plan to do their best to work through the mountain of expenses that have piled up due to the seemingly never ending tests  procedures and doctors visits. They've not found many helpful answers and they continue to live with pain. And just when they seem to be settling in and accepting a new normal  they get blindsided by something more.I'll respect their privacy and leave it to them share any of the medical details  but I wanted to set this up as a way to help in some small way to let them know that we care and that we're here to help how we can.Please consider donating whatever amount you can  large or small  to help Adam and Kira Clark with some of their recent and ongoing medical expenses. Thank you!,1290,5000,46,26,19,4,6
Beating Breast Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/kpyn5p-beating-breast-cancer,1,PORTSAINTLUCIE,FL,This is for Marty  one of the most selfless souls I have ever met. She would never start this herself because she always thinks there are others who need help more desperately than she does. She has stage 4 breast cancer. The cancer had spread through breasts  lymph nodes  next to her heart and esophagus.She was put on a chemo treatment so aggressive that she couldn’t continue to work. It’s been almost a year and she has budgeted well  but has gone through her savings. Through chemo  without a job  she still shared her savings and paid for loved ones rent  food  and other expenses that they couldn’t afford to pay for themselves. She has been the main care giver for her own mother  still changing bed linens  preparing meals  and taking care of her home  all while extremely ill. She hasn’t stopped giving.She has been that way her whole life. Taking in children without parents  or in a bad situation  feeding them  clothing them  caring for them like her own. Not just children either  grown adults  foreigners who had no where to live  just about anyone who needed any sort of help. She lives for others. Chemo ended and she underwent surgery  a double mastectomy and lymph node removal.  She now has to go through radiation. 6 weeks  5 days a week. She no longer has insurance since she has been out of work for so long and has to pay out of pocket for treatment  a place to stay close to the hospital  as well as food. She is an amazing mother  grandmother  and friend. There are many who need her in their lives and futures.Please help her get well and beat cancer! Thank you so much for your time and any and all efforts made to help!Very Respectfully someone who loves Marty and can’t imagine a life without her,1145,4000,8,29,20,225,6
Saving Voice,https://www.gofundme.com/saving-voice,8,FABIUS,NY,Don Walsh  a member of the Fabius-Pompey community  town of Pompey Volunteer fireman  husband and father is fighting a tough battle against Esophageal Cancer. As you can imagine the costs can be outrageous. We are asking for help to raise enough for Don to get another opinion (not covered by insurance) to determine the course he will need to take in order to make the best decision for his future.  As of now Don is scheduled for a Dec. 6 surgery that will take away his voice forever. We have established an immediate goal but we would hope to exceed any expectations to help Don  who is currently unable to work  and his family to remain in their home. His daughter Sarah  a 2014 Fabius-Pompey graduate and 2018 SU grad  has deferred her plans to continue her education at the Indiana University School of Optometry to be there for her dad. We hope with the help of a caring community we can go above and beyond our goal and be there for Don and his family. Thank you all and Please Share!,9250,9500,18,97,129,460,6
Bob Boyles Radiation Relief,https://www.gofundme.com/bob-boyles-radiation-relief,0,CAMDENWYOMING,DE,Our friend  Sharon Boyles  the Business Manager at Calvary Christian Academy who is a cancer survivor  is currently fighting for her husband Bob Boyles.  Bob has been fighting cancer for the last several months and the prognosis is looking very good! Over the last two months of chemo treatment  the tumor has shrunk so much that he no longer needs to have surgery! However  this is where things get very challenging for Bob and his wife Sharon.  Bob now has to travel every single day to UPenn Medical in Philadelphia for radiation treatments. The course of treatment he needs and the technology is not available at a local hospital. Since Bob has been out of work for several months  he is not able to make his normal salary. Long term disability income kicks in shortly  which is less than his short term disability payments. Driving to Philly every day for 6 weeks and then having to take off another 6 weeks for recovery is going to devastate them financially. Here is where you can help. Would you please consider donating to this fund to help offset the cost of the gas  tolls  loss of income  and bills that are already piling up? Bob will be out of work for another 3 months at least and they are relying on Sharon's income to make ends meet. Also  since Bob will have to travel to UPenn daily  if you have a day of the week that you are free  would you consider being his taxi for the day? The trips to Philly have already taken a toll on their vehicles and finances and it would be great if some volunteers could offer to take him to his appointments. He only has to be there for 30 minutes each day and then return home. If you are able to volunteer your time  vehicle  and gas  please email us using the contact feature. Bob easily generates great conversation and is a lot of fun to hang out with  I am sure it would be a blessing to them and to you!Would you please pray for Bob and Sharon  that God would grant them the strength to go through this trial and provide for them in miraculous ways?  Would you ask God what He wants you to give to this fund in order to allow God's blessings to flow through you? Thank you for taking the time to read about Bob's needs. Would you please share this campaign with as many people as possible? Thank you and may God bless your faithfulness!,3005,10000,14,30,16,86,6

My name is Yami LaGuardia. I am the sister of Rita Destinee Noda. On the evening of October 9  2018 a fire engulfed my sister's home that she shared with my niece Kiani  our uncle Otto who is special needs as well as her adopted daughter  Jacqueline whom has Down syndrome and a cardiac condition. Thankfully  they are alive and for that we are so very  grateful. Fortunately  they were able to save all but one of their pets which are mostly rescues. They aren’t able to salvage anything in their home. They have lost all of their furniture  clothing  food  all electronics necessary for work and school as well as  Jaqueline’s walker which helps her to get around  her wheelchair  hospital bed  her shower chair  toiletries  day to day necessities  kitchen appliances   cookware  and more. The funds collected will be used to help them to obtain housing and necessities. They will be needing to rebuild. This will be a long and excruciating journey but I feel that with your help  we can help her recover from this life-changing tragedy. At this moment  we humbly ask that you find it in your hearts to help her family. My sister  as we can all attest is the type of individual that has helped so many people at one point in her life or another. She goes the extra mile and goes out of her way whenever anyone needs her. I ask that you kindly please help us to help her in this time of desperation and hopelessness that she is feeling as a result of this tragic accident. As per GoFundMe  she will be the sole beneficiary of this fundraiser and all funds will be wired directly into her bank account.Thank you and God bless.,4063,20000,9,20,118,1000,6
Help Marci heal,https://www.gofundme.com/help-marci-heal,9,GARWIN,IA,Hi  my name is Marci.  I am 62 and a self employed massage therapist. On August 27th I had a heart attack.  On September 4th I had triple bypass surgery.  The heavy duty medical bills are taken care of.  But there is nothing for short term disability and the every day living expenses are still there.   What little cushion I had is gone.  And I don’t know for sure when I will be able to return to work.  It seems there is a difference between “ you can’t work for two months” and “you’ll be able to work in two months”.  They said the first and I heard the second and it probably isn’t so.  When I do return to work it will have to be gradual.  Meanwhile utilities still need to be paid  rent needs to be kept up on my studio  the lawn needs to be mowed and this winter the snow will have to be removed.  I had to set a goal amount  so I set one that I’m sure will keep me going for several months giving me the time I need to heal completely and return to work safely.Anything will help.  Thank you for your kind attention and in advance for your donation.Marci,1555,5000,12,31,12,78,6
No One Fights Alone- #Sheristrong,https://www.gofundme.com/no-one-fights-alone-sheristrong,0,VARNVILLE,SC,Sheri was diagnosed with Stage 1 B  lung cancer on October 4  2018. She had to leave her house and her job  after she worked so hard to get a promotion as an assistant manager  and move in with her daughter 2 hours away from home. She basically left the independent life that she knew  the life she worked so hard at  to move in with her daughter and her family  for them to help take care of her  as the doctors told her she has a long road ahead of her. She has no medical insurance  as she hasn't been with her job long enough to have obtained insurance. Her daughter is working with the financial depts in the hospital to try to get any sort of financial assistance for her that they can. Sheri has 3 daughters and 9 grandchildren that she loves dearly! She has already undergone many tests  with still more to come. A test today will determine if they can go straight to surgery and remove the tumor from her lungs. If that test doesn't go well  then she will most likely go straight into chemotherapy.  Any donations will be greatly appreciated. With her being out of work  she feels like shes a financial burden to her family  and we don't want her to feel that way. We just want her to focus on her health and staying strong. If you cannot donate  we just ask that you keep Sheri and her family in your prayers.

Andres Has Lymphoma Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/andres-has-lymphoma-cancer,3,ERIE,CO,Last week  little Andres David Suarez who is only 18 months old was diagnosed with a type of Lymphatic Cancer. It is called Neuroblastoma Sarcoma. He had been having trouble breathing and it was initially thought of as being asthma. After months of treatment for asthma  with no improvement  it was decided to check further. After X-Rays and CAT scans  they found a cancerous mass that was impeding on his trachea. This is what was causing the breathing problems. The mass is dislocating his trachea by pushing it sideways. Andres and his parents live in Bogota  Colombia. His mother is my cousin and I feel the need to try and help in any way that I can. The hospital conditions in Colombia are not what we are used to in the USA  but these doctors are trying their best to save his life. Although healthcare in Colombia is far cheaper than we experience here in the states  there is no way that his parents can handle this alone. His father is in the Air Force and his mother is a home maker with another child as well.He will begin chemotherapy this week and he will be kept in the NICU for the time being to see how he reacts to the chemo. The hope in the chemo treatments is to reduce the size of the tumor before an operation to remove it. There is a huge risk to the surgery due to its location near the carotid artery  so it is important to reduce the size of the tumor.The expenses are already building up and the need for funds is immediate. This little guy needs all of our help that we can give.Español:La semana pasada  el pequeño Andres David Suarez que es solo 18 meses de edad fue diagnosticado con un tipo de Cancer Linfático  el cual es llamado Neuroblastoma Sarcoma. Andres ha estado teniendo dificultad en su respiración la cual inicialmente los medicos pensaron que era asthma. Después de meses de tratamiento por asthma  con no buenos resultados  los medicos decidieron hacer análisis mas profundos com X-Rays y CAT scans  donde encontraron una masa cancerina en la traquea la cual esta impidiendo a Andres respirar apropiadamente  esta masa esta desviando su traquea empujando hacia los lados.Andres y sus padres viven en Bogota  Colombia. Su madre es mi prima y Yo siento la necesidad de tratar de ayudar en algún modo posible. Los hospitales en Colombia no están en las mismas condiciones a de los hospitales en los Estados Unidos  pero hay muy buenos doctores capaces de tratar la condición de Andres para salvar su vida. El padre de Andres David pertenece a las Fuerzas Aéreas Colombiana y su mamá es ama de casa junto con la hermanita de Andres.  No hay forma en que los padres de Andres David puedan sobre pasar esta situación solos  ellos necesitan de nuestra ayuda y un pequeño aporte sea económico y espiritual puede hacer mucha diferencia.El va empezar quimioterapia esta semana y por el momento va estar admitido a la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos  por el tiempo que sea necesario y ver los resultados de la quimioterapia. La esperanza de empezar  el tratamiento de la quimioterapia es reducir el tamaño de la masa antes de programar cirugía para removerlo. Hay un gran riesgo en esta cirugía ya que la masa esta localizada cerca a la Arteria Carótida  por eso es importante reducir el tamaño del tumor.,1125,20000,4,6,31,703,6

This has her lung usage at only 22%. The doctors have also told her that she will have to be on Oxygen now the rest of her life. On top of all this they told her she cant work. I dont know how someone is supposed to be able to afford to live being told they cant work and pay all of these medical bills and antibiotics being prescribed just to be able to breathe. Disability takes up to a year and half to kick in. Until that does  Sherrie would need all of our help  even if its only $1. She knows that not everyone has much to give but even $1 will help go towards paying all these antibiotics she has to be on until hopefully disability goes thru which I know is in Gods hands and he will take great care of that and her.

Hudson Grey&apos;s Journey with AFM,https://www.gofundme.com/hudson-grey039s-journey,0,TROUTDALE,OR,"AFM won't stop Hudson!! It may slow him down a smidge but no stopping anytime soon. 04/22/19We are now at 2 years and 6 months with Acute Flaccid Myelitis. No end or cure in sight. Surgery for his scoliosis in the future is at approximately 90%. Appointment after appointment for all his needs is exhausting him. He just wants to be a kid. He has his moments when he gets down about having AFM but he picks himself right back up. His anxiety and fear of dying has improved over the last month. He is so afraid that his dad and/or I will die. It's not just a fear  it's a soul crushing fear for him. We are trying to get in to have him see a psychiatrist to help him deal with it. We are so blessed that he has a great love for the Lord. He talks to God all the time and prays every night. Just so you all know  he prays for literally everyone. So you're all covered. Lol. This kids heart is bigger than his fears and worries. Keep us in your prayers and please help if you can. Share this as much as you want. We appreciate anything and everything that is given to us. Prayers  love and good juju included. XoOctober 3  2018 was Hudson's 2 year anniversary of getting sick and being diagnosed with AFM.  https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/about-afm.htmlSince 2016  our lives have been riding on the roller coaster of Life. Many ups and downs  more ups than downs though because Hudson is one heck of a trooper and a Superhero to everyone he meets. https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkatu.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmysterious-outbreak-in-minnesota-previously-sickened-oregon-kids&h=AT2CjsOovofZsSsqppE0Csty9e6tyWoSM5lleziwWC-THqgYhTmTw4ffKVhpvDJ4GZTN0EOwVkT9rFepwq-nCZFL-hWi09C-GeuA3c7H4tWXbiheQT0dM4FMai76RDP357i5jRVG3n05V7LoWgThis past 6 months or so  Hudson has been experiencing what he calls \spidy senses\"" in his chest where his heart is. This was very alarming and concerning to us. We've been to his Doctor and now have an appointment with a Cardiologist. This last week he had an EKG done. Nothing that alarmed the Cardiologist so we can wait until our appointment that is coming up soon.Hud still has paralysis in his right arm  shoulder and partial neck. He's able to move his right hand a little bit and that is amazing. We call his right arm \""Righty\"" he loves it. His scoliosis doesn't require surgery  thank the LORD! We are looking into nerve transfer so he can have more function with his left arm. He is not able to lift up his arm to wave or high five anyone. He does have function from the elbow down and uses his left hand to write and do other things. He can shrug his should as well. He has control of his neck for the most part. He isn't able to lean forwards or backwards completely. Side to side is still tricky. If he falls  he sin't able to catch himself  its very scary and sad to see him go through all of this. So him not being able to lean in those directions makes it impossible for him to wipe himself when he goes #2. His body is not as strong as he would like but he keeps a pretty good attitude about it. He was doing OT/PT once a week for a year and a half up until June. We took the summer off so he could have a break being that he had met and exceeded all his goals. We are now only doing OT once a month and PT every 6 months. I don't like that. I do as much as I can at home but I am defiantly not as awesome as OT and PT. We are going to look into creating a space in our garage for Hudson to have a place to do his therapy that he needs. Getting equipment is what we are looking into.We have done fundraising before and are so thankful for our friends and family who have helped us along the way with all of this. Lately we have been trying to do all this on our own without fundraising. It's hard when I'm not able to work a regular 9-5. I decided to drive with Uber and that helps when I am able to do so. Recently I haven't been able to. Hudson has come home from school a few times not feeling well. He's missed school because his chest hurts. Some days he is just extremely exhausted and just wants to snuggle. I don't take these days for granted anymore. Frank has a great job with the State but not having that second income is definitely taking its toll.  We make it work but it's getting harder. Our goal is to try to eliminate any amount of stress as possible  no matter how big or small. Hudson and his older brothers are what's important.  We appreciate anything that is donated. We can't thank you all enough for being on this Journey with Us.His birthday is October 15  he will be 8. I will try to post more about his journey from the beginning until now.

Robert&apos;s Medical Care,https://www.gofundme.com/robert039s-medical-care,6,MARTINEZ,CA,Robert Russell was visiting the Philippines with his wife when he suffered a serious brain injury that was exacerbated by previous conditions. His situation critical  he underwent emergency brain surgery and spent about 2 weeks in ICU. He is slowly recovering and going through physical therapy. His medical costs have thus far been covered by family but they continue to grow. Due to the insurance and health care system there  payments for medical care are pay as you go. We are anticipating at least a 6 month recovery before he will be ambulatory enough to return home.   Robert is an Army Veteran and we have applied to the VA to help cover his costs  however  we have been told to expect at least 3 to 4 months before recompense. We are hoping that we can get it expedited for him. We are asking for any help in covering his medical bills until the VA can step in.,295,10000,8,3,8,79,6

Doug Morrison,https://www.gofundme.com/68hu18o,8,FRANKFORT,IL,Last week  Doug was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We are going to beat this thing! Many of you have asked how you can help  and we would love your positive thoughts  prayers  and support along the way. Please do not hesitate to reach out to Doug to ask how he is doing  or share something awesome or funny to help keep his spirits up. For those who are able and want to  we will likely face some financial needs as well  and would be very grateful for any help you can provide in that manner too. In the short term  this diagnosis will mean lots of small changes around the house... we'll need to hire someone to cut the grass and do some other maintenance at the house that Doug usually takes care of. We will probably also hire someone to do some cleaning for me  so that it'll free up my time to focus on what's most important. More than this  we've been told by many people that insurance often doesn't cover treatments recommended by doctors. Some estimates I've seen say that these costs can easily be in the TENS of THOUSANDS of dollars. (Crazy  isn't it?!) We will know more in the weeks to come  and check back to the caringbridge site for more details. We appreciate all your love and support for Doug!,11775,15000,31,79,88,111,6

He has been in and out of the hospital since September. And now that he has fluid in his lung and heart sacks  he has been moved to a hospital in Birmingham. Birmingham is about an hour away from Saks Alabama. And we all know I still don't drive so getting there and getting to work is a bit of a hassle. With me missing so much work and Chad being so far away we decided that I should take a leave from work. However that will put us with no finances. This will definitely help us pay the bills  get me transportation to and from the hospital  so I don't have to worry about any of this and just focus on Chad.I will keep you updated on his condition at the hospital and hopefully he will recover sooner rather than later. Thank you in advance for helping us out. As you all know this is really humbling for me as I really don't like to ask for help. Thank you again we are extremely grateful.,1010,4100,8,25,11,120,6

Help KitKat Kick Cancer&apos;s Butt,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpKathrynWallFightALL,7,NEWBRITAIN,CT,Our daughter  Kathryn  was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia two days before Thanksgiving 2017.  She spent 31 nights inpatient in a row from diagnosis until the end of the first round of her chemotherapy treatment  coming home two days before Christmas. She spent the next 7 month working through many more rounds of chemotherapy as an outpatient with CCMC's hematology/oncology clinic  missing out on months of school due to the severe flu epidemic last winter and her treatment suppressing her immune system  allergic reactions to chemo  pain episodes  due to unknown infection which put her inpatient for a week in January.The last day of July  she was able to begin the last but longest phase of her therapy  called long term maintenance.  She will finish this phase and her treatment in March of 2020.  We recently have been dealing with a few ER visits for fever  which is her protocol since her suppressed immune system compromises her ability to fight off simple infections. We also have been working closely with the endocrine team because the steroid pulses which are part of her monthly chemotherapy  cause blood sugar spikes while on the steroids and lows off the steroids.  She has been diagnosed with Steroid Induced Diabetes and Adrenal Insufficiency.So as grateful as we are for how she has been doing getting through teatment  we still have a long bumpy road ahead  and lots of hospital visits  planned and unplanned ahead.  Donations towards our unending medical bills that insurance doesnt cover( Er and clinic and inpatient copays  prescription copays  parking fees at CCMC  etc) are always appreciated.We are so thankful for all of you who have already donated to our previous YouCaring page and personally to us  and have supported us throughout this process and continue to do so.  That page was taken down when GoFundMe bought YouCaring  so we have created this page for those that want to continue to support us.,7085,7000,44,101,7,3,6

Help Sam Wrestle Again,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpSamWrestleAgain,6,AUSTIN,TX,Hi! I'm Sam  a Party World Rassler who broke their arm attempting a difficult (and very cool) move! After rushing to the hospital and having my arm temporarily set I followed up with an orthopedic surgeon who recommended quick surgery in order to ensure that I regain as much mobility and range of motion in my wrist as possible. Unfortunately  the way the bone broke meant that without surgery I'd likely experience pain and limited mobility in my wrist  and especially my thumb. As an artist and wrestler  but also just as someone who enjoys the full  pain-free use of their wrists and thumbs on the regular  this actually frightened me more than surgery. I'm recovering post-surgery now  and next week will start physical therapy!Unfortunately  surgery and physical therapy are expensive. My insurance has a high deductible  leaving me with some significant out-of-pocket costs. With the help of my training partner  we were able to cover the initial $2110 for the trip to the emergency surgery center  but that doesn’t cover the cost of the follow up surgery  anesthesiologist  or the six weeks of physical therapy I need to get back in the ring by December 1st. The estimate for my surgeon is $1550  my 6 week physical therapy treatment estimate is $1000  and I’m anticipating at least $200 more for the anesthesiologist.Absolutely anything you can contribute is deeply appreciated. If you can't help financially and can only share this fundraiser  I am extremely grateful for your support.Not once have I felt alone or defeated on this journey  because my friends  my amazing partners  and my queer family have been here for me every step of the way. I cannot express how lucky I am  or how I excited I am to recover and continue wrestling with PWR! I know I have a bright and fun future in wrestling  and that with your help   this will only be a minor set-back.,2735,2700,22,101,48,121,6

Baby Micah,https://www.gofundme.com/npzvty-baby-micah,6,NAPOLEON,OH,Those that have met “Baby Micah” would know that he is such a smiley  playful  strong-willed five month old who has many hurdles ahead of him. Within his short life  he’s already had 3 MRI’s  an EEG  sleep study  a few x-rays  ultrasounds  numerous pokes  prods and appointments since birth and his journey has just begun. Driving to and from Nationwide Children’s Hospital for appointments  the Plata family has been seeing the best team of doctors who are in network with Micah’s insurance and who have been successful at performing surgeries for patients with the same condition as Micah. The first and main surgery being the reconstruction of his skull on January 14th  2019. He will be eight months old. As some of you may know  Micah has a rare genetic disorder called Apert Syndrome  which affects only 1 in 160 000 individuals. Micah was born with his skull's sutures prematurely fused  his brain cannot continue to grow and expand without repeated surgeries to reconstruct his skull. Another major symptom of Apert Syndrome are his fingers and toes being fused together (syndactyly)  which requires two separate surgeries around one year old. Other symptoms vary among individuals  and can impact virtually any critical areas such as breathing  eating  hearing  heart  kidney  skeletal  neurological  and neuromuscular functions. So far Micah’s heart and kidneys are in great shape and we are hoping they continue to stay strong. Micah and other children born with Apert Syndrome will typically endure dozens of surgeries during their first few years of life. The Plata’s just moved into a bigger home  then shortly after the twins were born  Ashley had to quit her job to become a stay at home mom. They do not like to ask for handouts  but they really could use the help right now so they can focus on Baby Micah. There will be many round trips to Columbus  missing work  hospital and hotel stays  food and any extra medical expenses that they will need help with. They would appreciate any amount of help you can give  either by making a small monetary donation  saying a prayer for Micah and the whole family as well as the doctors  or simply sending them your love another way. This just makes it a little easier for the difficult road ahead. Thank you.,3659,10000,10,37,56,424,6

Savannah&apos;s fight with cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/savannah039s-fight,7,NEWYORK,NY,Hi  I’m Savannah and I’m 22 years old. In June of this year I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma stage 2. I have 3 tumors. One in my neck  one behind my oesophagus and one in my chest which is the size of a grapefruit! It came completely out of nowhere with only a painless lump forming on my neck  indicating an abnormality. Months prior to being diagnosed I had excruciating itching on my chest. I went to see various doctors and dermatologists who were unable to explain the itching  as the rash wasn’t impactful enough to be considered urgent. Instead  I was told to just use itch relief creams. It was later explained to me that this itching was a side effect of the lymphoma.I’ve been undergoing intensive chemo treatments and been in and out the hospital non-stop. As I come towards the end of my cycles of chemo  I have understood and appreciated life in a much deeper way than the person I was at the beginning of this journey. There is truly nothing more important than staying positive in a time of despair. Through my blog  I hope to inspire others going through this with positivity and hope. It is within the mind that our thoughts are manifested and through thinking more hopeful thoughts we can change our body chemistry. Follow my survival journey on Instagram at the handle @Savssurvivaldiary  https://www.instagram.com/savssurvivaldiary/?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1doh6gftl6l64My brother and some of his friends are taking on the Spartan Race to raise money for my cause. We aim to raise both awareness and funds for those going through this diagnosis. This will include funding local hospitals to train staff to be able to work with a ‘Picc line’ which will ensure an easier and faster process with patients. I also want to donate to others not as lucky as me  who don't have the support I do.All funds will go directly to helping the cause and others like me. Any amount small or large is hugely appreciated! The Spartan Race is a 12mile course through the mountains with over 25 obstacles along the way! It takes place October 27th.Thank you for your support! Savannah,5965,8000,26,75,63,122,6

Liam&apos;s fight against (AML) leukemia,https://www.gofundme.com/liamsamlfight,0,VALDOSTA,GA,I don’t know how to share this with social media and not sure how many details we will share going forward on social media. I think deep down owning and seeing this in black and white will make it even more real and the yearly Facebook memory of this post will haunt me for a long time. However  we are overwhelmed by the support and love we have already received from family  extended family and close friends who we’ve shared this news with and we want to keep the prayers and good vibes rolling so here goes nothing...What started out as any other week with a seemingly innocent but annoying head cold then viral rash turned into Liam being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We are at children’s hospital of Atlanta (CHOA) receiving amazing care from a talented team of doctors and nurses. The course of treatment is 6-9 months. We will have 10 intense days of chemo  then wait patiently for his [blood] counts to drop to nil then recover. All the while holding our breath he doesn’t catch an infection [also it’s flu season] while he’s most vulnerable. This total process takes about 30 days. Then we will discharge from the hospital for about 7-10 days to “reset.” We will have 4 courses of chemo but the 6-9 months come from the chemo then waiting for counts to drop and recover. We still don’t have words to describe how we feel. I’ve always lived my life thinking I’m in control with a strict plan. We had the next two years planned out  or so we thought. But  In this turn of life i am thankful....not peaceful [but i am working towards that].... [thankful that] Liam is so strong and rocking this first course of treatment. We are surrounded by amazing  supportive family that allow billy and I to go out and eat lunch or catch a mid-day snooze when we’ve been up with Liam all night long. And most importantly  that Billy is able to be here with me in Atlanta. We are able to be united in this fight for Liam. I hope after reading this post you’ll join me in slowing down  not planning every move  and being thankful for each moment no matter how mundane. I’ve thanked Billy more in the last 10 days than I have in the last year. The hard times make the better times a little sweeter. We can never know the battle someone else is fighting and it’s not for us to know their battle. Be kind. Be graceful. Since we are four hours from CHOA and our hometown hospital is NOT a children’s hospital we are discussing moving to Atlanta for the course of Liam’s treatment. If Liam should spike a fever he would need IV antibiotics within the hour. For medical updates you can follow our caring bridge.Also  Liam is obsessed with animal videos and loves watching them while we have a procedure or just to pass the time. These hospitals dazeeee are long y’all. Please text me any silly videos of your dog or cat. We may decide to share updates on a social media page or blog but for now it’s too real and too raw to share our sweet boy’s fight. But you can call  text  PM  or FaceTime us anytime for updates. We will gladly share details in those outlets.,5075,10000,20,51,50,142,6

&#x2764;&#xFE0F;Heart Help for Dylan&#x2764;&#xFE0F;,https://www.gofundme.com/heart-help-for-dylan,9,Carbonear,NL,￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼My nephew  Dylan O’Leary ❤️  was born with a congenital heart disease. Up until his 19th birthday  he lived a pretty normal lifestyle. He was very athletic  and extremely active in the world of hockey. During his grade 12 school year  he was drafted to play with a Junior A team  the Woodstock Slammers in Woodstock  New Brunswick. Little did he know that being given such an amazing opportunity would be amazing in more ways than one. Unbeknownst to him and our family  this would be the year his congenital heart disease was discovered. Because of a fluke collar bone break during a Woodstock Slammers’ game in Prince Edward Island  he was brought to hospital and it was only then that his condition  was discovered. The attending doctor was amazed that Dylan had played such a competitive level of hockey  and had never known of his heart condition. He was immediately taken off the ice and doctor’s orders were he would never be allowed to return to play competively again.  There are two issues with Dylan’s❤️ heart. He has what’s called Coarctation of the Aortic Valve. In the spring of 2015  he was flown to Halifax to have a stent inserted to open up his aorta to allow blood to flow more easily to his heart.  Over the past four years  there have been numerous trips for Dylan ❤️ and his family back-and-forth to Toronto to monitor his heart disease developments . The second issue with Dylan’s ❤️heart is what’s called a Bicuspid Aortic Value. The cardiologist in St. John’s preferred that Dylan ❤️ see a cardiologist in Toronto because he was young. They recommend he have a procedure done called “The Ross Procedure”. This procedure will be done on November 27  2018. Dylan❤️  along with his family  will travel to Toronto. He will have to stay in Toronto for a minimum of two weeks.  He will not be able to work for three months post surgery. To alleviate some of the financial burden that will be required to cover the cost of travel  accomadations and post surgery healing  I have created this Go Fund Me page.  When I first mentioned this idea to my sister  who was stressing over the health of her son and worrying about how things were going to work out financially  she told me she didn’t want me to do such a thing. Well sister  I went against your wishes. I hope you can forgive me.  One final thing  thank you to anyone out there who is in a position to help my nephew and our family.  Your thoughtfulness and kindness is truly appreciated.  Much love from our hearts to yours. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,3500,3000,16,117,80,333,6

Surviving the disability nightmare,https://www.gofundme.com/surviving-the-disability-nightmare,5,CAMDEN,AR,We are urgently seeking help for our oldest son  John Heath Malone. In July of 2017  he was riding on his motorcycle on his way to work when a teenage girl who was texting while driving crashed into Heath. He was wearing his helmet and survived but was hurt very seriously. He is left-handed and his left arm was mangled so badly that it had to be amputated at the shoulder. His left knee and hip may have to be replaced and he is in constant pain. The girl’s insurance company is fighting his claim in court and the disability court has turned him down twice. He has no income at all and he is trying to raise ten year old twin boys as a single parent. Your donations are needed and truly appreciated to help him survive until hopefully the first of next year when he again goes to see the disability judge.

Help me raise a new service dog!,https://www.gofundme.com/wxhzj-in-need-of-a-new-service-dog,7,SOUTHBEND,IN,Rewritten as of 12/15/18: After being forced to retire my support dog due to aggressive and temperamental behavior  I have suddenly found myself in need of a new and fully fledged psychiatric service dog-in-training. Many people do not consider a service dog to be a medical necessity for anyone with mental illness  neurological disorders  or sleep disorders but this disability tool will make my life a little less stressful than just taking more pills or upping therapy work. I just do not function well on a lot of medication and with multiple conflicting disorders  it's really difficult to medicate for everything without the meds interacting and making me sicker. I benefit more from having a task-trained dog to monitor my mood and behavior than increasing medication and dealing with uncomfortable side effects. My doctors are behind me on this decision and support me getting and training a new service dog instead of increasing medications.I have struggled with psychiatric illness and neurological illness for many years and adopted my previous support dog Katy about 5 years ago. She was a washed out service dog but still performed her tasks in the home which brought me a lot of comfort and joy as well as relief in my everyday life. As my health worsened though  I found there are some things she could not do for me that a full service dog could. And in protest of having to move into an apartment this year after living in houses the last 5 years  she had stopped performing all service tasks  started lunging and attempting to attack other residents in my building  and even tried attacking me and challenging me for dominance. As much as i loved her  she was becoming a threat to my health and safety as well as the safety of the other residents which is why i had no safe option other than retiring and rehoming her.I did manage to find and bring home a suitable dog that can take over Katy's duties as well as learn new tasks she couldn't do for me but raising a service dog takes a lot of money due to vet needs  training costs  behaviorist and private trainer  training gear  etc... i just need to have enough money set aside to get him through his first year of life (including neutering  1 year vaccinations  flea and tick treatment  etc.). The reason I am training him myself is because here in Northern Indiana  we do not have any training programs specifically for service animals so i would have to move to another state or i would have to get on a several year long waiting list to get a basic trained golden retriever that i would still have to task train for the tasks i specifically need. In the time I'd be waiting for a program trained dog  i could train the breed i specifically need for what i need in that same amount of waiting time. i'm not completely on my own though. once basic obedience is finished  i would be putting him through a more advanced class with a trainer as well as potentially an agility or disc course to get him in good shape for being on his feet with me for a typical work day.I know not everyone recognizes the important impact a service animal can make in someones life but I know through limited experience that a Psychiatric Service Dog will make a stronger impact on my health and stability than just taking pills alone. I'm not just getting a new pet I am regaining an important coping tool to help me get through life with a little less difficulty. Every little bit will help. I also have an amazon wishlist if anyone would like to donate some of the supplies on the list. http://a.co/0te62CYI truly appreciate any help anyone can give me through this process whether it's donating money  donating supplies  or sharing the links on social media for all to see. Thank you for reading and have an amazing day!,470,1500,4,31,11,281,6

Simultaneously (and again  as a social worker) I find myself in positions and fields where the work is tough  strenuous  and rewarding  but the financial compensation is hardly enough to pay my immediate bills and living expenses  let alone save any for important milestones. Lately  and little by little  I've been taking necessary steps to address my own health and happiness  and top surgery is the next big thing on my list of accomplishments I'd like to see happen for myself. Y'all were so generous the first time around when I needed to begin my journey of Hormone Replacement Therapy  and because of the generosity of my friends  family  and community  now over a year and a half into that journey I find myself happier than I've ever been. If you don't have anything to spare  that's perfectly fine. I know how difficult financial situations can be  and have an unfathomable amount of respect for those who live in the humility of living paycheck to paycheck like I do. All I ask for is your support  and to share this if able-- for the more folks this reaches the better my chances are at moving forward with this process. Thank y'all so much. I've been absolutely blown away by the support I've received throughout this entire process  and even if nothing else  the validation I've received from my community alone shows me that I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. Appreciate you all!,2430,5000,14,49,37,188,6

Chemo Treatments for Jessica Rae,https://www.gofundme.com/chemo-treatments-for-jessica-rae,0,POTTSTOWN,PA,"First  Thank you to everyone who has donated to help Jessica!  Your time  prayers and gift are very appreciated!  October 24  2018 - update:  Jessica still does not have a decision on chemo treatment.  There is no  Avastin planned for  October 26th - a second treatment missed.   Monday  October 22  2018  on the phone we had a representative from Caremark Pharmacy  a Nurse Navigator from Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and a Nurse Navigator from Health Advocates from the employer  Blue Shield Pre Cert specialist  Jessica and her Mom.  After 1 hour 20 minute call no decision could be made sadly.Cancer Treatment Centers of America advised on October 23   2018  their team won't  see Jessica now until they can evaluate her \HEALTH iNSURANCE \"" status on November 1st and won't be able to see her for 6 - 8 additional weeks.  Their team without seeing her or viewing records has decided they do not agree with the current treatment plan.  Glioblastoma tumors spread quickly and are the most invasive type of brain tumor. Due to the severity of a GBM-4  we needed to act immediately to keep the tumor from spreading....WE MUST GET STARTED!Any donation big or small is greatly appreciated! Jessica has  missed her second dose of Avastin that was due October 12  2018  due to specialty pharmacy and hospital rules.   We are trying so hard to find a new place to go but until then we need help to pay the costs privately.  The cost of the drug only - every 2 weeks is $2 000+ and not including infusion services.Avastin is the last chemo drug for Jessica. We've been told by the University of Pennsylvania to find another place to go for the drug and its infusion .  Cancer Treatment centers of America has the drug approved for her if we can get to Chicago but are trying to see if we can get the Avastin at their Pennsylvania center.   Tower Health Pottstown's Cancer Center has agreed to see her on Friday  October 19th but they do not have a neuro oncologist only general oncology.Jessica is 37 and the squirt with her in the photos is Hannah Rose her 10 year old daughter.    Diagnosed 4 months after her father passed away from primary  first generation  Glioblastoma in 1999 and 2 months before graduating high school  Jessica underwent surgery for her first HEREDITARY tumor in 2004 and was left paralyzed on the left side.  With physical therapy and a few weeks her leg returned followed by the left arm.  Yes  anyone reading this BRAIN TUMORS CAN BE HEREDITARY!! DO GET YOUR CHILDREN CHECKED. Jessica has had several tumor surgeries and radiation treatments since 2004 at the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson University.  January 2017 saw a change in the cells from benign to oligodendroglioma (grade 2).  The next 11 months were spent on Temodar an oral chemotherapy with the last of those months adding a second chemo drug  Lomustine.  Neither were able to stop the development of yet another tumor.Jessica kept saying something was “different or wrong” but it wasn't showing on the MRI's so the standard chemo continued until August 3  2018 when the tumor lit up on a follow up MRI in the matter of weeks.  A 4th craniotomy was done on August 23  2018.  A week later pathology was Glioblastoma (grade 4).   I think even the doctors were Rebuilding a life time and time again  Jessica is and has been a strong young woman  owning a home now sold and living with her mother and step father  raising a child alone and working full-time during and through every ordeal. Jessica is worthy of a chance at good care that could leave her able to be alive and being a Mom raising her daughter Hannah.  Life is never the same after brain surgery  for anyone  something is always different and we’ve been blessed to still be in this journey but we shouldn't have to lose due to arbitrary rules of hospitals and insurance companies.                                                                                     ...""",5900,50000,17,12,45,179,6
Liver For Tina Reed!,https://www.gofundme.com/liverfortinareed,0,WILKESBARRE,PA,Hey guys! So my sister and myself have been going back and forth on how to help my mom  and tho this isn’t the way we want. We feel due to my moms physical  mental and emotional state this is the best way to start! My mother; Tina Reed; has been suffering from liver problem since she was a teenager. Later in life she found out she also had Crohn’s Disease  an aneurysm  along with having her thyroid removed. So to the say the least my mom is a fighter. There isn’t a day that goes by that she didn’t put everyone else before her. No matter who or what is was if you needed her she would do everything to help. Her famous quote she always told was “ Living the Dream!” I truly think she is living the Dream because she wouldn’t have it any other way than to help as many people as possible. But in July her dream  came to sudden stop. She found out she had liver failure and if she didn’t get a transplant or someone donate a piece of theirs to help  she wouldn’t make it....  if you had seen my mom before or during you would have had no idea. But over the last couple weeks Mrs. Tina just hasn’t been herself. Barely able to get out of the house  eat any foods  or just get up to make herself food has become a daily challenge. Today we were officially notified that she got the GREEN LIGHT to get a transplant as soon as one becomes available. With the forecast of lost of medical bills  hotels for family members  travel expenses to see her in Philadelphia  and any medications. We are asking for any help from anyone  anything helps! We have been told the procedure with cost over $650k. ( so gofundme wants me to put a number to reach and I’m really not sure ) We thank you guys for always sticking with our crazy family! We appreciate all the support and prayers for her. - REED FAMILY!,5270,10000,9,53,53,491,6

Drexel Dragon Claws,https://www.gofundme.com/drexel-dragon-claws,7,PHILADELPHIA,PA,What is Drexel Dragon Claws?Drexel Dragon Claws is a graduate student-run organization that provides free 3D printed task-specific devices to upper-limb amputation patients in the Greater Philadelphia area. Drexel Dragon Claws is a recognized chapter of the e-NABLE community  a global network of volunteers who create free 3D printed upper-limb prosthetics for patients in need of assistive devices. Why do we do It?Patients in need of prosthetic devices have limited options due to high prosthetic device costs and limited insurance coverage. Pediatric patients  in particular  require frequent fitting and resizing  which exacerbates the cost barrier. Using 3D printing  we can offer an affordable and accessible option for these patients.What have we done? Last year  we developed a device for a local child who wanted to play the violin but was unable to hold the bow due to a congenital reduction in his right hand. Our team collaborated with the patient and his music teacher to test multiple prototypes until the optimal device was created in time for his spring concert. Our project was recently featured in a local news segment. Why do we need your help? As word of our group has spread  additional patients have reached out to us with similar requests for personalized prosthetic devices. Unfortunately  we can only accommodate two new patients at a time due to our limited printing resources. As a self-funded team  we are asking for support so we can expand our free services to additional patients.The single personal printer we currently use is unable to meet the growing volume of work that comes with each new patient. The funds we raise will be used to purchase an additional 3D printer and the necessary materials to develop assistive devices for the increasing number of patients.Every donation counts! Your contribution will help bring independence and hope to patients and their families.,5250,5000,16,105,55,228,6
Help Carie to Conquer Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/the-carie-jolley-medical-fund,1,MURFREESBORO,TN,Hi. My name is Carie Jolley.  I live  work  and worship in Murfreesboro  TN. My children and I have attended North Boulevard Church of Christ for the past six years. I LOVE LIFE  and our sweet life sure does have its ups and downs and all arounds. Here is my story.  I would love your prayers  support  and help any way you can. My world was going awesome with an amazing husband and two lovable children who are 12 and 9 now. I had a good job and nice house with the thoughts of building a new place to call our own. But things took a Great Big spin  and on June 18  2015  I received a diagnoses that I never thought would happen to ME. The news from my doctor was   “The results are in  and I’m sorry to say it’s positive. YOU HAVE stage III breast cancer.” I was numb for so so long and wondered how can this be. NO ONE in my family has had cancer  and I am only 35 years old. It really stung to know I was the start of that ugly statistic in our family line. For a while  I cried more about that than the actual cancer. But I gathered my composure and pressed forward. My husband and I gathered a lot of information during several scary doctor visits and heavy burdensome decisions.  We decided to go the holistic route. YES  that is out of the box  and so many questioned our decision  but I had a deep desire within me guiding me the entire process. GOD IS MY GREAT PHYSICIAN. Moving forward  my cancer was reversed in 9 months in March 2016!!!!! I was on top of the world and so excited to be free of this burden that takes so many lives. Life was good! But  another storm came marching in not long after that spinning my life out of control once again.  After months of torture to myself losing my husband through divorce  I once again gathered my composure and said there is more to life  and my two children are worth fighting for.I went to my Oncologist for a biopsy in February 2017 to see if the cancer was still gone. It was NOT  and the breast cancer came back with vengeance and spread to the bones of my body. This was hard to hear  but I knew exactly what needed to be done. I did it once  I can do it again!!! I am strong  bold  capable  stubborn and so full of life that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me! I geared up and have been living a great quality of life up to last month (August 2018). My body was not doing well and started holding fluid retention. To me I see this as a great reward because it was my body telling me it’s time to do something different. I dug deep  and I am currently seeing my Oncologist who has changed some things and also see a Doctor in Brentwood that administers IV Therapies three times a week. The cost in supplements  travel  actual IV treatments and seeing the doctor for follow ups are NOT covered by insurance. And my insurance deductible is $6K plus coinsurance cost and this has surpassed the limit this year with ER visits  CT scans  x-rays  bloodwork/labs and lots of doctor visits. Being a single mom with two kids and fighting a terminal cancer has been overwhelming but I know  there are possibilities all around me. Although I'm a full time employee  I have been out of work the last 4 weeks and anticipate being off longer until my stamina and strength returns  which means no income for the upcoming weeks.Thank you so much for all your prayers.  I prayer your heart leads you to donate and support me on my path to being cancer free again. God BlessCarie Jolley,6755,20000,12,34,33,208,6
Life Changing Wheelchair Van For Marty and Jake,https://www.gofundme.com/wheelchair-van-for-marty-amp-jacob,0,EFFORT,PA,"ALMOST THERE!! As a father of Six I feel so blessed. Many of you have shared this campaign and helped our two boys realize their dream of getting a Wheelchair Van. This summer  because of you  Martin & Jacob will get to see the Grand Canyon  See the Pacific Ocean  Visit Tombstone and hopefully Visit @Blizzard Entertainment in California. But before all that happens we will now be able to do simple things like go to Church  visit the doctors and just go out for a sunday drive. This is all because of people like you that took the time to help us raise the money we need to get a Wheelchair Van. God Bless you and thanks for sharing our story.We are almost at our Goal- Thank you so much - Please Share this with your friends- God Bless!When our family first started this campaign I prayed to God. I asked the Lord for enough to help our two boys get the wheelchair van they needed.  Never did I expect a Miracle to happen -This was not the first time God let me know that He was listening. In my early 20's while praying to God for a sick Family Member while driving to the store  I stopped my prayer and simply asked God  \Do you hear me  are you listening to a  word I'm saying?\"" I parked my car at the supermarket next to BlockBuster Video and went in for a few items and came out to find a pamphlet on my wiper- it said  \""I hear you and I'm listening \"" I looked at other vehicles around mine and on the ground and needless to say there wasn't one other car with that pamphlet on it. It took years of prayer but that family member did overcome his alcoholism. I never gave up that God would one day answer my prayers. When we started this Campaign we didn't expect to get a $31 250 donation - Nothing like that crossed our minds but with God anything is possible.  Marty & Jacob are blessed to have recieved a $31 250 donation from Karl & Michele Rothacker and Dan & Tish Blasdell - Words cannot express our thanks.****Update - Thank you to our church for the generous donation. ******We would also like to thank everyone who has helped us get to this point in our campaign- Without you none of this would have been possible. I know that God is listening and this time He has sent all of you  His angels  to help our sons.God Bless And Thank You!We just put a Down Payment on our Sons new Wheelchair van- But still have a a little bit ways to go.We will have an update on the actual cost this week- Then the fun part of waiting for our Sons Insurance to cover the cost of the Modification - We are Very close to what we need- Please Spread the word and help us reach our goal- Please read our story below- God Bless and Thank You!--The hardest part of having children with Muscular Dystrophy is the pain it inflicts on our soul- You always ask yourself Can I Do more? Am I doing Enough? Did I make the right decisions to better my children's lives? I feel as if I am always struggling inside  yelling at myself to do more  to be better  to fight harder for my kids.  But it would be a lie to say i'm not mentally exhausted...       Like any parent I would do anything for my children and that anything has led me to the conclusion that I need help from outside forces.  Simple things like going to a movie  getting to a doctors appointment  going to church or just going for a Sunday drive have now all but become near impossible without the proper vehicle.     My son Martin (23) has a tracheotomy and breathes with the assistance of a machine and eats through a feeding tube. My son Jacob (14) has just stopped walking about a year and a half ago and is now in a wheelchair full time.       Getting A wheelchair van that could fit two wheelchairs would open up a whole  new world for our sons Marty & Jake.   Putting my sons chairs in manually up ramps into our 1999 Suburban that is not equipped for wheelchairs these past 10 years plus has caused me 15+ tears  in my shoulder  abdominal hernia  two bulging discs and endless concerns that I may not be able to help them much longer- I truly feel like I am falling apart piece by piece.     My older son Marty asked me in the past to consider a Gofundme page to help raise funds for a wheelchair van but I allowed my pride to prevent me from putting his needs first-  I was too proud to ask for help but now I realize that without your help we could not  achieve our goal.   We will use the proceeds to purchase a  van like the one below. ***If you cannot donate please pray for our family.  With God all things are possible.***** I am also open to any suggestions that might help us reach our goal   -Thank You  The Wierzba Family""",36614,44000,6,83,45,658,6

Medical Expenses For Stella Jean,https://www.gofundme.com/u82y8h-medical-bills,9,LINCOLN,NE,Stella Jean Rison was born July 30th  2018. We knew she would be born a unique little girl from the beginning. At our 20 week anatomy scan we found out she would be born with a brain malformation  one working kidney  and a possible heart defect. At 9:52 she was brought into the world and was admitted to the NICU for evaluation. She had a scan of her heart and they didn’t see the same things that they had seen in utero  things looked better! We spent 4 days in the NICU and were able to leave the hospital and go home together. Days and weeks went by and everything seemed good. She was admitted to the hospital for possible seizure on September 3rd. We have had a bumpy road since then. On September 20th we had an ultrasound of her heart and it showed a large hole and pulmonary hypertension. Less than a week later we were admitted because she was struggling to breathe. She became worse very quickly. She is now on life support and fighting for her life. Dr. Hammel performed a heart surgery that he had only done on one other baby and it has only ever been done 50 times in the world. We are fighting the pulmonary hypertension and if it doesn’t come down we are out of options. Our biggest thing we are asking people is to pray for Stella. We pray that she continues to fight. We also ask for prayers for her family.,3720,5000,9,74,61,582,6

Isabella&apos;s Medical &amp; Therapy Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/isabellagrace-medical-therapy-fund,7,SORRENTO,FL,This is a campaign for our daughter Isabella Grace to help with payments of medical bills for her welfare and well-being.Isabella Grace was diagnosed just a few months after birth with Cerebral Palsy. She later was also diagnosed with Autism. Isabella never hit any of her milestones but she surprisingly walked when she was 2 years of age  although weaker on the left side of her body and crossed eyed on that side also. She now wears glasses that helps to correct her vision and crossed eye and over the past 6 years now has blessed us both so much with love and precious moments and memories. She is nonverbal but loves to hum to music. She has sensory issues to touch  noise  different sounds  crowds of people and sometimes flashing lights. She is allergic to dairy and has inflammatory problems with gut and colon. She also has trouble swallowing textured foods.We later took her to a feeding clinic that has a program which teaches kids to swallow and become familiar with textures of varies foods. She has done very well this past year. She is now eating textured food of some sort but has ways to go. She is learning to self-feed with her favorite foods like oatmeal and nondairy yogurts. She does not use her thumb and index finger when trying to grasp an object and she isn't potty trained still as of yet.The expenses are overwhelming us alone from the feeding program. She hasn't had any Behavioral  Speech or Occupational therapies since turning three years old apart from what she may get in school. We want to get her back on track and keep improving but haven't caught up on the medical expenses that are driving us in debt. Insurance doesn't seem to take the cake just the icing of the bill and the weight of the expenses are left on us. So we can't start her on any other needed therapies for possible improvement that would have a great effect on her and benefit her needs.We are humble and in need and ask for any help and generosity in donations in any way and thank each person in advance for anything that they can do. Thank you again for the opportunity and taking the time to read her story.,1724,15000,7,11,19,233,6

Jeff Baker,https://www.gofundme.com/jeff-baker,9,ROME,NY,My name is Autumn and I am the oldest daughter of Jeff Baker. We live in Rome  NY and Jeff is now at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse  NY on the ICU floor. He has had multiple blood tests  ct scans  IV's for fluids  insulin  antibiotics  a biopsy and an x-ray. Since coming to Upstate they have found that he is severely dehydrated  hives from medication  3 IV's blown  stone in his gallbladder  kidney infection  blood in his urine  mass on his liver and diabetic ketoacidosis. Friday afternoon he had a biopsy on the mass located on his liver. On the way back to his room he started to crash and went septic from the biopsy. They were able to get him stabilized and comfortable. Saturday they found out he has E-coli and placed a pic-line in him. They have done another ct scan to look at the mass on his liver to monitor the size while waiting for the results. Today they did an x-ray on his lungs and found fluid in his left lung which explains why he is having a hard time breathing. This is causing mucus and his asthma to act up. It's a lot of waiting to see what they are dealing with. Jeff is the sole provider for himself  Phyllis and his 3 grandchildren since the tragic loss of Brittany in March of 2017. He has been out of work for over a week now and no money coming in. Many of you may know Jeff from hockey which is his second family. Jeff is always willing to go play with anyone  for anyone and anywhere. Whether it's in Rome  Whitestown  Clinton  Morrisville or in the Barn Jeff is there ready to play. We aren't sure when he will be having surgery or to even leave the hospital. I know he is eager to get back to his normal life where he is working  providing and playing the sport he loves. I am trying to do this for him so that he can focus on getting better. I appreciate all the love and warn wishes for my dad and I know he does so keep them coming.,7797,10000,21,78,126,349,6
Help Scott Heal,https://www.gofundme.com/6ta8a-help-scott-heal,0,OKLAHOMACITY,OK,I have heard it said many different times in many different ways that we (Americans) are but one illness away from financial ruin. It’s sad  but most of us do not understand this until we are in the midst of a crisis. We all prepare the best we can with health insurance  long-term disability  and life insurance to protect our castles we have built and the lifestyle our loved ones have grown accustomed. Unfortunately  the best laid plans often go awry. No one tells you that if you have an illness that extends more than a few weeks that you will be looking at friends and family to help shoulder the burden of your finances until you are well or you have drained them to the point of financial ruin too. My friend  Scott Cloos  is one of the many people in America to experience such a situation. He was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma  a benign brain tumor  about three years ago. The doctors advised against surgery due to likely facial paralysis and the tumor’s close proximity to his brain stem. Proton therapy was recommended.  After months of appeals and a second opinion  the insurance company denied proton therapy.  Another form of radiation treatment was used as the next best option and was the best course of action  according to an insurance company  for the advancing symptoms.  Over the last three years  this man has gotten up and gone to work despite the balance problems  loss of hearing in one ear  extreme headaches  nausea  and numbness of his face. The tumor has started growing again after his one  and only  radiation treatment in 2016. The past two plus years  he and his wife  Marla  have been to numerous doctors  including The Mayo Clinic  looking for answers and a medical miracle. At some point  the tumor will grow to a point where it crushes his brain stem. This of course will result in his demise.Recently  Scott was referred to an ENT (Ear  Nose  and Throat) surgeon at OU Medical Center that has extensive experience with acoustic neuromas. She  along with her Neurosurgeon associate both agree that they can remove enough of Scott’s tumor to lessen the pressure on his brain stem and hopefully provide some relief  while preserving as much nerve function as possible. This is the miracle they  and everyone that knows them  have been waiting and praying for since his diagnosis. The surgery is scheduled for Friday  November 9th. Scott will be incapacitated for at least 3-6 months while recovering from the surgery and in rehabilitation to retrain his brain. He will forfeit any remaining hearing in the ear affected by the acoustic neuroma  necessitating new or updated hearing aids  a complete out-of-pocket expense. This recovery and rehab time  which is much needed  is a source of anxiety for Scott. He has medical insurance and a disability plan through work that will help  but neither will cover everything. I am not asking that a few people give a lot of money  I am asking that a lot of people give a little money to help a dad  husband  brother  friend  stranger in need. He has done everything to avoid being disabled and your gift would help him get back on his feet quickly. People used to come together as a community to support someone in need by providing meals for the family and helping to keep their house in order until they were able to handle their affairs again on their own. I’m asking that you simply gift them enough to buy a meal for two  $25 and share his story. If 100 people respond with a gift that would be great  250 people would be outstanding!May God bless the hands of Scott’s surgeons and all of you praying and helping Scott and his family financially through this health crisis.,2935,5000,23,59,49,117,6

Deb&apos;s Reclining Wheelchair (&amp; Bed),https://www.gofundme.com/deb039s-reclining-wheelchair-amp-bed,7,MILFORD,CT,"Hello  everyone. I'm Phil  and this is Deb (picture). We're asking for contributions to make it possible for Deb to have a wheelchair which (a) has an ergonomic seat to hold her spine firmly against the back of the chair  and (b) reclines  so that she can spend much more time out of bed.Since 2004  Deb has been confined to bed rest to manage severe back pain. (Treatment involves horizontal rest  physical therapy  and way too much pain medication.) This will be the case for all the rest of her life.Her condition results from very extensive fusion during scoliosis surgery  by Dr. Robert B. Winter of Minnesota  when she was thirteen years old. The fusion runs from the 5th Thoracic vertebra down to the 4th Lumbar vertebra & is supported by 2 Harrington Rods. Several Orthopedic surgeons  including a team from the Philadelphia’s Rothman Institute  have determined that surgery cannot improve her condition  but would only increase her pain. Eventually Deb will lose bowel and bladder control and may lose all ability to move her lower body. Per her doctors  it is always hard to predict exactly how the nerves in the spine will react to damage. The uncertainty adds stress for us all.For now  we know that the Lumbar vertebrae have become ground down; the disks are collapsing in various ways.They have become herniated and bulging  with the edges getting \bitten\"" off by the increasingly sharpened edges of the vertebrae as she moves. She has lost almost two inches in height as the neural spaces have collapsed. She is able to stand for a few minutes each day  with accompanying increased pain  to use the bathroom and to get water and pre-prepared fruit. Sitting up is easier  but any upright posture puts weight on the deteriorating vertebrae and nerves. Following any sitting or prolonged standing  she will be in significant additional pain for a day or even two.  Taking breaks by laying down helps  but is not always possible depending on where she is.Our goal is to allow her as much time as possible out of bed. She has lived like this for the last fourteen years (since she was 43 years old). She misses spending time crafting  quilting  visiting friends & family  going to church  and even going to a movie at the theater. (Deb notes: \""Just having the flexibility to sit/lay down in the sun would be a joy.\"") The doctors would like to see her spend more time out of bed. In order to allow her to do so  she needs to be able to lie back and take the weight off the spine at need. Her regular chair is an ergonomic lightweight model manufactured by Kaman  which has proven extremely comfortable. We would like to stick with the Kaman ergonomic design for the seat and lower chair back  since it has worked so well for her.However  with the continued deterioration of her spine  the basic ergonomic wheelchair is no longer enough for her to be up for long. We  and her doctors  have strong reason to believe that the Kaman Reclining Ergonomic Wheelchair will allow her much more freedom from bed  due to being able to lie back without being in bed (and without having to maneuver to and fro to leave a wheelchair  or leave a gathering to find a bedroom when visiting).Our goal is the Karman MVP-502 Lightweight Ergonomic Reclining Wheelchair  by reason of greater comfort than other competitors. For the last several years  her maximum time out of bed has been steadily declining; her doctors suggested that a comfortable reclining chair will make all of the difference in her ability to be up and increasing her participation in family and social matters to a much greater degree. While she will not regain full mobility  we all expect a dramatic increase in her mental well-being. In addition  being more active will reduce the chances of a pulmonary embolism  a frequently fatal variety of blood clot.The cost of chair plus stabilizers to prevent backwards tilt is about $2200. We expect to contribute as much as possible  and are working to save money toward this value. We would be very grateful for any help which our friends  relatives  and acquaintances are comfortable providing.  Our insurance is extremely 'spotty' in regards to wheelchairs  frustratingly covering only certain model & sizes; we will naturally seek reimbursement  but are not optimistic about succeeding. ============In addition  having been in bed more than twenty-three hours of every day since 2004 has had the effect of approximately tripling the normal wear on our bed. The bed  a Select Comfort (Sleep Number) king size  has held up remarkably well in view of this - think of it as having had over 40 years of normal use. After this time  it is badly deteriorated and frequently does not provide support for Deb to rest in comfortable positions. We are currently looking into affordable replacements  preferably with an elevating base  so that she has the ability to elevate her upper body slightly when she is in bed. With this change  she can read & watch videos without prism glasses  she can enjoy speaking with guests and rest in greater comfort.Any funds over the cost of the wheelchair will be devoted to buying a replacement for the current bed  as described here.Thank you for your consideration.--Deborah Lambert-Sevetson and Phil Sevetson""",3700,4000,14,93,12,60,5

Friends Create Jon Olson Trust,https://www.gofundme.com/friends-create-jon-olson-trust,7,UNIVERSITYPARK,PA,"As you may know  our friend and colleague Jon Olson had an accident earlier this summer that has left him quadriplegic. As a result  Jon and his spouse Cheryl Glenn urgently need our help.On June 26  2018 Jon suffered a freak accident while vacationing with Cheryl and several friends.   At the time  the accident appeared to be significant but not catastrophic.  On July 18  2018 however  paralysis set in. Jon is currently pursuing intense physical therapy in Jefferson Hospital’s Magee Spinal Rehab Clinic in Philadelphia.   Jon  with Cheryl’s unflagging help  is now preparing for a new and radically restricted life  one where he is unable to feed himself  hold a book  and do all the things most of us take for granted.  We all pray for some return of function  and there are positive signs—the most important of which is Jon himself and his remarkable response to his accident.  His spirit is strong and optimistic.  But both Jon and Cheryl must plan for a future very different from the one they had previously imagined.Fortunately  Jon and Cheryl are not without resources.  Unlike too many of our fellow citizens  Jon has health insurance as well as long-term care insurance.  But even with these resources  Jon is facing huge and ongoing expenses that could quickly deplete his and Cheryl’s savings. Jon  for example  will need 24-hour care for the foreseeable future.In short  Jon’s accident is truly a catastrophic  life-changing event that will require resources long into the future that go well beyond those available to Jon. Cheryl and Jon have sold their home  which is no longer accessible for Jon  and are in the process of retrofitting a single level condominium.  In addition to home care  they will need to purchase expensive equipment  such as a patient transfer system  specialized wheelchairs  and so on (for more about quadriplegia and its personal and familial impact  please consult this site.After consulting with Cheryl and Jon  and with the help of State College lawyer Amos Goodall (a member of the Special Needs Alliance  a national practice group)  we have established a third party (inter vivos) trust fund to support Jon’s ongoing needs.  All monies generated through your generous donations to this GoFundMe campaign will go into a trust managed by the Achieva Family Trust  a nonprofit group founded in 1951 by a family who wanted to ensure that members of their family with disabilities could have the same chances in life that all should be given.  The sole purpose of the Trust is to provide for Jon’s needs to supplement but not replace what he is eligible for from insurance and other programs.  Based on Cheryl and Jon’s consultations with staff at Magee  we know that these needs will be considerable.  For more information about Achieva  please consult this website.  Jon will return home from Magee in a few weeks.  His mind is clear and active  and his spirit astonishingly positive and generous.  Please match Jon’s spirit with your own generosity by joining what we’re thinking of as Team Jon.  We deeply appreciate your support!PS:  If you want to bypass GoFundMe and make a direct contribution  write a check to \Achieva Family Trust FBO Jon Olson\"" and mail to:  Achieva Family Trustc/o Jacquelyn E.

(dysplasia - a problem with the hip joints.)  We have found a hospital to cover his medical care but we need to raise funds for travel expenses and room and board while in the States. The treatment may require two visits to the US.  Because he is not able to take pain medications  it is urgent that we bring him soon and we want to raise these funds by Thanksgiving or at most  the end of November. Our churches will be working directly and personally with the family.Would you help to help this family in need back in our Albanian homeland?  We greatly appreciate your care  concern and generosity and we know the family will for sure as we help give this young boy a new start for a healthy and happy life ahead with his mom and dad.,14635,20000,3,73,112,3000,6

Denise&apos;s Cancer Fight Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/denise039s-cancer-fight-fund,1,RENO,NV,Denise and her sweet family are source of incredible positivity and kindness in their community. They have served in ministry in Reno for almost 5 years. But beyond that  Denise has gone out of her way to offer hope to others through selfless gestures. Last year  Denise became a surrogate to help her friends realize their dream of being parents. While delivering her friends’ baby girl via C-section  it was discovered that she had a rare form of cancer in one of her tubes. Though the news came as a shock  Denise’s outlook was nothing but positive telling people that had she not been a surrogate or had a C-section  the cancer would not have been found and what a miracle it was that it worked out the way it did. Denise went through various medical tests to see if and how much the cancer spread and a date for surgery was set.Going into surgery  it seemed like the cancer was slow-growing and small  so it would be a simple procedure to remove what cancer was there  and Denise would be on a quick road to recovery; however  when the doctor performed the surgery  he found the cancer had spread throughout her abdomen. Due to the rarity of this type of cancer  Denise will need to undergo more surgeries and a special form of chemotherapy out of state.Though Denise and Michael remain positive and continue to move forward with hope  the unknowns are overwhelming and the medical bills are rising. Michael has just gone back to school online through Bethel Seminary  and Denise works for a non-profit in town that serves victims of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking  and they have two small children. While they go through the fight against cancer  the last thing we want them to worry about is finances. Please consider donating to help this sweet family cover the costs of Denise’s medical care. Even the smallest amount is an enormous help.,33640,100000,14,34,118,636,6

Moving Mountains for Emily,https://www.gofundme.com/moving-mountains-for-emily,6,CHARLOTTE,NC,Cancer is a lot of things including very costly to treat.  Help us in supporting Emily Archer for any unexpected expenses such as travel requirements to and from Duke University monthly for clinical trials which Emily will need to undergo as a part of her treatment. Examples of these potential costs include gas  hotels stay while at Duke and expenses for food.  Please accept a huge thank you to everyone that has extended support and concern thus far and a huge thank you to those that will.  The next few months to year will no doubt be very difficult for Emily and her family but we know that Emily will pull through with flying colors! Let’s all remember that strength doesn’t come from what you can do it comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn’t!Technical details: Emily was diagnosed in 2015 and had a brain tumor resection that diagnosed it as a Grade 2 astrocytoma. She went symptom free for almost 3 years as it was monitored. Early this year she starting experiencing symptoms along with gradual recurrence of the tumor (this was expected). Since she was symptomatic  her doctors wanted to pursue next steps as part of her standard of care. She was also eligible for a clinic trial at her hospital that incorporates a vaccine targeting a specific genetic mutation that is linked to brain tumors that she has chosen to pursue. She is about 9 weeks into the study and will begin a year long course of chemo  coupled with monthly vaccinations post surgery. Emily recently had her surgery on 9/26/18 and to no one’s surprise  Emily is a ROCKSTAR even when it comes to this major brain surgery! The next day just 24 hours later  she was released post-op. She was then able to come home Saturday 9/29  -just 3 days after she had surgery! Now today  she is walking and talking way better than expected for her recovery.  She is scheduled to go back up to Duke 10/10/18 for a follow up to determine if she is ready to start the chemo which is expected to start in October. Sharing her story and GoFundMe page would be greatly appreciated as well.  However you can show your support and love   Emily will be stronger because of it and have a better chance at pulling through this recovery!,3200,7000,18,46,31,109,6
Cocca Family IVF Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/cocca,0,ANAHEIM,CA,"In September of 2014 Sean and I met like most couples do these days-- via the internet. We both are no stranger to the usual awkwardness of online dating  and were instantly relieved that this wasn't going to be another cringe worthy date that we'd end up sharing with our friends the next day. We ended up going on dates for 19 days straight  and on the evening of that last date he asked me to be his girlfriend  and as we say the rest is history. Sean proposed on January 11  2016  while we were on vacation in Maui-- a trip we'll never forget.We were married on October 7  2017 surrounded by 112 of our closest friends and family  and it was easily the best day of our lives.After our dream wedding we knew we wanted to start trying to build our family from just the two of us  and did what most call \not trying not preventing\"" for almost 7 months after we were married. We remained as optimistic as possible as we knew it could take up to one year for couples to conceive naturally. However  since nothing was happening and I was beginning to panic (like I do)  we decided to take the next step and start tracking my cycles. This meant taking my temperature at the same time every day  tracking ovulation by OPKs (ovulation prediction kits)  and so much more. After 3 months of tracking it was decided we should do some testing to rule out any common issues that couples can face while trying to conceive. One of these tests is a sperm analysis which gives cheap and quick results. Four days after the test was completed is when we were hit with the devastating news-- Sean had zero sperm count. Sean's doctor immediately suggested a second sperm analysis for him  and for us to find a fertility urologist as he would no longer be able to help Sean with our endeavor to conceive. At the end of August Sean and I met with his urologist and he believes that Sean has congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. This affects only 1-2% of the population in the world. Not only does this mean that we could no longer conceive naturally and that IVF was our only path to a biological child  but that Sean is also a carrier for cystic fibrosis  which is an inherited life-threatening disorder that damages both the lungs and digestive system. Because of the news from Sean's urologist we immediately sought out help from a reproductive endocrinologist  and settled upon Dr. Sanaz Ghazal at HRC Fertility in Newport Beach. The clinic we have chosen has some of the highest success rates in the nation for women of my age. It’s a no brainer for us to choose treatment with Dr. Ghazal  as her warmth of character and approach to infertility is exactly what we are looking for.Only 15 out of 50 states have infertility insurance laws. In California the law only requires group insurers to offer coverage of IVF. Employers may choose whether or not to include infertility coverage as part of their employee health benefit package. Neither Sean nor I have any infertility coverage because our employers have chosen to not include it as part of their benefits package.For some insight  1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility. 1/3rd is female-factory only  1/3rd is male factor-only  and 1/3rd is a combination of male and female factor. At this time in our process we are only aware of the male factor component  and we are waiting on my initial testing results.While the emotional and physical toll of infertility is something we are learning to cope with as time progresses  we are not prepared for the financial burden of what is ahead of us. For those interested in costs  this is what we are looking at spending for a single cycle of IVF treatment with HRC Fertility:$308.50 for pre-IVF testing$350 for genetic screening to rule out autosomal recessive inheritance (cystic fibrosis  fragile X  etc.)$3 000 for Sean's TESE (surgery required for sperm extraction)$9 200 for IVF$1 600 for ICSI (sperm injection into egg)$5 050 for PGS embryo screening (to rule out chromosomal issues)$1 470 for embryo and sperm storage (annual fee)$3 000-$7 000 for required prescription drugs$570 for anesthesia for egg retrieval$360 for FET (frozen embryo transfer)Total: $22 208.50 - $26 208.50Now that we have the team of doctors we need to help us conceive  we are now looking for any help from our family and friends that can be provided.  Any donation is greatly appreciated and received with a whole lot of love. We hope to begin our first IVF cycle between fall 2018 and winter 2019.""",4000,15000,13,27,31,184,6

Help the Fagaly family,https://www.gofundme.com/hkx3rh,5,ESCONDIDO,CA,Hi everyone  my name is Matt Fagaly. I’m 29 year old  mixed Filipinx  and I come from a family of 6. My dad (Bruce Fagaly)  mom  and brother Jacob live in Escondido  CA together  while my brother Tim lives in San Diego  and my sister Sarah lives elsewhere in Escondido. On Friday night around 8pm  my 69 year old dad got into a terrible car accident. He had likely fallen asleep at the wheel due to most likely a heart attack  and rammed into another car  which hit another car in front. My dad’s heart had stopped for 25 seconds and they had to perform CPR to revive him. He barely made it that night after waiting hours to be admitted into the emergency room at Palomar Hospital. Since then  he’s had a pacemaker implanted  and today underwent a surgery to get 2 stents put in  but the surgery lasted hours longer because the doctors discovered he needed 3 more stents than they originally thought (which brought it to a total of 5). With our family car wrecked  ambulance bills  two surgeries  and an extended stay at the hospital (my dad is still in the hospital and won’t be discharged til tomorrow at earliest)  we’re going to have a lot to pay. At this point I’d say $25 000 is a rough estimate. My dad is the sole income provider for my mom and my brother Jacob  and they rely on him for financial sustenance. He won’t be able to work for some time  if ever  so me and my siblings are doing my best to make sure he’s properly cared for  along with our mom and brother Jacob. We’re not a family with affluence or a large collective income at all (one sibling has been unemployed for a year  one brother works in retail  and my sister just recently obtained a decent job)  so any and all help would be appreciated. Please donate what you can  and if you can’t  please share with your networks. ￼￼￼,12400,25000,22,50,139,360,6

Help us save Pe&apos;er&apos;s Life,https://www.gofundme.com/help-us-save-pe039er039s-life,8,RALEIGH,NC,Hello Friends and Family: I am helping a childhood friend of mine  David MorHaim  to raise money in order to save his son Pe'er's life.David and I grew up together in Be'er Sheva  Israel.  David was always there for me throughout my childhood and it is now my opportunity to help him save his son's life. Please take a minute and read David's story.  My name is David  and my wife  Hen  and I would like to share with you a personal story about our 3-year-old boy  Pe'er.  A couple of months ago  Pe'er was diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of his kidneys  and since that day  all of our lives have completely changed.First  Pe'er is going through several rounds of invasive and grueling treatments which include the removal of the infected kidney  chemotherapy  and radiation.Additionally  both Hen and I have been forced to quit our jobs so that our time is fully dedicated to Pe'er’s care. As such  we are under considerable financial stress and are not able to provide for our family’s most basic needs.Third  the cost of Pe'er's treatments have become such a huge physical  emotional  and financial burden on our family that we can no longer afford to pay for his therapy.Finally  Hen is 8 months pregnant  which is an undeniable blessing  but comes with its own set of additional medical and financial needs that have strained our family to the to the point of exhaustion.Since we have expended all of our resources in the State of Israel  we have contacted our dear friend  Israel Abitbol  to help spread Pe'er's story.  We would like to humbly ask you to consider helping us through this incredibly difficult time by making a financial contribution to help cover the costs of Pe'er's ongoing treatments.  We currently need to raise over 1 000 000 Israeli Shekel (about $280 000 USD) to cover Pe'er's treatments and medications.  No gift is too small  and we truly appreciate any contributions more than we can adequately express in this brief letter.Thank you so much for your consideration.Israel  David  Hen  and Pe'er,6817,10000,31,68,80,102,6

Aiden&apos;s Top Surgery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/aidenstopsurgeryfund,6,NASHVILLE,TN,My name is Aiden Allison  I'm an 18 year old transgender man  and on December 21st  I'm getting top surgery. For the past 4 years of my life  even doing things as simple as going jogging  swimming  and exercising have been impossible for me due to the issues that come with binding. Even going out in public every day makes me feel deeply insecure  something that binding cannot fix. Something  I am very passionate about is playing in the marching band  and my dream is to be in a world class Drum Corps. But until my surgery  that dream is not something that I can achieve. This surgery will allow me to exercise and march  and more importantly  it will help me be able to  feel secure and confident about myself again.The date has already been set  so the final step in this part of my journey is to raise money. The estimated cost is around $6 000. Although my insurance will cover some of the cost  most of the payment is up to me. I am a freshman in college  and most of my money is going into being able to afford an apartment and food. This is why I need your help in finally achieving something that will change my life in such a positive way.If you cannot donate  it would mean the world to me if you could share this donation with your friends and family. Any amount will help me get closer to my goal.Thank you so much for your support.UPDATE: Insurance came through  and the money donated is enough to cover the cost! I am so incredibly thankful for everyone who donated. The surgery went well  and while I'll still be recovering for quite a while  I am extraordinarily happy with this huge step in my life. Thank you so  so much for making this an achievable goal. Without your help  we would not have been able to do this. I am looking forward to seeing everything I am able to do now without fear  shame  or discomfort. This is the biggest change in my life  and I do not regret it in the slightest.

Despite working with a team of specialists at UCLA and Children's Hospital Los Angeles during these years  they ultimately referred us to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where they believed a diagnoses for Jacob's rapidly degenerating and complex condition could be found.With nearly no resources other than the support of friends  Jacob and I left for Minnesota for what was planned to be a week of intensive testing at Mayo in early December. As the first round of results came in  the Mayo researchers then kept us there for the entire month of December for additional testing. Jacob averaged four very complex tests every day including biopsies  Autonomic and Central nervous system testing  a very evasive heat test to confirm his struggle with global anhidrosis  an endoscopy  colonoscopy  multiple mri's  blood draws and so many more while leaving barely any time to relax/eat.   We spent Christmas and the New Year there in the hospital every day  and our deepest thanks goes out to the Ronald McDonald house at Mayo  without whom we would not have been able to have a place to stay after that first week of tests  even though their waiting list is extremely long.After nearly four weeks of relentless testing by over a dozen specialists and researchers at Mayo  the medical hypothesis is that Jacob may be afflicted with an extremely rare genetic disorder  in the family of diseases known as Childhood Cerebral Adrenaluekodystophy (ALD). One final series of major genetic testing needs to be performed to precisely determine the diagnoses  which involves genetic sampling and testing of both parents as well as Jacob  in order for the doctors to be certain of Jacob's condition.  That testing takes three months to complete from the time of sample  and because ordinary medical insurance will not cover such high-level and high-cost genetic testing protocols  Mayo finally sent us home with some comfort-based medications for Jacob  while we try to figure out how to start this critical genetic testing right away.Childhood Cerebral ALD is the most devastating form of ALD  it generally occurs between the ages of 4 and 10 years old. Normal  healthy boys suddenly begin to regress. At first  they may simply show minor behavioral problems  such as withdrawal or difficulty concentrating  vision problems  or start to have coordination issues. Gradually  as the disease spreads throughout the brain  their symptoms grow worse  and include blindness  deafness  seizures  loss of muscle control  and progressive dementia. This relentless downward spiral leads to a vegetative state  or in some cases proves to be fatal  usually within 2-5 years of diagnosis.  Jacob has been suffering with nearly all of these symptoms  which have been progressing over the past few years now. To say that we are devastated is an understatement.  We have not explained the hypothesis to Jacob yet  in the hope that there is a chance that the complicated genetic test we need could reveal an alternative diagnoses.  All of the \-dystrophy\"" family of conditions are without a cure.There is actually a movie about another boy who struggled with this disorder. The movie is called “Lorenzo’s Oil”.  Lorenzo's parents made it their mission in life to get their son some kind of treatment which he so desperately needed  as there is currently no treatment to halt the progress of this rare condition. Their effort yielded findings of an Oil that could possibly slow the progression down  and that Oil is now known as \""Lorenzo's Oil\"".  Sadly  Lorenzo succumbed to the disease despite their efforts.  Lorenzo's Oil remains one of the only known treatments for this disorder  but researchers are continuing to try to find more possible solutions every day.Once a person is diagnosed with this disorder  the protocol for starting the Oil  along with other medically necessary treatments to help the patient with all of the symptoms  are dependent on how far the disorder has progressed  what age it started  etc.  Unfortunately  those answers will only come with the family genetic testing that Mayo has ordered for us.I am asking everyone I know  and hope you will ask those that you know  to please send their most positive thoughts and prayers to Jacob  in the hope that he does NOT have this specific disorder  and may prove to have something more treatable. Given the prognosis of the current diagnoses  and our need to find a way to start the final genetic testing (which itself costs over $20 000)  we are doing our best to mentally  emotionally  and financially prepare for a devastating journey.  Obviously  the last several months have taken quite a toll on us in all of these ways.  It is incredibly hard.  Thank you so much to all of you who have been supportive of us through these shocks  we could not have made it this far without you.While Jacob and I were in Minnesota for the month  my husband Mike had to take medical leave to care for Jacob's younger brother Mason. Last week we were told that Mike's medical leave payments were denied because he was physically at home with Jacob's brother and not at Mayo with us.  We are still devastated at that news  and even our State Senator could not override the determination from the State EDD office.  A day later we were advised that Medi-Cal (Jacobs additional insurance) is not accepted for out-of-state medical bills. Therefore  we have suddenly inherited over fifty times the medical expenses we were anticipating  on top of the rejected medical leave income. So on top of everything else  the effort to help our son has brought us to the brink of total economic insolvency.❤️ Of course  we are completely devastated - but for Jacob  we cannot be too proud or humble to ask any entity  anywhere  for any possible urgent financial assistance  now just to be able to keep the roof over our heads.  Every day we are persistently seeking  and receiving guidance to navigate the much broader financial aspects of Jacob's situation  but today we are in a sudden hole  and are literally desperate for any help we can find.  The effort just to survive now has been physically and emotionally draining on every member of our family  and we are desperately trying to shield the children from all of this financial and medical anxiety and urgency.  And without support  Mayo can't even begin Jacob's necessary genetic testing.  It’s so difficult for us to understand why we have been put in this situation  but here we are... and as humiliating as it may be  we have no choice but to fight shamelessly to help our son in every way that we can. We are so embarrassed to reach out  but we hope that someone somewhere is able to help us continue the fight to move forward trying to help our beautiful child.  Thank you all so much for caring and asking for an update.  And thank you even more for helping in whatever way you or others you know may be able  to help our baby finally know and begin to get a firm diagnoses and treatment for what we hope will not be an abbreviated life for him ahead...❤️""",12775,30000,20,43,86,257,6

Ella Paulley&apos;s Magic Leg,https://www.gofundme.com/ella-paulley,6,NASHVILLE,TN,This is my friend Ella Paulley.  People often thought we were sisters!  She was born with a coarctation of the aorta that went undiagnosed until the age of 4.In 2016  at the age of 14 she had her second and final surgery to repair the narrowing in her aortic arch. The surgery was open heart and lasted about 10hrs. Unfortunately  due to improper positioning during the very long surgery  Ella’s peroneal nerve in her left leg was permanently damaged.  She woke up from surgery terrified because she couldn’t feel her left lower leg or foot.  She was completely unable to walk or move her foot.At first doctors were hopeful that the nerve would rejuvenate on it’s own and it did make some improvement.   However  after 2 1/2 years  she is unable to walk without the use of a walking boot.  You know this boot as the one people get when they break their foot.  Now because of the weight and height difference of the boot  Ella has suffered back/hip pain  torn ligaments and many other setbacks. She has now been told that the nerve will not rejuvenate any further and that she has rehabbed as far as she will go.Since Ella’s heart surgery (which is now great by the way :) ) she had to drop off the volleyball team  swim team  and drastically reduce her physical activities.  This has been challenging for her as well as her family.  Ella is the oldest in her family which also consists of triplet siblings. Last December my family and I took Ella to Disney World and made our way through the massive parks in a wheel chair and used trash bags to wrap her boot on water rides!  We had a great time but Ella kept apologizing for any kind of inconvenience which made me realize just how hard this new lifestyle has been for her and how much it has changed her life.Just recently on this journey she learned of a new brace that will allow her the opportunity to be more active.  The brace is actually a band that is worn just under her left knee and it provides specifically programmed electronic stimulation to the muscles.  Essentially it does the job the nerve used to do.  This will allow Ella to finally be able to wear regular shoes and walk with a regular gait.  Sounds amazing right?!!  The problem is that insurance will not cover this device at all and the quotes are $6000-$9000.  I created this go fund me account in hopes that Ella may one day be able to play volleyball again and resume more normal activities without all of the other ailments and pain she’s been dealing with for years now and I need your help to financially support her so she can get more mobility back with the brace.Please help Ella get a magic leg!,4645,9000,26,52,43,80,6
60 years  &amp; 4 generations - Our home,https://www.gofundme.com/60-years-4-generations---Our-home,7,OAKPARK,MI,Save our home from property tax foreclosure auction before July 16th 2019- these photos show generations of milestones and life events that occurred in our home over the last 45 years to include my maternal grandparents  great grandmother  father  brother  my children  and niece and nephewDear reader  Firstly  thank you in advance for your time and attention. As we value ourselves  I am well aware that we also value our time. Thus   I extend my heartfelt gratitude for merely stopping by to take a peek at my campaign to save our home from property tax foreclosure. I am humbly coming to you for assistance in this very sensitive matter.  I have until July to pay tax arrears or my daughter to auction for $1 500.00 more than my grandparents paid for it 16 years ago. A home that has been in our family  60 years and 4 generations.  I am a dedicated mother of two amazing young adults.  My son Jonah age 19 and my daughter Aria age 16.I am hard working and always endeavor to be kind and compassionate to any and everyone who I come into contact with. While the community has been generous and extremely helpful to the children & I over these last 4 yours when things have been difficult for us financially  I am here one last time trying to save our home. While I have lived here for the past decade  the home was in my mother's name and the tax arrears started after my Bubbie passed away in 2006. My mother had been residing with her for 19 years and while my Bubbie was with us  they would split the bills down the middle. My grandfather passed away in 1981 and my Bubbie was subsisting on a very small monthly VA benefit and Social Security after she was of age to collect.Likewise  my mother was having severe back and cardiovascular medical problems and was unable to work. As a result she was granted social security disability over 15 years ago.  As such  both were living on a very low social security tier.  When my Bubbie passed away in 2006 my mother tried to appeal to the city of Oak Park to modify the tax bill to make it affordable via their need based property tax modification program which did not come to fruition & the taxes passed on to the county. Fast forward to 2009 when it was no longer feasible for her to live by herself and catch up on monthly financial obligations  she decided to leave the home after an apartment became available on the Jewish Community Center campus  Prentis Apartments. These apartments are HUD subsidized which included kosher meals  activities for seniors as well as peer connection. It was at this time when my children and I moved into the home . It wasn't until November of 2010 when I started receiving foreclosure notices via process server on taped to our living room window year after year. Thereafter  I was able to set up annual appointments with the County Treasurer's Office along with my mom  wherein they advised that we could set up a payment plan because the house could not be more than 3 years in tax arrears before being be sold at the sheriff's auction in July 2010. For the next 3 years I began making monthly tax payments while the home remained in mother’s name. Due to  exorbitant penalties and interest  I was only able to pay off the 3 tax years that she and my Bubbie owed  totaling $12 500 which never allowed me to get ahead as the taxes accrued in real time.As a result of not being the homeowner of record despite being the actual occupant  I was not entitled to apply for assistance to the State of Michigan’s Step Forward program which provides assistance with property tax arrears up to $30 000. Only my mom would have been able to request the latter as the house was still legally hers and since she was confused as to how the home still belonged to her  it was increasingly confusing to her.  It was not until March of 2017 that she finally realized the latter  decided to transfer the home into my name. At that time I was unemployed and enrolled in a post bachelors degree program and we were subsisting on student loans. That same year I decided to start applying for new career positions as my son was graduating from high school and at this juncture it had been 3 years since I received child support  I was completely behind on utilities and  barely subsisting. In 2017  after much hard work I was offered a contingent job offer with a major US Airline as a flight attendant (continent on graduation from flight attendant school in Denver) wherein I graduated on August 30   2017. Just 3 days after my arrival home my son Jonah left for a GAP year to study in a yeshiva near Jerusalem. He has since completed his program  made Aliyah last July  and drafted into the Israeli Defence Forces as of the writing of this. I have successfully completed all requirement & been an Orlando based flight attendant for 19 months as of the writing of this campaign.  Words cannot express the sentimental value of our home  the fear of losing a place to live  and the only family home that exists in the world to our very small family of 7 people  which includes my 70 year young .  She moved into this house at the age of 10.Sixty years and 4 generations  anyone can surely envision how many memories  milestones and how much joy & love has been shared here. It is difficult to measure the value of how many lives were touched in one parcel of land  one piece of property that my grandparents purchased with their hard earned money  60 years ago. I imagine they themselves probably never imagined that 2 amazing great grandchildren would be raised here and that it would facilitate subsistence  fulfill dreams  and hold our family together during the most tumultuous of times  though one can assume they hoped….,530,7000,30,8,7,9,1

Gifting a New Life: Devon Cope,https://www.gofundme.com/gifting-a-new-life-devon-cope,0,KALAMAZOO,MI,My Story As I sit here typing  in my soon to be electrically depleted apartment  I ponder whether or not this will all work. I didn’t want to ever resort to this  but this is now one of the most desperate moments of my life. I’m running out of food  enthusiasm  and options  but I’m doing my best to move forward. I didn’t think this would ever happen  especially seeking help from strangers in this way. But I truly feel there's many good people out there. People that may care  and could possibly relate to my situation. If anything  please hear what I must share. My name is Devon Curcio Cope  and I am a son  and a brother. If you spend time to read this  I would sincerely appreciate it from the bottom of my soul. About three months ago  I had finally moved into my first apartment on my own  from scratch. This was a enormous life accomplishment for me  and shortly after I even managed to land a well paying job. I haven't ever felt such pride and freedom. After a month and a half of being at my job  I was let go without warning  or even a solid explanation. After that I fell into a deep depression. In all honesty  these events coupled without any support overwhelmed me to the point I froze in time. It took me weeks of wallowing in gridlock to snap out of it. I started looking for work  determined to get this right - no matter what it takes. I didn’t fully realize my position until recently  when I had a phone interview  followed by a physical interview that I failed to arrive to (due to the public transportation’s conflicting schedule). It then hit me: a car was vital to my success. Every other opportunity was squashed due to the un-accommodating bus route. I do have opportunities from places outside of my current city of Kalamazoo  Michigan   but I'm not able to get to these jobs without external transportation. I have exhausted all prospects within walking distance  and I just don’t know what else to do here. Without a vehicle to properly mobilize me  the sparse interviews I do find admittedly go untapped because of the uphill logistics involved. It’s been a nightmare to align my vital tasks and goals with the city transportation as mentioned earlier. Even getting to my old job was a struggle with the bus  which inevitably furthered tension with my job. I've also tenaciously explored every and all prospects within walking distance of me. That’s why I’m asking for your help. The fact I am running out of food and I’m struggling to pay for my own rent and utilities makes me feel terrible and awful honestly. I've begrudgingly resorted to asking my family members for help to no avail  and this hurts as they've been struggling financially also. We always have. The part that pains me the most is how I feel I should be the one helping them out as a man. I want this campaign to succeed so the road to that reality can be expedited. What will the money go towards? On top of going towards a car  the funding will go directly to my overall ability to sustain until I can get a job and start my new life. I will also post updates of my journey here  for everyone to see and experience alongside me. I feel like something good can come out of this  in fact it already has if you’ve read this far  thank you for that. Even a donation of $1 would mean the entire world to me. If that isn’t a viable option for you right now  a share on social media would magnify this campaign and bring me one step closer to correcting  and freeing my life  and potential. I appreciate everyone for taking the time to read my story - thank you. - Devon,1300,3000,18,43,6,21,6
Caring for the Campbell&apos;s,https://www.gofundme.com/the-shane-campbell-family,6,PEORIA,IL,Hi!  We are Suzie and Nancy  friends of Shane  Cara  Shae  and Jack.  We have worked with Cara for 11 years. Shane has been on full disability from DCT Industrial Supply since September 2016. He has been a loyal employee here for 25 years.  Cara (Patterson) Campbell  Shane's wife  is currently a third grade teacher at St. Vincent de Paul School in Peoria  IL.  Shae  their 17 year old daughter is a senior in high school and Jack   their 13 year old son  is in the 7th grade.    It is our hope this campaign will  help  alleviate some of their financial hardship.  In 2011 Shane was diagnosed with a rare cancer called Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma (soft tissue cancer of the abdominal cavity).  Unfortunately the only treatment for his cancer is to have the tumors surgically removed. In January 2011 he underwent his 1st surgery to remove the cancer as well as many smaller surgeries due to complications. The disease returned in late 2016. In April 2017 Shane underwent a 2nd major surgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN to remove the cancer from his abdominal and pelvis area. Due to complications of this surgery Shane was left with bi-lateral nephrostomy tubes and an ileostomy bag. In the months since his surgery  he has dealt with many infections and abdominal abscesses. Because of these infections  Shane has been  in and out of the hospital numerous times.  At his sixth month check up in September of 2018 his MRI showed the cancer has returned again and may have metastasized to other areas. Due to the complications from the last surgeries  Shane is being observed for three months to monitor the growth of the cancer.He currently undergoes monthly procedures to exchange his nephrostomy tubes. Funds raised from this campaign will provide help the Campbell family with accruing medical bills as well as daily living expenses.Thank you in advance for your support to help meet some of their needs.  Let's work together to help this young family.,9775,10000,17,98,84,338,6

Lillian Le-Quays Stroke Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/stroke-and-needs-brain-surgery,0,LORAIN,OH,On Tuesday  October 2 my dad came home from work to find my mom (Lillian) having a stroke. Although my mother was what we assume to have been mid stroke she continued to be the strong one and tried to keep the entire situation calm. My father (Albert) was quick on his feet and called 911 of course a little shocked because one ever thinks something like this would happen to them. Lily was taken to St. Johns hospital and they were unable to determine what caused the stroke. After 3 days she was transported to University Hospital Main Campus where things started to become clearer. At the UH Lily was diagnosed with a rare disease called MoyaMoya  where the two major arteries that feed the brain with blood start to close and become hard as bones. This does not allow the blood to reach her brain which is what lead her to have a stroke. We were later told that Lily would never return to her base line  but my father never gave up praying to god  the ultimate healer  every day.  So far  the brain damage that Lily has suffered seems to have had large effects to her mobility or motor skills. Despite all of these miraculous happenings of chance  we're settling in for an unexpected emergency with a recovery much longer than we anticipated. We are now on month 3 of skilled nursing’s  rehabs and back and forth to the hospital with two Major brain surgeries and during what would have been a busy holiday season at Great Spirits. Spending Lily’s favorite holidays Halloween  Thanksgiving and Christmas in a hospital bed is disappointing  but being out of work for an extended amount of time is distressing.  We still have a long road ahead of us. Unfortunately  my dad has to go back to work and insurance only covers so much... My mom will soon go home within the next month or so. My father will bear the expenses of their regular lives as well as the equipment my mother will need  renovations to their home to make it handicap accessible for my mom to live as close to a normal life. She will also need assistance at home while my father is at work. My father has also started to receive medical bills which I’m sure having reached over $50 000. We all know Lily would start arranging flowers and corsages from her hospital bed now if she could  but surviving a stroke requires a lot of diligent resting of both mind and body. A prideful problem-solver  Lily never thought she'd have to do something like fundraise for herself - but she also never thought she’d be this close to losing everything she loves. Thank you to all of our friends  and family who've reached out  and who've continued to support us. We love you guys and appreciate anything that can be donated!,5720,5000,5,114,20,320,4

Medical Student Battling Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/3tukbn-medical-student-battling-cancer,0,NORTHCHICAGO,IL,I guess you can call this my “coming out”  so to speak. To those who may feel hurt that I didn’t tell them personally – I’m sorry. But this was my diagnosis to tell  and I just wasn’t ready. To those who I did choose to confide in – thank you for lending a listening ear and for simply being present without judgment. To my parents – thank you for staying so  so strong and for showing me what unconditional love is. I am truly blessed to be your daughter. And to Alex – thank you for remaining calm and collective when I just couldn’t be. Thank you for letting me soak your shirts with tears and grieve when I needed to. And thank you for continuing to love and support me through health and sickness. I know it’s been hard  but we will get through this – I believe in us. On 9/16/18  what was supposed to be a routine exam ended in the worst way possible. The gynecologist took one look at my cervix  and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She left the room and came back with forceps  stating that she needed to perform a biopsy. Knowing that I was a medical student  she was blunt  which I actually appreciated. “You have cancer…” she said  three little words that left me paralyzed. That devastating moment  along with that entire day’s events  have replayed over and over in my head as if I’m stuck in a continual nightmare that I can’t seem to wake up from. Of course  the diagnosis wouldn’t be confirmed until the pathology results came back  but her tone and facial expression already told me everything that I needed to know. I tried to stay as calm as possible  but how do you really stay calm in this situation? After leaving her office  I got in my car and just sat in silence before eventually succumbing to my tears. How did this happen? How did THIS happen? I was only one year overdue on my pap smear  and everything had been normal before. I was not part of the “statistical” risk group. But there I was – 30 and diagnosed with cervical cancer. Two days later  the pathology report came back  confirming my diagnosis. For weeks  this was all I knew… which was almost as bad as the diagnosis itself. My thoughts had never been so irrational  and I had never thought about death so often. Of course  like every patient  I Googled. And everything I found indicated that cervical cancer is very slow-growing  specifically with a progression rate of about 10 years. Again  I was not part of the statistics. It took a week to schedule an appointment with an oncologist  and another 2 weeks to actually see her. “I’m so sorry you have to see me”  she said. And just like that  a sense of comfort came over me  and I was no longer so afraid to be vulnerable. I began to cry  and she held me. I knew she had to do another exam  and I had a feeling that it would be worse that what she assumed based on my age and lack of medical history. Our visit initially began with the discussion of a localized excision of the tumor. Then  the exam took place and again  she displayed the same concerned facial expression as the gynecologist. “It’s big ” she said  “too big to do a localized excision.” In a split second  my treatment plan had suddenly progressed to a radical hysterectomy with total pelvic lymphadenectomy  followed by radiation. I was told that she could save my ovaries  but that would mean a 5% chance of recurrence. For a while  this was the only thing I could think about. I couldn’t focus  I couldn’t study  I couldn’t exist without this taking over my mind. To give cancer a second chance or to never be able to have children of my own – a decision I still haven’t come to terms with. The PET scan came back negative. NO METASTASIS. All of a sudden  I could see a future again. I could see my life  and I was given back hope. The hardest part of this was telling my parents. It took a month. A month to gather enough information and a month to gain enough courage. To know how much pain I would cause them was at times unbearable. The day they received the phone call was the day that I felt I had failed them as a daughter. They could tell something was wrong. I couldn’t even look them in the eye  even from across the country. A month was not enough time  and I couldn’t do it. Between my oncologist  Amanda  and Alex  the news was broken to them. And I shook as I heard the pain in my mom’s voice as she called out for me and asked why this burden was not given to her instead. Some days have been particularly hard  and I find myself crying to the point of exhaustion and sleep. Other days are better  and I sometimes even find myself laughing. I am still at the very beginning of what will be a long journey  and I know I will face many challenges ahead. But throughout it all  I have discovered just how loved I am and just how many wonderful people I have by my side. I cannot do this alone  and I know that I will never have to. Please do not feel sorry for me. If not me  it would’ve been someone else. All I ask is that you do not treat me differently  for I am so much more than my illness. To the doubts and fears – I know we will meet again. To the days and nights when I am consumed with sadness – I know there are more of you to come. But to the moments of hope and happiness – I know you’re waiting for me. Life is hard. Life is busy. And sometimes  life is incredibly unfair. But life is worth living  and I am not done fighting. Fuck you cancer. [In 2 days  I will temporarily be trading in my white coat for a hospital gown.],5075,20000,32,25,74,84,6

Olivia&apos;s Eye Therapy,https://www.gofundme.com/olivia039s-eye-therapy,0,WESTBLOOMFIELD,MI,2 years ago my little girl who has always had a love for books and school started struggling to get her homework done. Instead of the normal 30 minutes or so it gradually over the course of a few months lengthened to almost 3 hours a night.  She started having horrible headaches and seemed to be getting more clumsy as time went on. She quit running around and riding her bike because she would run into things and hurt herself. She broke both her elbow and wrist in two separate instances where she couldn't see what was in front if her. Still she kept a smile on her face and kept pushing forward.  I took her to numerous eye doctors and medical specialists to find out the cause of her change in vision. Each one told me her vision was 20/20 and there was nothing medically wrong with her that would cause this. At the suggestion of the school OT I took her to a different specialist that was able to diagnose the problem. They diagnosed her with visual dyspraxia and told us that blue tinted lenses would help her brain decipher the eyes signals better. It was truly amazing what these blue lenses did for my baby girl. Although they were not covered by insurance because they didn't have a typical prescription it was the best 400$ we ever spent.  She began to be a kid again! She spent way less time on homework and spent much more time playing with friends and running again. It wasn't 100% but with the help of school and friends she was able to get by. We thought everything would be ok. Recently her eyes began to change again. Her headaches started coming back and she started losing the coordination she had gotten back with her blue glasses.  Only now the objects that would disappear from her sight were larger and her depth perception was getting worse rapidly. Unfortunately our family went through some rough times. Olivia broke her foot in two places  I broke my ankle  her Dad had emergency surgery to remove his gal bladder  I had an anaphylactic reaction to an unknown allergen and had a light fixture fall on my head in the hospital. Needless to say I didnt notice just how bad her eyes were getting. To make matters worse she tried to hide it from us because she knew we were already going through so much. By mid- summer  her blue glasses were no longer helping and she couldn't read things that were right in front of her. Armed with knowledge this time   I set about finding an eye doctor near our new house that could help her.  Three eye doctors later we finally had some answers. She only had approximately 25% sight in her left eye. And her eyes were not working together anymore. This was causing her right eye to have to work twice as hard to compensate. Her eye was physically healthy but there was a disconnect between the eye and the brain so most of the signals from the weaker eye were being ignored by the brain. They told us that more testing was needed to figure out exactly where the pathway was breaking down at. In the meantime a special pair of glasses that have multiple layers of bifocals in them would help slow down the sight loss. $600 that we had to put on our credit card and she had the glasses that she needed. The testing to evaluate her vision further also wasn't covered under insurance. Knowing that without it she could potentially lose sight in that eye completely we maxed out our credit cards to pay for it. We hoped and prayed they would find a way to save her sight. A few weeks later the results came back and we were elated. They showed us the results and were able to pinpoint the area that were causing the problem. They even showed us that some of the reflexes you are supposed to lose in early childhood around 3-5 were still present in her at 11 years old. It all made perfect sense. We had the reason why she would never go on swings   hang on monkey bars or do anything that caused her body to move from an upright position. No flips  no hanging upside down  no carnival rides  no bikes  scooters  or running in general. Her depth perception is near non existent and when she is able to get a feel for how far away things are they shift on her and go out of focus. Its overwhelming to her and makes her feel like she is constantly on a tilt a whirl. The only way to fix this is eye therapy tailored specifically to her eyes. Again the insurance company denied the coverage stating that the therapy  although widely used with fantastic results  is considered to be experimental. Without it her eyes would continue to deteriorate. Once the brain completely ignores the eye it's too late. Time was not on our side. We shifted around bills and set aside others and were able to come up with enough to start the therapy. We are nearly 4 weeks in and we are seeing her sight slowly starting to improve. Already her headaches and eye pain have started to subside. The trouble is we are already drowning in medical bills and can no longer afford her therapy without the risk of having to file bankruptcy. We have only a short time to come up with the money to pay for more sessions which must be paid for in advance.  Those of you that know me   know I would give anyone the shirt off my back if they needed it and have never asked for anything in return.  At this point I am desperate. My daughters sight is at stake and time is not on our side. I can't eat   I can't sleep  and I can't stop crying. I also have been praying that somehow we will be able to continue her therapy. Today I come to you   all my friends and family to ask for your help. We need to come up with an additional 1500 to cover the cost of her remaining sessions. And 1500 to cover the cost of the testing and sessions she already received. I know it's a lot to ask but if everyone can give even a little we can get her the therapy she needs and save her sight. Please give what you can and God Bless you all!,930,3000,19,31,15,50,6

She will talk your ear off about anything she is interested in. Any time you are talking to her she is always very insightful and you forget how young she is. Rebecca loves her brothers and is always getting into something mischievous with them  usually from her own scheming.  She brightens everyone's day and we are all truly blessed to have her and her family in our lives. Rebecca currently has a brain tumor/cyst that in the coming days will need to be biopsied. It currently looks like they will be removing it once the biopsy results are in. Rebecca has already spent over a week in the hospital for them to monitor her brain activity. All of this has come on so quickly. The day before Labor Day  Rebecca and her parents were shopping when shen she said she was thirsty in a panic. Shortly after that she had her very first seizure. They were rushed to the nearest ER when she had another large seizure. They were then moved to another hospital where she was monitored for 2 full days. Fortunately  Rebecca woke up in a hospital bed without a memory of  what happened only with her head hurting  and she was starving from not eating all day.  It has been extremely scary and difficult for everyone in their family. With all of the hospital stays and tests already and for what is left to come we would really like it if they could not worry about the financial aspect and just focus on what is important: taking care of Rebecca. Any little bit will help. We don't know how much insurance will cover and how much is really enough. Honestly any amount is significant. Please feel free to share this page.  Continue to think and pray for them. To show a hint of Rebecca's personality we have added some photos below. this was the first time she met MustardHer and her brothers laughing at their badge picture,8590,15000,13,57,127,684,6

Help Karen out!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-karen-out,8,ROCHESTER,MN,Hi Friends and hopefully friends of friends!I set up this page and account for my Sister Karen.  You see  her family needs a little help right now.  Her husband Craig recently had a pretty invasive surgery.  So far  all is going well with his recovery  thank God! The thing is  his surgery will require at least 8 weeks (may be more) off of work so she (my sis) will have to pick up the slack financially.  Unfortunately  they are not the type of family that can live off of one income and neither one of them have any type of disability insurance through work or enough paid time off to help them pay for monthly bills. These two are truly amazing people that just need a little help until he is back to work full time.  My Sister works as a PARA professional with the Byron school system helping kids with special needs and my Brother-in-law drives a bus for special needs people.  As you may know those two jobs don’t exactly pay you a lot of money. Their daughter is in college (hoping to go to grad school!) so savings is not anywhere close to large enough to cover for them.  I am asking today if you could help out  even if its just $20!  Like I said  these two spend their days helping others and don’t ever ask for help themselves! Thanks for any help you can give them  even if it is just to post to your social media pages so maybe your friends or family can help my family if they have the means.Thank you! Sharon,2965,3000,25,99,43,85,6
Wendy&#x2019;s Fight To Save Her Leg,https://www.gofundme.com/loveforwendy,0,EASTROCKAWAY,NY,Since September 23rd my mother  Wendy Leonard has been battling to save her right leg following a tragic motorcycle accident. Her dream after raising 3 boys as a single mother was to be the proud owner of her own motorcycle. She chased her dreams  took lessons  got her license and began doing what she loved with the support of her family and friends. Quickly that dream turned into a nightmare when she lost control of the bike  which crashed into the back of a van and sent her 20 ft down the road off the bike. Initially we were told they would have to amputate the leg  that injuries like this are catastrophic. We weren’t ready to quit that easy  and following a 2nd opinion we found Doctors who weren’t going to quit either. We’re blessed that she is alive  but we’re still in the early stages of a long and difficult road we must travel. Suffering compound breaks in 2 separate locations below her right knee (as well as an infection she is fighting also) she has undergone hours upon hours of surgery  skin grafting  and intense pain with the hopes that she can save the leg. Following surgeries on Oct 4th & 5th  we’re in the process of seeing how her reconstructed leg will heal up and respond. She lost a lot of bone  skin  and muscle. She has needed blood transfusions. Skin grafting has taken muscle and skin from her thigh to replace what she lost on her leg. We’re not guaranteed any of this will work  but it’s her best chance. My mom Wendy is tough. But more than that she is extremely loving and caring. She is the epitome of putting others first. I haven’t gone a day in 28 years without feeling so loved and lucky. My brothers and I just wanted her to be happy after watching her sacrifice constantly for us. We supported her decision to ride  and we are doing everything we can to support her now. She never stops thinking about taking care of everyone else. Even now she is still more worried about us than herself. Now I need help to take care of her. The medical cost are piling up and she has no way to provide for her family the way she is accustomed to. My grandfather and youngest brother still live with her  they depend on her paycheck to have a home and food on the table. Please help keep her mind focused on recovering and healing... not on hospital bills and if she’s going to have a place to live. Anything even a prayer is greatly appreciated  I just want to do anything I can to help my mom.,9852,25000,6,39,144,2000,6

The quote for the procedure  the researchers found  varied from $10 100 to $135 000 with an average cost of about $35 000.My dad is going to need financial support for his best outcome.  Please  any donations will be very helpful!!

Surgery and Rehab.,https://www.gofundme.com/surgery-and-rehab,6,ATLANTA,GA,James was hit by a drunk driver about a month ago.  The driver did not have a driver’s license nor automobile insurance. Unfortunately  James suffered bone fractures to his elbow/forearm.  In addition to this damage  the tendons and muscles in his left arm were ripped from the bone. Currently  James does not have health insurance and won’t be eligible for ObamaCare until January 2019.  Despite his lack of insurance  and the urgency of having the surgeries require to prevent the total loss of his left arm (James is left-handed)  James has moved forward with completing the first of a series of surgeries aimed at repairing his arm.  The first surgery entailed repairing the fractures to the bones which took several metal pins.  Fortunately his arm is healing well and mobility to his fingers are returning; however  he has absolutely no muscle strength and is only capable of lifting coins.  James is healing well and he is currently undergoing his 2nd surgery on October 24th which aims to repair the ripped tendons and muscles.  After the surgery is completed  James will begin rehabilitation in an attempt to strengthen his muscles. James will be out of work for almost a month while healing from the second surgery which will be followed by several more months of rehabilitation.  Due to the out-of-pocket cost of the surgery  the cost associated with the rehabilitation  and several months of unemployment during this process  we are attempting to help James raise $3 600.00 for surgery-related expenses.  We know that everyone has their own financial obligations; however  any financial assistant you could offer towards helping James save his dominant arm would be sincerely appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read James’ story.  Best wishes!,1615,3600,27,45,21,34,6

He has stabilized but we are unsure of what the coming weeks will bring. We have been alongside him and his family the whole way providing all the support and prayers.  The hope we have is knowing that Huber's Heart is the strongest part of his body.  He has given so much of himself teaching youth of God's love. He has been a member and leader at First Spanish Baptist of Lawrenceville for over 10 years. He is a true servant leader he has been a great influence here in Lawrenceville as well as his native Country El Salvador. In this difficult time it is hard to think of material things  but we must consider that even with insurance the cost of these medical bills will be a substantial burden for this family. He being the head of his household and sole provider puts even more financial stress on the situation. We are asking for support to help the Monzon family deal with the coming months of hardship. please consider helping this amazing man of God and his wonderful family.En      EspañolNuestro hermano en Cristo y amado amigo Huber Monzon  en este momento se encuentra en un estado muy critico.  Esta internado en el hospital de Emory Eastside batallando por su vida. El viernes 4 de octubre lo llevaron de emergencia al hospital  despues de una semana de varios sintomas extraños. Los doctores nos dicen que su corazon solo esta funcionado al 10% y no tiene la fuerza para distribuir las sangre al los organos del cuerpo.  Su esposa (Yanira) a estado viviendo en el hospital a su lado todo este tiempo y un familiar les esta ayudando con cuidar a su hijo.  Lo Bueno es que  despues de varios  intentos de regular la presion de la sangre  se a podido estabilizar su situation. Pero los doctores todavia no han dado un diagnostico.Como su familia hemos estado a su lado todo el camino.  Sabemos que el Corazon de Huber is muy fuerte porque el  es un hombre conforme al  Corazon de Dios. Huber ha sido un Lider y miembro de la Primera Iglesia Bautista Hispana de Lawrenceville por mas de diez años. El siendo lider de los jovenes a ayudado a muchos a conocer el amor de Dios aqui en Lawrenceville como en su pais El Salvador.En este tiempo es dificil pensar en lo material  pero tenemos que tener en cuenta que ellos estan en necesidad. Los gastos medicos sigen acumulandose  deseamos recaudar fondos para ayudar a esta familia en las proximos semanas que seran de gran dificultad. Gracias por su colaboracion a este gran hombre de Dios y su familia.,2135,10000,11,21,20,133,6

Beth of Fresh Air,https://www.gofundme.com/beth-of-fresh-air,0,BELLE,WV,"Hello  my name is April Slack. I am the mother of Beth Slack who is receiving a double lung transplant. This Go Fund Me will be to raise money for my daughter and I during her months of healing after she receives her transplant at UPMC. You never take into consideration the costs of not only living in another city for months while healing or being a care taker of someone healing  but also the costs to keep things going back at home as well. During this time  our better halves will still be working but these fundraisers will give peace of mind that things such as our mortgages  utilities  vehicles  and child care will be taken care of. If you have a moment to read Beth's story  I encourage it as she is a wonderful daughter and a loving mother with a positive outlook on everything she's faced so far and yet to come. Thank you so much and know that every little bit counts and anything donated is greatly appreciated from our family to yours.\I've lived with a chronic lung disease my entire life called Kartagener's Syndrome  which was caused by my unfortunate but unique condition of Situs Inversus. My life has consisted of challenge after challenge of keeping myself healthy and preserving my lungs as much as possible. Unfortunately  it was always known that my lung function would only decrease as well as my quality of life.Over the past few years  between natural cause and having a mind set of \""that won't happen to me\"" well it's all finally caught up to me.August of 2017  I was rushed to the hospital after my body gave up on me. Those couple weeks in the hospital literally flipped my life upside down from my job  my security  my relationships  and what my future had in store all together. Finally when I was able to go home  it was on oxygen and orders to head to UPMC to start testing for a possible lung transplant in the future.I've never fully recovered still from August of last year and even got to bring in 2018 in a hospital bed. I had to adjust to a lot of things in my life both mentally and physically. I struggle daily with even the simplest tasks that involve moving around too much due to my oxygen dropping. I don't get to be the playful mother with my children that I want to be or should be able to be by chasing them  teaching my daughter to dance  or run down a field by my son.On June 21  2018  I got the call from Pittsburgh that the next step in my health journey would indeed be a transplant and that I was approved for it  pending a couple tests.On that day  every emotion and thought went through me like a train. \""I'm only 27. I'm a mother of two toddlers. I've finally found the love of my life. This shouldn't be me. This isn't fair.\""On September 6  2018  I was about to walk out on the beach with my family when I got the call that I was officially listed for a double lung transplant and to \""be ready to go when the call comes.\""Im now finally admitting  I'm ready for this. And as odd as it may seem  posting this part of my life on social media was an extremely hard challenge for me. It's not a side that I like to share but I'm realizing that I shouldn't be ashamed to share. I've become so used to feeling sickness  chest pain  and exhaustion that I've learned to smile through it and sometimes don't even realize how sick I am until I'm knocked completely down. A lot have seen me in just the past week and I bet couldn't even tell I'm currently fighting off a case of pneumonia. Unfortunately  I'm just so used to feeling this way that I've learned too well of how to hide it.Today  after over a year of trying to hide how badly my health has declined  I'm finally lifting the weight off my shoulders and letting it out. Trying to hide the fact that I need to wear oxygen or need to slow down is taking more and more of a toll on my body and mind. I've felt ashamed to wear oxygen in public or to admit that I can't walk that far or need to stay seated or can't stay awake that long. My body works twice as hard to function and I feel every bit of that through exhaustion. Again  this surgery couldn't come soon enough.Yes  I'm only 27  but I'm going to get through this surgery and realize the best is yet to come.I'm a mother of 2 beautiful children that I fought in such a beautiful way to bring into this world (that's a whole other story!) But I'm going to get this surgery and watch my babies grow up.I just found the love of my life who I'm now officially going to marry. So for those of you asking a date...now you know why our planning may be a little off with what's going on and not knowing when the call may come. But we still have a whole life planned together and it includes growing old.This surgery will be a huge milestone for me. It's going to change my life completely. As many times as I've thought \""this isn't fair \"" I'm realizing that life is a beautiful mystery and you can't see a rainbow without a storm first. This is my storm and I'm going to dance in it.I'm thankful for all those in my life who've known already and have been there for me in so many ways. I still have a long road ahead and I'm going to need all the support I can get. My family  too  will need all the support they can get.I'm beyond thankful for the motivation and drive that so many friends and family  especially my parents  have already shown by putting together fundraisers and raising money for my healing period  during which I'll have to be living in Pittsburgh. I personally was putting it all off while still in my denial of all this but thankfully my mom has been on it full force.If you've taken the time to read this post  I thank you so much. Please know that I'm not scared  I'm ready for this  and I appreciate all the prayers and thoughts. I plan to keep everyone updated on my journey and look forward to so many of you becoming a part of it .\""Sincerely Beth""",10085,15000,9,67,111,1000,6

14yr Hand Transplant Electric Shock,https://www.gofundme.com/14yr-hand-transplant-electric-shock,9,EastYork,ON,Hello I am raising this money for my 14 years old nephew. Due to a serious electric shock incident he suffered third degree burn. This resulted in a lot of serious medical issues one of them being his right hand which needed to be amputated due to infection. We are trying to raise enough money for a hand transplant.  How did he get such a serious electric shock?First off  I would like to say that he is a very kind  caring and loving child. He is very compassionate towards stray dogs  cats and any animals. He was with one of his friends when they saw a pigeon fall on the roof and unable to move. He went to the roof with his friend to help the pigeon. While maneuvering towards the pigeon to help him he touched the wires that was connected to the main electric pole. This resulted into a blast  him being burnt and on flame. By a miracle he was saved  and rushed to the hospital that night. His mother is a single mother  divorced for the past 10 years. She works 2 jobs  teaches at school and tutors students after work at home. She does not have any support and is living over there alone and struggling to take care of her 2 kids on her own. Through all the struggles that she has faced  her son was her rock and her children are her motivation that keeps her going forward. She worked her whole life to save money so that she could send both of her children to college. Sadly  all the money that was saved was spent on her son’s treatment. He has been discharged from the hospital 2 month ago  and is currently in the healing process.About MustafaHe has undergone multiple surgeries  and has fought death like a warrior that he is. The doctor had given him 3 days when he first arrived to the hospital because his condition was very serious. Through everything that he has faced  he did not cry once and has put on a brave front for his mother. He is very grateful for the miracle and appreciative that he has been given a second chance at life.   We believe due to his kindness and pure intentions to help the bird he received this miracle.  He is a very bright young man who has been given this second chance to do greater things in life and to make a difference in the lives of others.  I am raising this money for his hand transplant. We are trying to raise enough money to get him to the US or Canada to get a hand transplant for him.  Those who are unable to please share his story and keep him and his family in your prayers. We are very thankful for everyone that is willing to help through donation and prayers.,1445,20000,29,7,20,35,6
Hips Don&apos;t Lie,https://www.gofundme.com/dc8yq-hips-don039t-lie,0,CHARLESTON,SC,"I guess you could this chapter of my life  my story  began approximately 4-5 years ago when I pulled a couple of muscles in my upper thigh moving a couple pieces of furniture on my own. The strain and the pain from that lasted unusually longer than normal  so I went to the doctor where he gave me muscle relaxers and an exercise routine to help me. After a few months the pain and limping went away and everything seemed okay again. However  it was not okay  or getting better like I thought  because the same pain proceeded to reoccur randomly on and off for several months that ended up turning into a persistent daily pain over the years. During which time I started going to my usual doctor who ran several blood  strength  breathing  and other tests to see what else was happening to me. He came to the conclusion that the polymyositis I was diagnosed with in June 2010 was in remission  so he treated me for that by increasing my weekly dosage of methotrexate  and adding prednisone  a corticosteroid  to my treatment.      For some background information  I will tell you that polymyositis is a rare  genetic disorder that affects my skeletal muscles that are involved with movement  as well as giving me a progressive muscle weakness that makes me more susceptible to catching infections. There is no cure for polymyositis  so I have my symptoms treated with the immunosuppressant drug  methotrexate and exercises. So after my treatment plan began  about 2-3 years ago  the pain and the limping was more dominant on my left side  from the leg down  than my right.     It was around July/August of 2017 when my lower body started a bit of a more aggressive  and  progressive  downward  spiral   to  the  point  that  I  was  going  to  a chiropractor every 2 weeks  getting cupping and acupuncture treatments once a week  as well as doing light exercises and stretches 5 days per week  on top of seeing my doctor once a month to every 2 months to check on my progress. Which was  unfortunately still declining and my doctor did not understand why. It was not until March/April of this year that I stopped taking prednisone  and continued only with methotrexate and a muscle relaxer. During this time also when I would meet back with my doctor he finally started realizing that my difficulty was  and still is  with walking and not my strength (which is what is common for remission with polymyositis). After more of the same tests  but this time searching for something different  my doctor sent me the email June 1  2018 telling me \The x-ray results are not good at all. You have something called \""avascular necrosis” of the hips. Unfortunately only hip replacement surgery will help.”      So researching avascular necrosis {the cover photo is an x-Ray photo of my hips and the other 3 are examples I included so you can understand and see what I am attempting to explain to you} I learned that it is a rare death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply that leads to tiny breaks  and the eventual collapse of bones in my hips. So basically  for me I have more white blood cells than red blood cells  especially in my hips  so the ball and socket joints on both my hips have diminishing tissue between the bones that is deteriorating day by day; and the only thing that will help me is hip replacement surgery. If I do not have the surgeries I will end up in a wheelchair with this same chronic pain. Approximately 45 minutes is the amount of time it takes me to get dressed in the morning. With 5 -7 minutes of that time dedicated to me strictly putting on a pair of socks. As of now  it takes me 45 minutes to an hour to walk .5 miles (the distance from my home to work) depending on the weather it does take longer; this walk use to only take me 10-15 minutes. Walking up and down the 12 steps from my living room downstairs to my bedroom and bathroom upstairs takes me 3 -5 minutes each way. I feel like the tortoise in the story of the tortoise and the hare  and how the tortoise  in its mind  thinks he’s going 100 mph when it’s actually going 1 mph.      So I do get very frustrated and depressed at times  but I try to stay positive and encourage myself in my head by counting steps  cheering myself on with a “Come on sister! You can do it!” and whatever else it takes for me to get from point A to point B and back home again. It has become a battlefield of my mind over my body when  Both  polymyositis and avascular necrosis are very rare; and I do kick myself in the butt because I should have done my own due diligence to learn that steroids and my body do not work well together. Doctors do not always know what is wrong with us and they have more knowledge in specifics  but they are also making hypothetical conclusions to our medical issues. So I would encourage all of you to research yourselves before agreeing to everything your doctors prescribe and diagnose.     It has taken me this long to talk and write about this with all of you because I do not like to burden my family and friends with my problems  I like to take care of others  as you all know. But  this time it is past time for me to swallow my pride and ask for your prayers  well wishes  hugs  and financial help to get me through this chapter of my life.      After my doctor's referral to one of the top hip replacement doctors at my hospital  he agreed to perform the surgeries on me. His plan for me is to replace my left hip first  since my right is stronger than my left  and the surgery will be 45 minutes to an hour. I will stay in the hospital for 3-4 days and begin recovery at home. He said I would feel the difference within the first week or so. Then 2 weeks later he will perform the surgery on my right hip  so in 2 months time all the limping and pain will be very minimal and I should not need a cane anymore.      When the billing department contacted me they told me the cost of the surgery is $122 492 per hip  which does not include physical therapy  medications  or any after care services if necessary. After funding and financial assistant from the hospital  I now owe approximately $61 246.35 per hip  $122 492 total after both surgeries are completed. They will not operate on me until they receive the full cost of one hip replacement surgery  and after that I will still have to put down something for the second surgery (she said at least half)  and then I could have a monthly payment plan.     So now I am asking my family and friends  which is pretty much one in the same  to pray for me  hug me when you see me  and help me if you can get these surgeries done sooner than later please. I would love to start the next chapter of my life  and get back on track to go to Japan  and watch Sade continue to grow and graduate. I plan on selling my clothes  shoes  etc. that I’m purging from my closet as part of a fundraiser at Local 616 to raise some money for my surgeries as well; I’ll let you know the day. Thank you for taking the time to read about me  and your thoughts and prayers. I love you all.Word.Vicki Mitchell""",5195,25000,18,21,70,254,5
Breana keep on Dancing,https://www.gofundme.com/breana-keep-on-dancing,6,SPARTA,NJ,Hello all!\nAs some of you might already know  we are raising money for our 11 year old daughters surgery and are here to share our story with you.\nFirst let me tell you a little bit about Breana. She is a bright  energetic girl who loves hanging out with her friends and talking on the phone. Her passion is dancing and wants to become a nurse when she grows up. She has been dancing since the age of 3 and starting competing at age 6. Breana was diagnosed with Scoliosis last November with a curve of 36 degrees. This required her to wear a brace for 16 hours a day. This summer Breana started to complain of back pain and at her follow up appointment we discovered that the brace did not work and her curve has increased to 58 degrees. She was then sent for MRI’s in hope that there was a benign tumor pushing on her spine. MRI results came in and we were told she needs to see an Orthopedic Surgeon for Scoliosis Surgery. After multiple opinions our only option was metal rods and screws. Our hearts dropped! We began researching anything and everything we could on scoliosis and found a new less invasive surgery called Anterior Scoliosis Correction (ASC). There are hundreds of success stories. The only issue is that since this has not yet been FDA approved  insurance will not pay and the surgery is $50 000 with $30 000 up front.\nThis money will be used entirely for Breana’s surgery and if the goal is exceeded please know this money will be paid forward to help another child in need.\nIf you could support my GoFundMe by making a donation and then sharing it with your network  I would greatly appreciate it. I know that money can be tight  so please know that even $5 helps me get closer to my goal! Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll be happy to answer them.,10220,50000,16,20,105,440,6
Fight for the Veneros!,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-for-the-veneros,7,NEWHYDEPARK,NY,In Calca  Peru  my grandfather Demetrio Venero is facing many health issues at 75 years old. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis  cardiomegaly  blown varicose veins  and peripheral venous disease.He requires many medical supplies that he does not have access to in his vicinity. In his small town in Peru  his children and grandchildren are doing their best to take care of him. However  money has always been a big problem  with salaries barely covering the cost of living . In Peru  a full-time experienced teacher has a weekly salary of $250 USD. A registered nurse in Peru has a salary of $300 USD per week. Although his family tries to save enough to provide for his care  the money they earn is simply not enough. There are few hospitals in his small town and even fewer outside resources. Due to his pulmonary fibrosis  my grandfather cannot breathe well and needs supplemental oxygen to survive. After much research and struggle  his family has looked into purchasing an oxygen concentrator to help my grandfather breathe. With each oxygen tank costing $150 USD  an oxygen concentrator would be very useful and efficient  but comes with a costly price.  Portable oxygen concentrators can go from $2000 USD to $3000 USD. However  this item would greatly improve my grandfather's quality of life and would allow him to perform his daily activities with much more ease and comfort. This item would allow him to spend a better life with his beloved family  without the bulk of heavy oxygen tanks needed wherever he goes. Along with his breathing problems  my grandfather also has major circulatory issues. His peripheral venous disease has become the most problematic in the legs. This has led to several venous ulcers  which are very hard to heal since no blood is circulating through to promote skin regrowth. His daughter  a nurse in Peru  has been very helpful in keeping his wounds free of infection  however  all her medical supply costs have accumulated over time.We are asking for help from all of our friends  family  community  and friendly strangers alike! Every little bit counts and is much appreciated! All proceeds will go towards my grandfather's care and health. His family would like to thank you all for your love and support!!!,570,5000,18,11,11,40,6
Medical Expenses for Stan Lamar,https://www.gofundme.com/medical-expenses-for-stan-lamar,8,CALERA,OK,First and foremost we thank you God for our family and friends and lift up Stan Lamar And his family in prayer and love. Stan suffered a heart attack weeks ago and still tried to work. Anyone who knows Stan and Becky know how hard they work. On top of his heart attack he has Congestive Heart Failure. They did a heart catheter after a couple days in the hospital expecting to do a few stents. What they found was much worse and unfortunately his heart wasn’t strong enough to survive the surgery he needed. For a week now  they have worked on his heart to build up the strength needed for his quadruple bypass surgery on Wednesday  October 9th. This has shook the family to the core and they need help. Stan and Becky are the hardest workers I know and never ask for a handout! They live paycheck to paycheck  like we all do. On top of that  Stan’s insurance went out 2 weeks before the incident. Becky hasn’t left his side for a minute. She’s slept in that uncomfortable chair in his room this whole time. Their love for one another is how they have gotten through this. Stan is looking at about a 4-6 month recovery and which means he will be out of work and due to the type of work they both do  they don’t accrue any annual or sick leave. I’m asking for everyone to come together to help a family that has always gone out of their way to help people.This family has done so much for so many people. They have taken so many kids in that needed it without asking for anything in return. We want to help them in any way possible. This money will help the lost wages and keep utility bills on. We also would like to make a dinner list where anyone interested can sign up to take them dinner that way Becky has one less worry. I can’t say enough good things about this family. They are the most deserving people I know. Please find it in your heart to give anything you can along with lots of prayers! Thank you all so much!!,1840,5000,5,37,20,353,6

My Moms Fight to beat this!,https://www.gofundme.com/xuq3zk-medical-expenses,1,VIRGINIABEACH,VA,I never in a million years thought I’d have to hear news like I did on September 27th. My mom  received news that shook our whole world. She was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer called leiomyosarcoma. Although she went through surgery on September 12th to have the tumor removed  we unfortunately received news today that another tumor has started growing. They told us this form of cancer was aggressive but we had no idea just how aggressive it would actually be. Hearing your mom tell you that the doctors says her prognosis isn’t good  we are going to fight like hell. My mom is one of the strongest people I know and I believe that we have a chance to fight and beat this. We have to believe that she can make it through this. With the hospital stays  numerous trips to the ER and chemo treatments my mom needs all the support anyone is willing to give. With not being able to work and supporting her kids on her own it’s been really hard just to keep her head abover water. We are so grateful for your support and appreciate it more than you could even know.,4345,5000,5,87,40,720,6
Matt&apos;s Medical Recovery,https://www.gofundme.com/MattStroke18,0,COLUMBUS,GA,"After having a stroke and a gangrene in my foot  things have went bad even moreso now that i cant work at all and Rachel is having to care for me  as some of you are aware I've been plagued with several Medical issues these last 2 yrs. Along with Diabetes   its also Fibro  OA  Neuropathy   a Toe Amputation and recent near miss with Cancer  but thanks to Dr. Smith at John B. Amos we beat it!  Then Oct. 14th i was admitted to Peidmont Northside for an infection to my left foot caused by stepping on a nail  treated for and released on Oct. 20th The first of November id been feeling \off\"" and weak and felt something was off. Then on Nov. 9th my wife Rachel while changing my bandage for the wound on my left foot noticed some color change   i explained i was real weak and would have it checked out and so i took a 2 hour nap on the Sofa. Little did i know that 2 hour nap would be the worse 2 hours of my life  because when i woke up... i had no feeling from the waste down.  EMS was called and later at Piedmont North i was admitted to the ICU  during my 2 hour nap i had suffered a Stroke.  Odly enough that very stroke along with my Wife recognizing the signs may be what saved my life  because my foot injury had also cause me to become Septic.  Meaning my own blood was poisoning me. I was then transferred to Midtown Medical and was suggested that \""I call in the Family\""   because it wasn't sure what damage was done or if my blood could be fixed soon enough. I was on a 12 hour window  my kidneys had stopped  i was on a heart monitor and oxygen . I refused to call the Family in because to me  that would be giving up and saying bye and i wasn't   i couldn't give up like that. The next day through many prayers and the good lord and my doctors things started looking up  by the next day i was off oxygen  and kidneys working at 100% function. The Stroke didn't cause any brain damage  but did cause some minor damage to my ability to write. .. its a little sloppy now  and i can not stand on my own nor walk on my own  i can't bathe on my own yet. I have to be sitting or have someone with me  meaning i cant do what i love and cook. The Doctors wanted me to move into a Rehabilitation facility for 6 mos  or go daily for a minimum of 12 months for Rehab and Therapy  however my insurance will Not cover any of it. So ill be going home soon where Rachel with some help from Home Health Care will help me. Surgery was also done to my left foot and was basically gutted and packed and for a while i can not bare weight on it. Plus other surgeries are in line. My doctors want me in a Wheelchair a majority of the time plus i need to attempt to get a Wheelchair van  along with adding rails to the apartment inside and everything else that comes along with the life altering events. Plus i have to continue Antibiotics for several months at home through a Central IV Picc Line that insurance only covers part of. I simply ask for your prayers  to share this post and if and only if you're able to help out my family and you fell touched to do so  please do . And y'all know as soon as i can ill be back out there doing my part and helping the community again. I hate asking for anything that benifits me and i think y'all know that  although i love to help others... i have for the first time had to realize that im dowm  this ole dog is down and for once need a little help to get back up.

Aplastic Anemia. After trying medication  B-12 shots and a blood transfusion to no avail she had her first Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. This also did not work. Her body was still not producing red blood cells.  She has since moved to Richmond Virginia and is  being treated by the Oncology team at MCV Hospital. Two weeks ago they started her on an aggressive chemotherapy treatment (11 sessions) to kill all bad blood cells and condition her bone marrow for another transplant. Friday they did her second Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.  They are confident she had a  good donor match and are hoping to see new blood cells in  as early as two weeks but in all likelihood it will take 6 - 8 weeks.  Alexis is very strong and very positive but this disease has taken its toll. She is tired to the point of exhaustion  has lost a lot of weight and most recently was in the hospital with a kidney infection as her immune system is weakened. She continues to work as much as she physically can but her bills are adding up. Any help and support you can give her would be greatly appreciated. We ask that you keep her in your prayers as these next 8 weeks of waiting will be stressful. If you are interested in becoming a blood stem cell donor go to Be The Match,3430,10000,12,34,43,254,6
Please help Sofia!!!,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-sofia,9,MIAMI,FL,My name is Tatsiana. I met this precious girl 9 years ago and I was Sofia’s therapist for many years. Since that time  Sofia  has a special place in my heart! Sofia Mabrouki is a  beautiful 10 year old girl who suffers from hyporplastic left heart syndrome and aortic stenosis. She already underwent for more than 10 very complicated heart surgeries and had one done today at the Miami Children’s Hospital. She also suffered a stroke after the major surgery she had in November 2012. If you meet this beautiful girl  you would never think that there is something wrong with her.  However  due to her medical conditions and a very weak immune system  Sofia gets tired very quickly and gets very sick often. She misses a lot of school and can’t perform a lot of activities of daily life that other girls of her age can do on a regular basis. Her recovery from today’s surgery hopefully will be successful. Sofia comes from the family of immigrants who is working really hard to provide for the kids. She has an older 12 year old brother. Since her mom has to stay in the hospital with    her   and her dad has to work night shifts to provide for the family and take care of her older brother  they are missing out on some extra income that can help them have their basic needs met and accommodate Sofia’s recovery to be successful and stress free! This additional income can also help Sofia’s family  pay for her tutoring since she is missing a lot of school time. Any contributions to Sofia’s account can help !!!! All the contributions will be given to Sofia’s family in the form of the check to help her parents to pay for basic necessities such as rent  electricity  basic bills. And to get Sofia necessary help to be able to successfully return to school upon her recovery. Thanks for your help!!!Tatsiana Osko MS.CCC.SLPTatsiana Osko Inc/Therapy for children,12098,12500,26,97,131,246,6
Bishop Stephen A. Thomas,https://www.gofundme.com/bishop-stephen-a-thomas,9,DALTON,GA,Bishop Stephen Thomas and his lovely wife  Dana Thomas was spending time in Atlanta celebrating their 34 year Anniversary on July 6th.  The next day they were on their way back to Dalton Ga. traveling with very congested traffic on I-75 N in Marietta Ga. Their vehicle came to a complete stop. Unbeknown to them  there was another vehicle behind them that didn't see the traffic stopping.  When he looked up  he slammed on his breaks to try to stop and plowed into the back of Bishop Thomas' vehicle pushing them into the vehicle that was in front of them.  The impact initially rendered Stephen unconscious and when he awakened  he was paralyzed from his shoulders down. He was transferred to the Regional Trauma Center at Kennestone Hospital where he was diagnosed with severe spinal cord trauma at levels C2-C4. He was in the hospital for 10 days with 7 of those days being in ICU.  He was then transferred to Shepherd Center where he received intensive rehabilitation for about 5hrs per day.  During his stay at Shepherd  he underwent several surgical procedures at the adjoining Piedmont Hospital which included a tracheotomy.  He was finally sent home on September 18th still with complete paralysis from the shoulders down confined to a specialized wheelchair that is operated by using his mouth.  He continues to receive home health care which includes physical and occupational therapies as well as skilled nursing care.As you can imagine  the medical expenses are astronomical. Fortunately he has medical insurance  however the uncovered portions for his care are still outstanding and continuing to accrue. The person that hit them did not have adequate insurance to cover medical expenses  loss of vehicle nor loss of income.From July 7th until this present moment  his wife has not left his side and she has been the primary care giver learning everything necessary to take care of him.  Unfortunately  she has to return to work on Oct. 24th in order to maintain the medical insurance.  At that point  he will need someone to step in and sit with him while his wife is at work.We are asking for your donations to help cover the continuing medical expenses.  He is in need of a modified vehicle that he can roll in to and lock down while being transported to and from doctor's appointments and church.,10266,25000,8,41,56,594,6

Help Nadja during this time of loss,https://www.gofundme.com/help-nadja-during-this-time-of-loss,8,WESTFARGO,ND,We are asking for your generosity during this time of immense grief for our dear friend Nadja. This summer she lost her father in a tragic plane crash in Africa. Due to an investigation of the crash the family was forced to wait over a month to receive his body back in Germany. In the meantime some of Nadja’s friends set up a GoFundMe for her to help with the travel expenses to Germany. It was a huge success and she and her son Anthony were able to travel to attend the funeral without having to stress about money. However  only three weeks after returning from her father's funeral she received the unthinkable news - that her mother had also passed away. I’m sure one can only imagine the level of devastation unless it has been personally experienced. Nadja did not wish to have another GoFundMe because she said she felt bad because people had already given so much…But  we love her and we know that the cost of traveling half way across the world is great. We know that having to deal with the stress of financing travel while navigating through such grief is an unnecessary burden she should not have to bear.  We would like to accept donations to help her with these travel expenses. Please consider donating. Any amount large or small is helpful and no act of compassion is ever wasted. Thank you!,2795,2500,31,112,43,53,6

I am collecting funds to help with my recovery after surviving being shot in the head.On March 15  2017 my landlord and a handyman she had hired got into a business dispute in my front yard. The handyman pulled out a gun and shot my landlord and her boyfriend  in the head  killing them instantly.  The shooter then came after me shooting me twice  once in my right upper arm and once through the right side of my head. The shooter fled the scene and ultimately ended his own life as well.I am the only survivor of this horrific and devastating day.  I have had two surgeries on my head  one for the initial trauma surgery and the second was for the reconstruction of my skull. The damage to my brain caused me to be be temporarily paralyzed on the entire left half of my body and also left me half blind in both eyes.  During my recovery over the last year and a half I have relearned how to eat  drink  walk and every other basic/essential life skill. I am still enrolled in an outpatient neuro rehabilitation program for brain injuries to regain control of movement in my arm and leg and also regain vision in my eyes. I have come very far and plan to continue to fight for my recovery! Any funds received from this campaign will help me pay for life changing  treatments and therapies i cannot afford on my own and  pay remaining debts and bills I still have.My long term goals are to open a disability equipment company and a non profit charity to help other people with disabilities accomplish something they have always dreamed of doing but feel like they cant achieve because their disability is holding them back.   please help me recover so i can eventually accomplish my dreams of helping others living with disabilities.

Rusty &amp; Helen Family Emergency,https://www.gofundme.com/rusty-amp-helen-family-emergency,9,FAIRBANKS,AK,FAMILY EMERGENCYPlease consider assisting my nephew Russell and his wife Helen. Last week they flew to San Diego  California from Anchorage  Alaska with their three year old daughter for a weekend wedding. Helen  who is six months pregnant with twin boys  was cleared by her doctor in Anchorage to make the trip. Unfortunately  following the wedding  complications arose and she is now in a hospital in San Diego and cannot leave the hospital until the babies are born  and most likely longer if the twins are born prematurely and need to stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  Helen must remain on bed rest and doctors are hoping that she won’t deliver for another a month or longer so the boys can fully develop. On top of this  my nephew will need to fly between California and Alaska at least twice to take care of matters while Helen is in the hospital. As you can imagine  all this is leaving them strapped financially - and being away from home  work and family is very stressful on all of them. Please consider donating any amount you can to help them during this difficult time.  If anything  please keep this young family in your prayers.,2675,10000,11,27,36,266,6
More Birthdays for ADLE,https://www.gofundme.com/more-birthdays-for-adle,9,DICKSONCITY,PA,In behalf of my family in the Philippines  I am asking for Prayers and a little help for my Godchild and great niece who is a 7yr old girl named ¨Jhay Adlehyde Pueyo¨.  Her grandmother and parents noticed something unusual before her birthday on August 7. There seemed to be a lot of bruises all over her body.  So just after celebrating her birthday they brought her to nearest hospital only to find the results of her blood test was unexpectedly bad.  The doctors immediate told them that she will need more testing because there were signs of defects and abnormalities.  They soon transferred Adle to Philippine Childrenś Medical Center.  A second blood test was administered and the results showed that her platelet count was unimaginably low.  The Doctor immediately requested for a blood transfusion and a bone marrow biopsy which left our family in shock.  Our little Adle has aplastic anemia also called bone marrow aplasia  a rare but serious condition which causes the body to stop producing enough new blood.  Without new red blood or white blood cells and platelets the immune system is severely weakened.  Effects may occur suddenly or it can occur slowly and it gets worse over time.The reason that I am asking help is because the treatment may include daily medication  multiple blood transfusions  constant testing  and hospital bills.  Adleś Dad is a hard working man overseas and heś providing for his wife and three children including Adle.  The timing of this unfortunate event left him on a tough journey in life because of being away from the family.  It would be a great help if we can all come together to support them financially and Prayers.The Doctor has suggested a new type of treatment but the chance of it being successful is only 60 percent.  Because of the possible side effects Adle´s body might react unpredictably.With your prayers and a little donation  it would help our family tremendously in this rough time.  Our ultimate goal is to avoid the bone marrow transplant if possible.  Right now she is in and out of the hospital for blood transfusions and complications.  Our family in the Philippines needs as much help possible and I know we can rally together and come through for them.Please send prayers of healing for her.  Thank you for your time. We appreciate all those who can donate and those who have her in your prayers.  May the LORD GOD give back to you all a hundred fold of blessings.,2380,10000,4,24,39,1000,6

John was involved in a 4-wheeler accident. At first he felt ok but soon thereafter  he started to talk incoherently. Stacey  a GCEMS paramedic was working and didn’t know what happened.  John’s friends called an ambulance after finding him injured. Stokes County EMS rushed him to Baptist. Stacey met them there.   After several tests  it was determined that John had a brain bleed  a fractured skull  and a broken neck. He remained hospitalized for two days. The doctors likened his injuries to Shaken Baby Syndrome. John is home and starting his long anticipated recovery. Due to the type of injuries he has  Stacey will need to take care of him around the clock.  That means  Stacey  won’t be able to work. And as John recovers  he won’t be working either. Let’s take care of this paramedic and her family! She helps members of our community through the worst days of their lives.

Kathi&#x2019;s Angels,https://www.gofundme.com/68m2u00,5,Margate,FL,There is a pair of very dear friends of mine.  They are Kathi and Debbie Drohan.  They are both very kind hearted individuals who will do anything for anyone and even give the shirts off their backs if that was needed.  As of late Kathi has had a horrible string of bad luck.  First she breaks her hand at work and her employer chose not to carry workers comp insurance so she has been having to pay for doctors appointments out of pocket.  Then her company downsizes and eliminates her position leaving her without a job. To top it off they had a accident around the house where she fractured her shoulder.  She has attempted to secure unemployment benefits but since she is injured in her primary side with both injuries she can not work at this time.  She needs help with meds  doctors appointments and physical therapy that will be needed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I am assisting the Dorhan’s with this as they are unsure how to set it up.  All monies will he sent directly to them.  Please take a few moments to donate if you can.,275,1000,15,28,9,42,6

He has been a great friend and ‘older brother’ through the years and he now needs our help. Joel is a 25 year old talented artist and a very hard worker who has had a series of tragedies in his life over the past couple years including the deaths of two of his closest friends  his entire support system being stripped away  his vehicle being totaled and suffering from serious depression.

Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/wuj7e7-medical-bills,5,DAVENPORT,IA,On the morning of Sunday October 7th my fiancé Cayne was involved in a single car accident. He lost control of his vehicle due to the road being slippery from the rain that had been occurring all night and morning. He ended up with a totaled car and a broken hip and had to undergo hip surgery the morning of October 9th. Cayne will be out of work due to this accident for at least 2 months long. Cayne is the sole provider for our family of four. I do not work due to being in college and raising our kids. With that being said  we will not have a stable income for quite some time and have multiple medical bills to pay  on top of groceries  household supplies  belongings for the children  reoccurring monthly bills  etc. We will also be one car short and will eventually need to find a new car. We are very thankful that this accident was not any worse than it was  but we are still in a tough situation and need of some help. Any amount of money that could be donated to us would be beyond helpful and beyond appreciated. Anything will help. Thank you so much.,900,1000,10,90,17,132,6
Join Rowan&apos;s Fight,https://www.gofundme.com/join-rowan039s-fight,0,Barrie,ON,It is with a heavy heart that I announce that on September 8th  2018  Rowan Wiita  just shy of his 2nd birthday  was diagnosed with T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma  a rare and aggressive form of cancer.Rowan is the first and only child of Melissa Kennedy and Ryan Wiita.  Rowan was always one of those babies that had a little grin that made everyone smile  always exploring  challenging boundaries and keeping a close eye on his mommy and daddy whom he loves so much.    He loves playing in the backyard  goofing around with mommy and daddy  reading books  learning about the world  attempting to befriend his cats and hanging out with his toddler buddies.  A typical toddler with extraordinary parents who would move heaven and earth for their child. The nightmare began in early September when Rowan’s parents noticed a large swollen lump in Rowan’s neck.  They immediately brought him in to the hospital and were told it was a common swollen lymph node likely caused by a virus and was treated as such but if it didn’t go away to bring him back.  The swelling didn’t go away  and Rowan began having difficulties breathing and was brought back to Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital where several tests were immediately ordered. I have been described the scene and it still haunts me.  I can’t imagine the terror and helplessness you would feel watching your child  your little guy  your baby turning blue struggling to breath surrounded by a swarm of Doctors trying to save his life.  That day they did.  Mel and Ryan were told that it was likely cancer and that there was a tumour in his chest pushing against his airway and heart making it hard for him to breath.  They were immediately rushed by ambulance to SickKids Toronto ICU.  The short ride there I image felt like crossing the country.  The message I received from Mel describes it best “We have every specialist.  Every one.  There can’t possibly be any more elsewhere in Canada because they are all here.  Cancer confirmed.  My baby.”  I can’t imagine the mix of emotions of comfort and fear of knowing that so many doctors are there just for your son.The next day a successful biopsy was performed on his lymph node by some of the best Doctors in the country who described the procedure as “extremely dangerous”.  It was then that Rowan’s parents learned of his specific type of cancer  T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma or T-ALL  and that he will require heavy chemotherapy treatment for likely years to come.  Their lives have changed forever.  Rowan  like other chemo patients  will sometimes not be able to attend playgroups  festivals  crowded playgrounds or even grocery stores like other toddlers when treatment causes an additional risk of him catching a virus that with his compromised immune system could potentially be deadly.  He will spend his 2nd birthday at the Ronald McDonald house.I have known Ryan and Melissa for many years and have always been grateful for their friendship.  They are the most humble  selfless and giving individuals I have ever known.  Ryan is a skilled carpenter who has created some of the most stunning pieces of furniture I have ever seen.  Mel is a talented goldsmith who has always had a passion for creating.  Both would agree Rowan is their greatest creation.  They are very private people and I have never known of them asking for help.  In one of the first conversations I had with Mel after Rowan’s diagnosis her and Ryan spoke of winning the lottery so that she could give everything they could to SickKids and Ronald McDonald House  they are truly selfless human beings that need our help.With a child’s cancer diagnosis inevitably comes increased expenses and reduced income. Ryan has been off work since the original trip to the hospital and won’t return until Rowan is past these critical stages and frequent  sometimes daily  hospital treatments that leave Rowan ill and the family taxed. It is unlikely Mel will be able to return to work for years after originally planned as Rowan will most likely not be able to attend daycare/preschool in the years to come with the immune system issues and the amount of time needed for continued  frequent appointments and treatments.  They are currently living by his side at SickKids and Ronald McDonald house out of suitcases filled with mostly home comforts for Rowan.  They have worked hard  saved for years and bought their own house Ryan was fixing up when not travelling for work.  They have car payments  mortgage payments  insurance and hydro bills added to the cost of travel to and from Toronto for years to come for Rowan’s continued treatment with only Ryan’s EI payments currently coming in.  Which brings us to today.  Everyone knew that Rowan was a tough kid but nobody knew he was a warrior!  With every test performed  biopsy  tube inserted  needle injected  with every x-ray  CT scan and dose of chemotherapy treatment  Rowan has gotten back up and continued to be  well… Rowan.  He has continued to play hide and seek  play with his toys and giggle with mommy and daddy because he knows they need those moments of love as much as he does.  He has taken everything cancer has thrown at him and fought back.  Rowan has been in far too many battles in his short life and now he needs our help  his own army to win this fight!  I am asking anyone that can donate to help Rowan and his parents take on this monster they call cancer with mind unfettered with paying bills.Be a part Rowan’s fight to show Rowan  Mel and Ryan how many people care  how many people stand behind them and how they are not alone!,13730,30000,16,46,168,729,6
Service dog for Marleigh,https://www.gofundme.com/service-dog-for-marleigh,7,FORTWORTH,TX,3 years ago I was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. This condition  along with six other chronic co-morbid conditions  affect my joints  heart  blood pressure  vision  hearing  and digestion among other things. Further testing found gastrointestinal emptying issues  two heart defects  and autonomic testing revealed a completely fault autonomic nervous system. On a daily basis I struggle with balance  maintaining a safe heart rate  bending down to get things  getting medication during an episode  standing and walking for extended periods of time  and more.There is no cure for my conditions and precious little in the way of treatment. Currently medically I can't be helped. EDS is progressive and my level of functioning will continue to get worse as I age. As the years have passed I have found it increasingly difficult to work and will be pursuing some sort of work from home position in the future as a result.The one thing I've found that has made daily life better and has enabled me to get out of the house as well as attend work is the help of my service dog. Batman currently assists with picking up dropped objects  helping me walk using momentum pulling and counterbalance  staying with me during medical episodes  giving me something to hold onto during dizzy spells that strike out of nowhere  and most importantly giving me alerts when my heart rate is too high or too low so I can act accordingly. He alerts before I'm able to feel the trend so I can treat the issue before it makes me really sick.However  Batman is coming up on retirement and I currently have a Standard Poodle named Kintsugi in training to be his replacement. I'm working with an amazing program but training still isn't cheap. His total training cost will be around $8 000 and he cannot graduate the program until that amount is paid  as well as any vet bills  food bills  or anything else that comes up for him. My income is very limited due to the type of work I'm able to do and having to work reduced hours because of my conditions. I need help to bring him home. My service dogs have changed my life and giving me back an independence I can't accomplish without them. I can go to the store by myself again. I can make it through a work day. I can walk for longer periods without my heart getting strained or fear of falling. Having Sugi will guarantee my independence continues  as well as providing me a friend and partner to see me through the rough days. Every little bit helps  please help me bring my hero home.,162,5000,18,3,7,29,6

Help Aurora Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/help-aurora-fight-cancer,1,BERKELEY,CA,Help Aurora Fight CancerHello everyone. I am being treated for Stage 3 ovarian cancer and am asking for your help as my family and I are having difficulties making ends meet. BackgroundIn late February  I was in and out of several emergency rooms before I was diagnosed with Stage 1 ovarian cancer. In March  I had major surgery to remove a cancerous ovarian cyst. However  an analysis of removed tissues revealed that the cancer had metastasized into my lymphatic system and could spread to any part of my body. I now had Stage 3 ovarian cancer and needed chemotherapy to eradicate  cancerous cells.My oncologist told me not to work  during this time as the chemotherapy treatments would seriously compromise my immune system. Since I work with kids  I would be at great risk for exposure to any illness going around. I have applied for various public assistance programs and grants for cancer patients but have been denied for all of them. I found out that the school district I work for does not set aside disability funds for substitute teachers. I was also ineligible for disability through SSI as I have not been disabled for a year or more. I was also an unpaid caregiver for my Father who was suffering from Alzheimer’s. We were taking many of the same meds and had to do the same physical therapy exercises. I helped to prepare meals  went on walks and kept him company. His passing in late June not only broke our hearts but also took away a large part of my family’s financial support system. What the funds raised  will be used forI unfortunately have not been able to work since February 26 of this year. I had several hospitalizations and major medical procedures since then. When my chemo treatments are over  I will not be able to work until January 2019. I am asking for $24 000 to cover numerous expenses. Since I cannot work until January of next year  I need financial assistance to help with my continued cancer care and after care. Funds raised will go towards basic living expenses such as rent and utilities  health insurance premiums  organic food  medical expenses not covered by my insurance  pain management costs (acupuncture treatments   etc..)  and complementary medicinal supplements (herbs  tinctures  lotions and sprays).As a result  of all the above  I have to ask for financial assistance from my community of family  friends  and acquaintances. Any donation is deeply appreciated. And prayers  positive words and thoughts are always welcome. Thanks to you all!Love and Peace  Aurora,3485,5000,11,70,30,214,6
Stand by Amy,https://www.gofundme.com/frwd72-stand-by-amy,6,ATTLEBORO,MA,Amy Pelletier is one of the kindest people I know. She is always worrying about others and wanting to help them. Over the past few years Amy has been having pain originating from her back. At first  it just showed up in her shoulder and neck  and later she began having problems with her legs. This past month has been a real struggle for Amy and her family. After further evaluation  she began physical therapy and was rushed by ambulance to Brigham and Women's hospital for emergency spinal surgery. Due to surgical complications  she had to undergo a second spinal surgery just two days later. Amy has been so sweet throughout it all. As many know. Amy never wants to be an inconvenience or burden to anyone. She has since had an additional surgery  totaling three spinal surgeries in just two weeks with a couple more in the near future. As many know   medical costs add up quickly  and with Amy out of work  her two kids in college  medical bills have grown to the point of being overwhelming. We ask that you take a minute and consider donating to this cause to help the Pelletier family. Every little bit helps  and is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!,5310,10000,10,53,40,304,6

Flood Help for Monica &amp; Alberto,https://www.gofundme.com/flood-help-for-monica-amp-alberto,2,NUTLEY,NJ,Monica and Alberto suffered a major flood loss on August 11th at their Nutley  New Jersey home due to sudden run-off from heavy rainstorms that wreaked havoc in the northern part of the state.  Over five feet of water in their basement destroyed everything. About two and half feet in their backyard damaged many items in the garage and shed  as well.  Unfortunately  after providing initial clean-up services  their homeowners insurance carrier has denied their claim. Because their home had no flood history and is not located in a flood zone  they did not have separate flood coverage. Monica and Alberto are now faced with huge unexpected repair and replacement costs at a time when their expenses are already high due to Alberto’s recent shoulder surgery  tuition for Monica’s PA program  and upcoming college costs for their son Gabriel.  Some of their major expenses from the flood include:§  hot water heater - $1000§  boiler - $1800 repair / $5500 to replace if not repairable§  washer & dryer - $1000§  insulation and sheetrock - $6000§  electrical – $3000§  shower & fixtures - $1500§  painting - $1000§  flooring - $3600§  exterior wall construction - $2000 (to close-off the basement’s rear entrance to prevent future flooding)This list is far from exhaustive and is already approaching $20K  not even including the furniture and other fixtures that were destroyed. Together we can raise the funds to help them out at this difficult time.  They have always been the type of people to lend an immediate hand to those who needed it. Now they are the ones that need some help. Please join me in contributing what you can.  All donations are greatly appreciated and will be gratefully acknowledged.  In a year  perhaps we can all gather to celebrate the renovation  our part in it  and the importance of family and friends in our lives.Thank you all.Warmly Linda Baum,1570,18000,40,9,14,7,6

Ry &#x201C;warrior princess&#x201D; Bradley,https://www.gofundme.com/ry-warrior-princess-bradley,7,VIRGINIABEACH,VA,At the end of September Ryleigh  and her brothers all came down with what Mallory  thought was just a viral infection but her symptoms progressed very quickly… she was off balance and eventually not able to move her arms or walk. First they thought she had meningitis and even Guillian-Barre Syndrome but after having a MRI they diagnosed her with Transverse Myelitis. Most cases have some kind of swelling in the spine but it’s usually a small amount however her case is severe  she has swelling on both sides of her spine from C-1 to T-10. Treatment started with high dose steroids and physical and occupational therapy  but after they didn’t see many improvements they started plasmapheresis  which is basically where they take out her plasma  and replace it with clean plasma. They have completed 3 of 5 treatments  doing the procedure every other day  and are currently talking about starting a treatment of IVIG once she finishes her last plasmapheresis treatment. As of right now we don't know exactly how long Ry will be in the hospital  it will for sure be at least another week before they are finished with the plasmapheresis. Once Ryleigh is finished with her treatment she will be looking at different therapy options  one which could be inpatient therapy and would include 3 hours of therapy daily if she is strong enough. Thankfully they are a military family and health insurance costs are not a worry as of now  but gas driving back and forth from the hospital every day and eating at the hospital adds up. The money raised will go to help them in any way that it can and that includes any equipment that Ryleigh will need once she is released. Some things we know she will be needing is a special wheelchair fitted for her  a potty chair that can fully support her  a bath chair  and diapers since she doesn’t have complete control of her bladder. Thank you so much for your support and your prayers!,1430,5000,10,29,28,210,6

Aart Van Kooy Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/aart-van-kooy-recovery-fund,8,Penticton,BC,On Sunday  October 7  2018  Aart and a few friends set out to ride the Sam I Am trail  located in the Skaha Bluffs area.  At the top of the climb  Aart snapped a few pictures and then ensured his dog  Enzo  was staying hydrated before beginning the descent.  Near the bottom of Sam I Am  Aart's handlebar clipped a tree  sending him over the bars and into the ground face-first.  The impact broke most of the bones in his face from the eye sockets down.In an amazing feat of strength  Aart managed to remain calm and  with the help of friends  he walked down the rest of the singletrack before jumping on a bike to coast himself down to the road.  He was first transported by ambulance to the hospital in Penticton and then  within hours  he was transferred to Kelowna  where he is currently in a medically-induced coma awaiting surgery. Aart has been on and around bikes for most of his life.  He has been successful in almost every racing discipline  from BMX  to downhill  to cross-country.  He is also a wizard-like mechanic  a mentor  a coach  and a trainer.  Through all of this  Aart has touched the lives of so  so many people  not only here in British Columbia  but truly worldwide.  Aart is always the guy with a smile on his face who is willing to go that extra step to help you out. If you aren’t one to stop in to see Aart at the Bike Barn  you’ve probably bumped into him and his wife Kerry out on the trails with Enzo not far out in front or behind.Aart's recovery time is uncertain at the moment  but the road to recovery will surely be long and expenses will quickly add up.  For anyone that wants to help Aart out  feel free to stop in at The Bike Barn to drop off a card  cheque or cash and we at the Barn will pass it on to the Van Kooy's.  If you cannot stop in  please use this GoFundMe page as an option to help.  If you need any information you can call the Bike Barn (250-492-4140) or email me info@bikebarn.ca,30790,25000,21,123,194,544,6

Pluto&apos;s top surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/pluto039s-top-surgery,0,Coburg,VIC,Hello! I am making a go fund me for my partner Pluto's (they/them) nineteenth birthday so they can get top surgery. They feel too guilty to make one of these themself because they acknowledge their white able body privellege. Never the less  they don't have the privellege of living in the body they should have. Pluto's double D breasts make their day to day dysphoria unbearable  binding is becoming too much and passing as a cis male at their university is very hard. They really need any form of financial donation  if you can't give any money sharing this is just as important. Just know that your money and support is going toward someone feeling comfortable in their body for the first time. Thank you very much!,585,8000,17,7,18,75,6
Come Fertility with Us!,https://www.gofundme.com/come-fertility-with-us,0,DENVER,CO,"What you should do first1. Read through our Go Fund Me page (below)2. Watch our “Come Fertility with Us” video to get a sense of who we are while we answer questions about our experience with infertility. https://youtu.be/rtfFUStsTOQ 3. Read Kristen’s corresponding blog post (goes into more depth about our story and what it feels like asking for financial help.) https://www.embraceyourunicorn.com/home/about-us-and-our-ivf-story Our inspiration for this campaignAt work  as a speech language pathologist working with individuals recovering from traumatic brain injuries  I (Kristen) have often encouraged patients to start GoFundMe campaigns to fundraise money for treatments that have not been covered by insurance. It’s really easy for me to encourage my patients to fundraise money for medical treatments  but it feels much harder for me to take my own advice. Cory and I first want to say thank you to all of my past patients who have bravely fundraised for treatments not covered by insurance in a very vulnerable time in their lives. I have witnessed these patients’ leaps of faith be met with kindness and generosity. Thank you  past patients  for inspiring us to do the same now. About UsHi everyone! We are Cory and Kristen Wendling –  two loving  doting parents-to-be in search of our own baby. I’m Cory  a ukulele player looking for someone to listen to my lullabies. I’m Kristen  a pseudo mother to my six younger siblings  longing to achieve full biological mother status some day.  Together  we are a tender  thoughtful duo ready to cover our baby in kisses and kindness.What HappenedAfter eight months of marriage  two ER visits  and one very expensive ovarian torsion surgery  we found out that we aren’t able to have children the conventional way. Because of Kristen’s congenital uterine anomaly (unicornuate uterus)  poor egg quality/quantity  and endometriosis (oh my!)  it was recommended that we immediately move to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in attempt to conceive. Long story short  we have completed one round of IVF. Because of my poor egg quality  we only got one genetically normal embryo from the first round of IVF (some women get up to 3 or 5 genetically normal embryos after a single cycle). And because my type of uterus has a 37% miscarriage rate  we decided to do a second round of IVF to try to get a couple more embryos just in case I miscarry our first embryo. All in all  we have paid over $35 000 in surgeries  fertility treatments  co-payments  diagnostic testing  and fertility supplements in the past five months. My OBGYN recommended that we seek treatment at one of the top fertility clinics in Colorado since I have so many complicating factors (i.e.  uterine anomaly  poor egg quality/quantity  endometriosis). Because of this  the IVF price tag at our clinic has been more expensive than at other smaller  less specialized clinics. How the money will be spentAll generous donations will be used to fund medical costs attributed to the IVF process: stimulation injections  egg retrieval surgery  fertilization  and embryo transfer process. Also  by giving to our GoFundMe venture  you are indirectly supporting Kristen’s efforts to educate and support a community of families facing similar hardships. Check out Kristen’s project  a blog devoted to helping herself and others learn to be okay about talking openly about infertility and other life challenges.Why should you “come fertility with us?”IVF is expensive  and we don’t think other couples going through it ask for help enough. Maybe because they don’t feel like it’s okay to ask for help. Maybe because infertility is hard to talk about  and money is even harder. Maybe because of pride and shame. Even though it’s uncomfortable to be vulnerable  it’s important. It’s a gateway to understanding. It cultivates compassion. It opens hearts and is a precursor to love. Despite it feeling uncomfortable for us to extend out hands out for help  Cory and I are going to embrace it. We are going to keep doing what we’ve been doing these past three months – put our story out there. Show that it’s okay to ask for help.  We are going to be vulnerable and voice our needs to you  our community. Meg Cabot once said  “Sometimes in life  you can fall down holes you can’t climb out of by yourself. That’s what friends and family are for – to help. They can’t help  however  unless you let them know you’re down there.” By choosing to support us  you’re saying  “I see you down in that hole  and I choose to help.” You’re saying yes to a more vulnerable  more compassionate world. You’re saying yes to a world where asking for help is met with warmth and generosity. You’re saying yes to a world where people don’t feel like they have to go at it alone.We are so gratefulTo show you our gratitude for your generosity  we are going to give you a small gift in return for your contribution! (We think this part is really exciting!) First  if you donate any amount at all  your picture will go in the “Gratitude Picture Book” we will be making for our future baby. This book will live on his/her bookshelf  and we’ll pull it out and read it to remember all of the people who helped make his/her life possible. Then  you’ll also receive a small gift for different monetary amounts you donate. More than anything  we want to show you through our words and actions that we deeply appreciate your generosity. For the gift levels  see below! $25-99 – Baby’s Footprints: After the baby is born  we will send you an autographed copy of the baby’s footprints. That’s right! At 3 months of age  our baby is going to be autographing baby merchandise. $100-199 – In addition to the baby’s footprints  you also receive a shout out from the baby in a gratitude video we’ll post on social media and Kristen’s blog. That’s right again! In addition to autographing merch  our baby is also going to be completely verbal by 3 months old! $200-299 – In addition to the baby’s footprints and video shout out  you’ll also receive an invitation to a donor thank you party we’ll be hosting at our home in the upcoming months. $300-499 – In addition to the baby’s footprints  video shout out  and donor party invite  you’ll also be invited to the baby’s first birthday party!$500+  - In addition to the baby’s footprints  video shout out  donor party invite  and first birthday party invite  you’ll also become an honorary aunt or uncle (fo’ real!)! We’ll celebrate your aunt-ness or uncle-ness by naming a small stuffed animal after you that will live in the baby’s nursery. (You think we’re joking? No way  José. Wait until you see all the weirdly named stuffed animals our baby will have because of your generous contributions. “This is Bob the giraffe and Carol the turtle!” Oh just you wait and see.)Will we be good parents? We understand that you might be asking yourself  “How can I trust that Kristen and Cory will even be good parents?” We get it  we get it. You want to make sure you’re wisely investing. To ease your hesitations  we asked our family and some friends for their opinions. “Cory and Kristen will be good parents because they are “goals.” They are so kind and always listen so intently to everything I have to say  and they make me feel so included and loved. They also take us to plays and out for ice cream and let us hang out with them all the time. And I love how much they love each other so much.”  -Bailey  Kristen’s 17-year-old sister “Would Cory and Kristen be good parents?  That’s a no brainer!  You are both kind  tolerant  patient  fun loving  honest  compassionate people.  It’s quite evident from seeing both of you around children that you love being around little ones!  Bob and I discussed this  and we believe that you will both be much better parents than the two of us were with our own children  and since we think that parenting is the most important thing we ever did in life  that’s saying a lot!” –Kay and Bob Lowe-Wendling  Cory’s parents“Kristen and Cory are going to give their kids a fun and stable environment to be raised in.” –Aleks  Kristen and Cory’s brother-in-law“My beautiful daughter  Kristen  blessed me when she was born!  She and Cory deserve the same blessing and would be such a loving  nurturing  and amazing mom and dad to their precious baby!” –Arnie  Kristen’s dad“I can’t wait to see them share the joy they have for the holidays with their child. We need some young blood at the children’s table at Wendling holiday gatherings. I’m the only one there right now…and I’m 39.” –Kevin Wendling  Cory’s cousin“Cory and Kristen will be amazing parents because they are so caring and sweet. Plus they love musicals so their kid will be raised right!” Eliana  Kristen’s 16-year-old sister“How do I intuitively know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Kristen and Cory would be good parents? I guess the same way I know a brilliant orange sunset over the Pacific is breathtaking. It’s next to impossible to put such innate knowledge into words  but here goes. I know they have both always longed to be parents… Kristen  since the time she could play with dolls or hold her baby sister. They’re both loving  patient  kind  understanding  compassionate  balanced  attentive  intelligent  committed  and fun. I just know somewhere in my heart of hearts  beyond my ken  Kristen’s and Cory‘s child will be the luckiest of the lucky.” -Doreen  Kristen’s mom\Everyone that knows Cory and Kristen already knows they will be exemplary parents  but even more than that  they'll set the bar for everyone around them. Think Cory or Kristen would bring a toddler on the plane without activities  or show up to soccer practice without orange slices  think again  they'll bring extra.\"" –Kyle Wendling  Cory’s brother “If there are any two people in the world that are meant to be parents  it’s Kristen and Cory. Kristen has been the absolute best older sister anyone could ask for; she’s the person to go to if you want to vent or need a ride or if you want to share some fries. Her motherly instincts are incomparable  and if anyone in the world is meant to be a mom  it’s Kristen. Cory is the same  except a male version. I have never laughed harder at anyone else’s jokes  and the amount of times he’s offered to go get ice cream is too many to count. All fun and games aside  though  Cory has a fatherly instinct as well  and I can’t wait to laugh at his dad jokes. I know that Kristen and Cory’s children will grow up to be amazing people  and I look forward to the chance to see them kick parenthood in the ass.” –Brooke  Kristen’s 17-year-old sister“Kristen and Cory aren’t going to be good parents…they already ARE good parents. Just looking at them take care of themselves as they harvest their future children  and the sacrifices they’re making is a prime example of why they already are the best parents out there.” –Karli  Kristen’s sister“Cory and Kristen will be GREAT parents because we all need a “Coristen” mini-me to bring more of their warmth  creativity  intellect  and amazing spirit to the world!” –Kim  Kristen and Cory’s boss (and friend)“Good parents stem from a special breed of person: diligent  patient  hard-working  resilient  resourceful and creative  Kristen and Cory not only have the elements of good parents  but they epitomize the characteristics of great ones: they are kind  accepting  caring  thoughtful  charming  goofy  funky  compassionate and most of all  they are loving. Any child would consider themselves lucky to have such an awesome mom and dad.” Shane and Kaitlin Miles  Kristen and Cory’s theatre buddies. What you can do next1. Donate!

Genetic testing &amp; medical expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/genetic-testingbefore-transplant,4,PASCAGOULA,MS,As most of you know  I was recently hospitalized and diagnosed with end stage renal (kidney) disease. Meaning that my kidneys are failing. Right now they are functioning at only 14 percent. I’ve started the process for insurance and have had to stop working full time due to my illness and the upcoming doctors visits and surgeries. Currently I am only working 5 hours a week.  I met with my new nephrologist yesterday and he believes that it is imperative my brother and I have genetic testing done as soon as possible before we start the process of seeing if he is a match for kidney donation. The doctor states that my brother will be my best bet for a living donor. Although I have others who are willing to be tested to see if they are a match. But because insurance has not taken effect  I am not able to have this done. I am hoping to raise enough money to cover the cost of the genetic testing so that we can get this part done ASAP. Anything would be appreciated and helpful. My doctor is hoping to be able to move quickly enough that I will be able to bypass dialysis all together and go straight to transplant. Here’s to hoping! And thank you to all who take the time to read  share or donate. This will mean the world to me and my family.  Any donations will be used for the genetic testing and any other unforseen medical expenses before insurance takes effect.

Ryan&#x2019;s Knee Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/ryans-knee-recovery-fund,9,IRVING,TX,As some of you may already know  Ryan injured his knee during an indoor soccer game over 3 months ago. Today  he finally went into surgery to repair the damage. Thankfully  all went well and now our main focus is his recovery. The Dr has asked that Ryan be non-weight bearing for at least 4 weeks. During those 4 weeks he won’t be able to drive being that his right knee is the one that is recovering. His plan was to return to work next week because he has not acrewed enough PTO to take off work for this to begin with  so the days he is out of work will be unpaid days  but with me still recovering from giving birth just 5 weeks ago  caring for our newborn son  and taking care of Ryan  driving him to work everyday is just not possible. For this reason we are reaching out for help in hopes that we can raise enough money so that Ryan can recover peacefully at home without the stress of prematurely returning to work and also loosing out on much needed income our family needs. We appreciate any amount you all are able to give and truly thank you from the bottom of our hearts. In Gratitude The Schexnayder Family,525,7500,11,7,6,41,6
Join Alera&apos;s Health Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/join-alera039s-health-journey,9,GRANDFORKS,ND,Alera Ivy Lorraine Keown was born on Friday  September 14  2018. Little Miss Alera has spent the first four weeks of her life in the NICU at Altru hospital in Grand Forks as she was diagnosed with Down Syndrome and has a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). She will require open heart surgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota to repair her heart. Alera will be air lifted to Mayo in the next few days (plans pending based on surgeon's and flight availability) to have her surgery and will spend approximately two weeks at Mayo during her recovery before returning to Grand Forks to begin her life at home with her family. Alera's Mom  Janalle  and her Grandma  Barb  will be making the trip to be with her during surgery  while Dad  Shawn  stays in Grand Forks to be with their three other children (Mason  14  Nova  13  Jamison  2). Janalle and Grandma Barb will be making several trips back and forth to Grand Forks during Alera's recovery. Once back in Grand Forks  Alera will need ongoing therapy in connection with the Down Syndrome diagnosis. Even with all of the amazing resources we've learned about in the last four weeks  we know that this is going to be an expensive time for the Keown family. This fund will be used for any unforeseen and uncovered expenses associated with travel  medical and other related expenses for Alera's family. We're asking if you would be willing to help support them financially during this time through this fundraising effort. This fundraiser was started by Alera's Aunt  Sarah Horak and will also be updated by Grandma Barb. Feel free to reach out with any questions. We love you and appreciate your support!,2210,5000,5,44,32,611,6

I also decided to donate to St Jude because they allow kids to be treated for free which I really appreciate because there are kids with cancer who don’t have money. My goal is to raise $1800 on gofundme. I am also doing other fundraisers such as bake sales  selling candy bars in school to raise more money. Finally I am going to visit some children’s hospitals to really understand where this money is going. It is one thing to sign a check  but another to see first hand what that check did. I really hope you can donate and help to find a cure. Thank you for reading this and I hope you can donate any amount.  ONE QUICK LAST NOTE: please try to donate before the end of March 2019 or early April 2019  thank you                          - Claudia J,1322,3000,39,44,14,7,6
Stacey (Angel) Steers Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/stacey-angel-steers-medical-fund,7,CINCINNATI,OH,STACEY (ANGEL) STEERS and her family needs our continued prayers and support!As many of you know  Stacey (Angel) Steers  suffered a severe brain bleed in early July of this year  resulting in a stroke at the age of 43 years old. The stroke has caused paralysis on the left side of her body as well as cognitive deficits. She has amazed all of us  including her doctors  with her courage  strength  and stamina. She has improved immensely and is fighting hard to be able to leave the rehab center and come home to her husband and 3 boys (Mikal  Mikal Jr.  Cody  and Luke). As you can imagine  being away from her husband and boys has been the hardest part of her healing journey. To compound this unfortunate health crisis  she has suffered for many years with a very rare disease  Mast Cell Activation Disorder  an immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators  resulting in a range of chronic symptoms  including anaphylaxis attacks on a monthly basis. Stacey has endured so much in young life!Due to her immediate health crisis  as well as many years of hospital treatment in intensive care  medical bills continue to overwhelm her family. In order to care for her at home  the Steer’s home will require reconstruction to enable accessible support for Stacey on a day to day basis. Many of you have expressed a desire to support Stacey and her family. This campaign will provide financial support to get their home accessible and prepared for her return as well as medical bills during this difficult time. Our family greatly appreciates your love  support  and prayers as Stacey continues to heal and gain back her independence. She has taught all of us so much through this journey of healing. With your generosity  our hope is to make her transition easier.   With Love and Gratitude   The Steers  Burns  and Angel Families,4725,35000,13,14,66,369,6
Dad&#x2019;s incurred Medical Expenses,https://www.gofundme.com/helpsupportEddie,0,SANDIEGO,CA,My dad( Eddie ) has had a really tough life with family members passing away.  The first significant loss was when I was 16 and my mom passed away with lung cancer.  I can remember that as if it was yesterday.  Before my mom passed she requested to stay home instead of the hospital.  At that time she had about two weeks to live.  Every night before she feel asleep she wanted my dad to read her the Bible and say a prayer for her.  Through that process my dad came to know the Lord.      I’ve always believed that everything happens for a reason and sometimes we don’t know what those reasons are until a couple of days  weeks and sometimes years pass before we realize that “why”.     Two weeks after my mom passed away  my grandma passed away of a broken heart for her daughter who just passed.  That made my dad question God-why would He take away amazing people in our lives.  Unfortunately  these are questions that we may never get answered until the day we are face to face with the Lord.      After a couple months past my dad decided to move to Indiana with his good friend Dawn who years later became his wife.  They did everything together and they loved each other very much.  He was married to Dawn for 12 years.  In 2008 my dad had a stroke that paralyzed his left side and made him not be able to work again.  My dad was one of the hardest working people I know.  It was very tough on he and Dawn financially and physically as my dad wasn’t able to do much with one arm.      Fast forward to today  October 9th  Dawn passed away in her sleep from a massive heart attack. It was very unexpected for everyone. My dad is unable to work  and could use some help paying the bills. If you can donate to help my dad  I know he would appreciate it and I will be extremely grateful as well. Thank you for reading this and considering donating.,2865,5000,21,57,26,71,6

They believe the point of origin was on or around a power strip.Woken up around midnight to the sound of the smoke alarms  Grant  and his buddy who was spending the night  saw that a fire had started in his room. After calling 911  they tried their best to put out the fire  but were soon overcome by the fire  heat and smoke. It became an uncontrollable blaze that very quickly spread throughout the home. They were very fortunate that no one was badly injured and it was contained before it spread to surrounding homes (thank you NBFD!).  Unfortunately  damage to their (rental) home was extensive  and all of their belongings virtually turned to a smoked mess or disintegrated heap of ash.  They were left with the clothing on their backs. Yes  they have renters insurance. Yes  the structure was properly insured. But they are left with the immediate task of finding a place to live as well as start the expensive task of rebuilding a semblance of a normal life/home (clothing for one!) so Tracy can get back to work as an independent contractor court reporter and Grant can go back to being a high school junior.  Not only that  Tracy  the renter  is responsible for lawfully removing the enormous amount of debris from the interior of the house - an entire house  a lifetime of possessions. While there will be indemnification from the insurance (but who carries enough?!)  that will take months. Because Tracy is always the one helping  donating  and contributing to NHHS and others in need  and has never been on this side of the situation  she is shy about asking for help. But I'm not! Beautiful karma  I say. Please help this single mom and her son get their life back to as normal as possible as they wade through the aftermath of this devastating fire. The outpouring of donated clothing and gift cards etc. - from strangers - has already been wonderfully heartwarming. But she needs an influx of cash for all the immediate expenses:  downpayment on a rental  basic necessities etc. Every dollar helps. Please give what you can. Thank you so much for your consideration and generosity!!! Tracy is eternally grateful for this community and wants to share these lessons: * Put fire extinguishers in every bedroom or at least bathrooms. Under the kitchen sink is not always easily accessible. Teach your kids how to use it and the different types of fires. ** Have the recommended amount of smoke alarms  and replace the damn batteries (this saved their lives)! More to come from her after she becomes an expert on fire damage  the aftermath and recovery.,2120,5000,17,42,28,106,6

Nevaeh&apos;s Cure for Epilepsy,https://www.gofundme.com/neveah039s-hope,7,SAINTPAUL,MN,November  28th 2016 at the age of 13  my daughter Nevaeh suffered her first Gran Mal/Tonic Clonic seizure in choir class. Because I work in Natural Health I assessed her first and then my first stop was to a colleague of mine  a Chiropractic Neurologist. We then went to the ER and then a neurologist to get an EEG and MRI. Everything at the ER was normal along with the MRI  but her EEG showed seizure type activity. Her first neurologist diagnosed her with conclusive non-conclusive generalized epilepsy and the first words out of his mouth were Keppra  an anti-seizure medication. So basically  all they knew was  conclusively she had a seizure  and non-conclusively they have no idea why she had a seizure. There is no familial history on either side. Working in natural health I could not accept that there was not a cause  and after 13 years of life  that all of a sudden you start having seizures. The neurologist denied that heavy metal toxicity could be a possible source even though when I tested her she tested positive for heavy metal toxicity and never mind the fact that the brain is an electrochemical organ and a heavy metal would cause short circuiting. There were a few other contributing factors that we also found. There was a small chance that she would never have another seizure again and I wasn’t going to just throw her on drugs that have all kinds of side effects including white blood cell disorders and other diseases! I wanted to try and get her body to heal by itself first naturally  and then if we could’t manage the seizures  we’d consider medicinal marijuana  and then pharmaceuticals. We put her on a ketogenic diet instantaneously after that first seizure for six months to reduce inflammation. Ironically  I had studied the ketogenic diet extensively a year and a half prior for weight loss  diabetes  and athletic endurance. We had immediately begun treating any nutritional deficiencies with whole food supplements in addition to removing heavy metals and treating immune challenges. That was not her only seizure. She had one 3 weeks later  then another one a month later  then 2 months  then 3 months  then 4 months  and finally a 6 month stretch. 7 months after the first seizure and many hours of research we added in 100% CBD oil.With the addition of the CBD  we had gotten that 6 months stretch and then hormones began gearing up in March and we had 3 seizures in 8 weeks. So we adjusted her CBD’s and got another 4 month stretch until right after her first cycle. Our current neurologist agreed that we are managing her seizures well and he didn’t think we would get any better results on medicinal marijuana and that medication wouldn’t change any of the other factors in her life  except for added side effects. There are no side effects with our natural treatments. (And for those who don’t know  the HEMP CBD oil has zero THC-the psychoactive substance in it).While managing seizures well without drugs is fine  it’s wasn’t enough. I wanted her body healed so she could be completely seizure free. If you haven’t seen the movie Lorenzo’s Oil  let me give you a synopsis  but I am  that parent. Lorenzo’s oil is a true story about a mother and father who were doctors that battled against the odds to save their son’s life. Lorenzo had been diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease  but their persistence and faith lead them to a cure that saved his life and now Lorenzo’s oil is available to those with ALD.Epilepsy is not a rare disease  but to the medical profession it is incurable and only manageable with pharmaceuticals. Epilepsy has changed our family’s life. Nevaeh must have 24 hour around the clock supervision  so there is a lot of juggling to try to manage that. She cannot drive yet. She cannot take a bath  only showers. She cannot climb trees  she cannot sleep in bunk beds  she cannot cook in the kitchen alone. At this time I have to restrict her overnight visits with friends at their homes and amusement park activities. She cannot swim without someone right by her side. She is a sophomore in high school  so this has been emotionally challenging for her as well. Medication at this time would not change any of that for her. Watching your child have a seizure is nothing short of terrifying  always hoping it will stop and not turn into a medical emergency or Sudden Unexpected Death from Epilepsy (SUDEP). However  like Lorenzo’s parents I am determined  persistent  and have faith that her body will heal completely and she will be free of seizures without supplements  pharmaceutical  or any invasive surgery.Over the last 2 years of extensive research and working with colleagues  Nevaeh now has HOPE! After the first year of research I took a sabbatical so that I could home school her and begin working on the development of a new healing technique. The technique is 100% non-invasive  non-surgical  non-pharmaceutical  and supplement free. In 10-15 treatments it will provide her body with the necessary information to correct and heal itself. The technique will work to assist bodies in healing themselves of a myriad of different diseases and chronic conditions. We are in the final stages of completion and need help. Being on sabbatical has depleted our ability to bring the healing technique to full fruition. In order to finish the work we need funding to do the final testing and complete case studies; in addition  to acquiring the licensing necessary to provide the services across all borders.We are asking for assistance in helping us complete our work  so not only can Nevaeh experience a life free of health restrictions; also that we can share this gift of healing with all those who seek a natural resolution to their health concerns.   It will take approximately 6-7 months from the time we can begin completing our work for Nevaeh  to begin her healing treatments; in addition  to offering it to our communities.  Our ultimate dream is to open a healing oasis where people can come and stay for the duration of their treatment time  where they will learn the cause/s of their health concerns  and learn how to retain optimal health so they are free to share their special gifts with the world. Lets face it  when you are consumed by a health crisis  chronic limiting symptoms  and pain  you are not able to live your life to its fullest potential and pay it forward! Along side the healing oasis will be a non-profit so that no one has to be denied the gift of health and wellness. Please help us relieve unnecessary suffering.More information about the healing technique will be provided as it nears completion. I will provide an email if anyone would like to contact us. Thank you for taking your time to read our story and consider us. We are deeply grateful.,623,623,18,100,13,46,6

Despite two surgeries  chemotherapy  radiation  and countless scans  tests  and consultations  Greg’s cancer has returned and is unfortunately unstoppable this time around.

Jase&#x2019;s Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/son-has-medical-issues,0,DUBUQUE,IA,Hi    My name is Ruth Matthews and Danielle and I have been best friends since we were 13 years old. We have gone through a lot of milestones together and the most significant one being motherhood. I have had the privilege of learning a lot from Danielle  especially over the last year while she has gone through a lot of trials and tribulations with Jase all while adding another baby to the mix.  A few weeks ago Danielle shared a post about the Iowa city children’s hospital and their experience. It’s copied below for your reference. Naturally  the unpaid time off work for appointments  medical costs and trying to manage a family can be overwhelming. Danielle is not one to ask for anything she hasn’t worked hard to get herself  but has always been a helping hand and loving ear whenever needed. If you can share this link  and/or donate what you can for this little boy and his family to get ahead on the medical costs associated with all of this  it would be greatly appreciated.    This last year has been a rollercoaster... and emotionally exhausting to say the least. Trying to juggle my job  being a good mom to 2 other kids while doing whatever I could to help Jase as well. It has been a struggle for me... at times my head is spinning just thinking about my week to week schedule between the kids and Jases physical therapy and all of his doctor appointments. Then with him constantly getting sick.. along with 2 other kids that also need me.  Driving back and forth from Iowa city has now become a routine. A few weeks back we met with a specialist at the center of disease and disability. I am not going to lie... I thought this would just be another appointment where I get the same overall explanation but yet no true diagnosis and reason to explain everything. After 4 hours of talking with this doctor I finally had faith that we are on the right path. He was able to give me some answers or at least explanations that no other doctor could. He also made me feel like I wasn’t crazy! After telling doctor after doctor that there was something wrong and everything that he has is tied together.. this doctor agreed and explained why. It was like a little weight was finally lifted off my shoulders. As relieved as I was.. this is just the beginning of many more appointments and tests. This doctor is taking over Jases case and will oversee everything in the future. Jase was then referred to 8 more specialist to do more tests so we can somewhat start from the beginning again. In the end the doctor will go over everything to see exactly what we are all dealing with. The day I had Karli.. September 14th of last year was also the day we finally got confirmation from an evaluation that there was something more wrong with Jase like I thought. Fast forward to beginning of May this year.. we got a referral to do an MRI at the children’s hospital more for just confirmation of what we thought was just a cerebral palsy diagnosis. This day will forever be one of the hardest/scariest days I have had yet as a mom. Not only did Jase have to be put under for the MRI.. which I was completely terrified about... I got news I was not expecting to hear. I was told I would get results back in a few days and they would call. As I am driving home.. about 40 minutes away still I lost service... which made me miss a call from the pediatric neurologist. I had a voicemail... as I listened I had to stop and just pull over. She asked for me to call her back about the results. Of course... worst case scenario goes through my head considering they told me I wouldn’t have any results for days. I Called back and was told it wasn’t just a stroke like they thought. That his left side of the brain has damage...but they aren’t sure why... so now here we are working with the center of disability and disease. So many more appointments ahead of us. But I know the children’s hospital is amazing and we are in good hands. Jase would not be where he was today without the doctors we’ve seen and all of his therapist we have been working with over the last year. All I can do is just keep trying to do what’s best for him and pray for the best.,650,3000,5,22,6,101,6
Help Cat Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/Help-Cat-Fight-Cancer,1,Dunsborough,WA,￼Help Cat Fight Cancer Our beautiful friend Cat needs our help. Our aim is simple; to relieve the financial burden during the harrowing journey she is about to embark upon. In August this year  a day before her birthday  Cat was diagnosed with very aggressive Stage 4 breast cancer. Within weeks Cat had undergone a double mastectomy and was immediately called back in to remove remaining lymph’s due to additional tumours being detected. She is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiation where she will; in the multiple doctors’ own words… “ Be blasted” for the next 6 months. Anyone that knows Cat knows that if she had it her way she would quietly fight this on her own  being the incredible proud  unassuming and regal woman she is. She’s still grappling with the knowledge that we have even set up this page  reaching out so far and wide. But she’s not Admin so she can’t do anything about it  ha! But we’d risk her ire because Cat is an incredibly loyal  loving and giving friend who has always put others before herself. One of the many proofs of her selflessness is that she moved away from her haven Byron Bay to become the primary carer for her beautiful mum Toni who lives in Perth. A responsibility she was proud and honoured to take on  out of love and respect. Through this whirlwind of challenges  Cat has been incredibly brave  pragmatic as always  often hilarious  and stoic throughout the entire process. Her only vulnerable moment was the fear of losing her sanctuary. Her lovely and much loved little apartment in Cottesloe. When everything else was out of her control she couldn’t bare the thought of her place of escape to be taken from her as well. So  our goal is to raise $60 000 to cover cost of rent  bills  and any out of pocket medical cost. We don’t want her to deal with the stress the financial impact will have on her ability to recover successfully. We will endeavour to keep everyone updated on further developments and the progress of the treatments. Thank you with all our hearts for anything you can contribute.Let’s help Kick Cancers Ass and please share.Much Love...Cats gang xxx,18530,60000,17,31,63,254,6
Julie&apos;s Journey:Happiness &amp; Healing,https://www.gofundme.com/yyx8z-julie039s-journey,1,LAGRANDE,OR,In late September Julie Gregory and Robb Gregory were given the devastating news Julie has aggressive uterine cancer.  For the last three years Julie has quietly scheduled appointments and procedures in hopes of finding an answer to her daily pain and nausea. While test after test came back inconclusive and her concerns were dismissed-  Julie and Robb continued to push doctors to listen as she knew something was wrong. After finally convincing a doctor that she was not too young for a hysterectomy  she underwent surgery only to discover that she was right all along; they found a large tumor and various other cancer masses in her reproductive system. A surgery intending to relieve Julie of the painful symptoms she had endured for  3 years instead blindsided the family with the ugly truth- Julie has endometrial cancer. Having someone as young  vibrant and caring as our ‘Nanny’ be diagnosed with cancer was a blow to many.  Julie’s life centers around her love for her 8 grandchildren and their many friends and teammates  her children and their spouses  and of course her husband- her constant love and giving nature is beyond measure  and so many people in this world have been blessed by her desire to give and to help others. Julie is still in the early stages of the diagnosis. Terms are being learned. Tears are being shed. Hugs are being given. Cancer is being staged. Surgeries are being scheduled. Treatments are being discussed. And a family is moving towards healing. While they are just at the beginning of this journey  we know that they will need every bit of support that they can get from their community. Thank you for joining us as we support Julie through her journey.  Your love  prayers  and support are a blessing that is sincerely appreciated.  Any money raised will go towards Julie’s healing journey- be it for fuel to get to and from appointments  covering the cost of bills so that Robb can attend appointments with her  paying outstanding medical bills not covered by insurance  or special moments that she may need to maintain a positive mental outlook. As someone who is so endeared by so many  we know that Julie faces a battle  but it is a battle that will not be faced alone- we know that each and every step will be filled with the love and light of family  friends  and strangers placed by God to help her as she heals. As things move forward  we will continue to update you all on Facebook-- search for the group Julie’s Journey: Happiness & Healing and request to join. We cannot thank you enough for all of the love and support you give to Julie and Robb. As one of Austie's best friends  my kids and I had the chance to get to know Nanny. I have never  in my life met a person as caring and kind as she. Whenever we make the long drive from CA  there are always seats for us around the family dinner table on Sunday nights. If my kids ask  the answer is yes. We are like family. To receive this news  it was hard for me to take. How can someone so loving and so kind have this happen? But I know with her family beside her  Julie can fight. So if you're my friend on Facebook  trust me  there is nobody out there better to support.,6820,75000,6,9,68,1000,6
Service Dog Needed!,https://www.gofundme.com/x2prdd-service-dog-needed,7,JACKSONVILLE,FL,Hey everyone  my name is Sara Curry! I have been diagnosed with 3 chronic illnesses within the year  one of these being POTS  a form of Dysautonomia. POTS stands for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and caused debilitating symptoms. When a normal person stands up from a laying or sitting position the blood vessels in their legs shrink so that their blood is distributed throughout their body. When someone with POTS stands up this dose not happen  causing a majority of their blood to pool to their legs. This causes their heart rate to jump very high and their blood pressure to drop  resulting is extremely difficult symptoms; symptoms can vary in intensity from person to person. For me it causes extreme cognitive issues (such as headaches  brain fog and bad memory)  blurred vision  blacked out vision   dizziness/lightheartedness  shortness of breath  chest pain  gastrointestinal problems  weakness  temperature regulation problems  and passing out spells. Living with this condition and having it get progressively worse has taken my life and freedom away. I'm afraid of going out alone for fear I might have sever symptoms  as well as not being able to hardly stand for more than 5 minutes without needing to lie down. Being a teenager with this means having to quite my favorite sport  having to drop out of school and do online school  never being able to committee to plans  losing friends  and so much more. After doing a bunch of research I came across the idea of a medical alert dog/service dog. This dog would be trained to help me carry things  provide balance support  retrieve items  perform deep pressure therapy  and be able to alert to a drop in blood pressure or cardiac changes. This dog would mean getting my life and independence back. The only thing in the way of this is the extreme price  no one has a couple thousand bucks that they can pull out of their pocket  even when it comes to medical stuff. So I ask everyone of you to just donate 1 or 2 dollars  every dollar counts! No matter how small or insignificant the amount may seem  I promise you that you're making a difference and helping me with this next step in my medical journey. I would also like to ask everyone to please share this on any social media platform  even just one share can make a huge difference. Thank you all I am so grateful to even have the opportunity to apply for a service dog and have an amazing community to support me! You are all making a difference no matter how small it may seem!- Live your best life (:,745,3000,13,25,17,95,6

Sandra Strong,https://www.gofundme.com/SandraStrong4,9,PUEBLO,CO,Hello  My name is Justin Miklich and the purpose of this campaign is to help with medical expenses and prayer for my wife  Sandra. We have been married for almost 20 years and have 2 teenagers ( a senior and a sophomore) who attend PCHS.      In June  my wife was hospitalized for a week with para influenza which actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It was discovered through a CT scan for her lungs that she had an enlarged pancreas and cirrhosis of the liver.      Since then she has been seeing a specialist and through more detailed blood work  an upper endoscopy and a liver biopsy  she was diagnosed as a carrier of Hereditary Hemochromatosis. She was born with this and it is also called Iron Overload Disorder.  Excess iron can poison organs  which can lead to conditions such as cancer  irregular heartbeat  and cirrhosis of the liver.     Sandra is at stage 4 liver cirrhosis damage and was told that the damage is irreversible and she will need a liver transplant. She is currently working with the doctor to try to decrease the high iron levels through phlebotomy once a week. In hemochromatosis  therapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood from a person's body with the specific goal of reducing iron overload. She will continue to be monitored and if her liver turns to cancer before they can get her iron levels decreased  she will go to the top of transplant list.     We are unsure of medical expenses surrounding all these procedures  hospitals  and transplant both in the present and in the future and find it very overwhelming.  My co-workers  family  and friends have been such a blessing to us during this difficult and confusing time. So many people have approached me to help without even being asked and we are so appreciative and thankful for all of you.         If you are able to donate  we are extremely thankful and appreciative and would also be very blessed if you keep Sandra and my family in your prayers. We will keep our faith in God and his plan for us.Thank you Justin Miklich and family,2380,5000,21,48,39,102,6
Rehoming Sarah&apos;s Kidney,https://www.gofundme.com/rehoming-sarahs-kidney,4,STEGER,IL,"Over the summer on a garage-sale adventure  my family happened across a sign at the end of a driveway staring \All proceeds go to find a kidney for Courtney\"".

But it got me thinking.I went back to the house to find Courtney and get some info on this whole kidney thing. After making it home with all of our treasures I got to doing some research. Currently  according to the U.S. Department of Health  there are over 114 000 people waiting for organ transplants. On average  every ten minutes someone is added to the national transplant list. While kidney donation is definitely a major surgery  there are a lot more myths than facts out there. After donation  while you do have to be careful  your remaining kidney actually increases in size to make up for the missing one! Living donation does not affect life expectancy and in some cases actually increases it due to the need to the increased attention to your health.Mike and I did A LOT of research  praying  and talking with family and decided that I was going to call the Mayo Clinic where Courtney is registered for transplant and start the process to see if I could be a match. I've been evaluated by my own doctor and given the ok  sent 3 years of medical records to Mayo for evaluation  had an interview with a nurse and a social worker to make sure that I'm basically healthy and of sound mind to understand the process and that there is a support group for me to help  and sent bloodwork to Mayo for typing to make sure I'm a blood match. So far  everything has come back clear!!As of yesterday  I am up to the final step before we can schedule the actual donation. I will have to make a trip from the south suburbs of Chicago  Illinois to Rochester  Minnesota for three days for the final evaluation and meets with the surgery team. During this time  I will obviously miss work and will need to cover costs to travel  stay  and eat. If I pass this testing  the surgery process will have Mike and I staying in Minnesota for about a week while I have the surgery. Barring anything extraordinary  we will check in the day before surgery  have surgery the next day and I should be discharged within 48 hours after that. Because we aren't local to the hospital  they request that I stay close for a couple of days afterward so they can monitor my recovery and be available if anything needs to be followed up on.  After I get back home  I'll be off work for anywhere from two to six weeks for recovery. I'll have to go back to the Mayo Clinic at the 4  6  and 12 month points for follow up visits and then periodically after that. While Courtney's insurance company covers the surgery  the costs associated with travel and being off work do add up and this is the reason I've started this page. Any funds raised from this page will go directly to expenses related to my travel and maintaining bills while I'm off work. If for whatever reason  I don't pass through this final testing stage  I will transfer the funds raised to Courtney to apply to her costs. If you'd like to check out her gofundme you can do so here:  https://www.gofundme.com/ej24h-kidneypancreas-transplantAnything that you can help with is greatly appreciated and I'll be sure to keep everyone updated on the status of things. Right now  I need to sit with Mike and decide when we can get out to Mayo for this testing!Thanks so much for reading and sharing!!!""",160,5000,3,3,5,146,5
Help Dan &amp; His Young Family -Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/ddfbp-help-dan-amp-his-young-family-cancer,1,Camberwell,VIC,Daniel Varkal  age 33  loving husband and father of two beautiful  young children  has Stage 4 melanoma brain cancer. He recently had surgery to remove one of the tumours from his brain  the surgery was successful however there are 5 tumours remaining which are inoperable and the prognosis isn't good.Daniel Varkal is married to Monique  age 27 and they have a son named Ethan  age 5 and a daughter named Maia  age 3.  They live in a small town called Plettenberg Bay  in South Africa with Monique's father  who has been in a wheelchair since she was 9 years old. Before Daniel's illness  they were working hard to try to achieve financial stability for their family. It is incredibly difficult to find steady and well paying jobs in this rural and seasonal small town. With Daniel unable to work  Monique is now the sole caretaker and earner for their whole family. At this point  she has a part time job in a jewellery store. The tumours were discovered just 12 weeks ago  after Dan suffered a stroke. An MRI scan was performed and revealed the tumours. They scheduled a biopsy surgery to determine if the tumours were malignant or benign. During the period between the scan and the surgery however  Dan started having seizures and a decision was made to remove one of the tumours which was suspected to be the cause of the onset epilepsy. Tests were performed on the removed tumour and it was revealed that Daniel is in fact in stage 4 of Melanoma Cancer with severely advanced brain metastases. They are attempting aggressive and costly radiation and chemotherapy treatments. My name is Kaylee  a friend of the family  I've set up this GoFundMe as an attempt to raise urgent funds to help support Daniel and Monique and try to make this heartbreakingly difficult time just a little bit easier for them.  The pain and stress this family is experiencing is unbearable and with Daniel's medical costs and loss of income they are in serious trouble. These are good  kind people and the unthinkable has happened to them. Please  please help! Donate as much as you can and help us share this campaign. Thank you so much <3UPDATE 10th October 2018 - Daniel has just completed 10 consecutive days of aggressive and painful radiation treatments. He will need to recover over the next 2 to 3 weeks and then his doctors will perform more tests to establish how the tumors are looking and what the next steps will be (possibly chemotherapy).  Daniel is staying very brave and strong and is so grateful for all the love and support he and his family have received. UPDATE 27th November 2018 -The support  generosity and compassion everyone has shown for Daniel and his gorgeous family is astounding. Thank you so much everyone! Dan has undergone the high risk  painful radiation treatments and thankfully he pulled through them without suffering any permanent or debilitating side effects.  It has been decided  together with Daniel's oncology team and family  that his best chance of recovery is an advanced treatment program at the Sheba Hospital in Tel Aviv  Israel. This hospital is highly specialised and one of only two in the world using this ground breaking method of treatment. Daniel arrived in Israel on Sunday the 25th of November and will stay there for approximately 3 months to undergo his treatments. It was an incredibly tough decision to have Dan continue this journey without his wife and children at his side. Thankfully he has a large support group in Israel comprised of his Parents  Sister  Grandmother and other family and friends  all eager to care for him. All of your donations have made it possible to get Danny this far and give him the best possible chance of overcoming this fight and we are so grateful. There will be many more medical expenses incurred as well as costs associated with supporting Monique and the children while Daniel is away. Please continue sharing Dan's story and supporting as much as you can so we can help him get through this fight!,8641,10000,8,86,100,1000,6
Hudsyn&apos;s Journey with AFM,https://www.gofundme.com/swgu4-one-in-a-million,0,ROCKFALLS,IL,"￼￼In September of this year our Huddy came down with a typical cold  cough and runny nose  no big deal then he came home from school on a Wednesday and complained of his neck hurting  I thought maybe he was getting a headache but just to make sure it was nothing serious I had him bend over and touch his toes and turn his head side to side  he did. By that Friday he was complaining of his arm being broken  I thought he was joking as he wasn't acting funny or complaining of pain and is kind of a practical joker. Saturday morning  came and he was screaming in pain  he couldn't sit up  he could not move his head and was having a hard time walking. Immediately we took him to walk in clinic where they sent him straight to the ER for an C T of his head and an crazy of his left arm which by this time was completely limp hanging by his side. The ER could not find anything his tests to give answers besides the fact that he had bronchitis and sinusitis  they treated him with antibiotics and sent us home telling us if he got worse to take him to an ER that was better equipped to handle this as he would need a lumbar puncture done. A few hours later  Hudsyn wasn't any better so we called the doctor that saw him that morning and she advised us to take him to the hospital right away however the two local hospitals said they would just send him to a different hospital so we drove an hour to one of the hospitals they would have sent him to. Huddy had a lumbar puncture done and another slew of tests and was admitted. I'm the morning he under  went an MRI of his brain and we met with a pediatric neurologist  he suspected Guillian Barre Syndrome as Hudsyn had lost all reflexes of his left leg and use of his left arm accompanied by lower extremity weakness. The MRI came back clean and the next day he had some reflexes back in his left leg so this ruled out GBS  but now he was falling  legs just giving out on him  his gait was off so he would run into walls and he had neck pain and couldn't turn his head. Eventually he started therapy and and we were told he was improving after a few days i.e. not getting worse  sent home being told we might never have answers but to continue OT/ PT outpatient  and wait for the West Nile & Lyme disease tests to come back. Huddy started therapy the next week  after therapy we made a stop at the gas station  and in the matter of seconds he fell head first into the ground  see his legs would still give out on him and he could catch himself because of his left arm being paralyzed. It was awful to see  that wasn't the last horrible fall my baby would take either. I called the pediatric neurologist and told her what happened and was immediately given an appointment for him. Hudsyn went through another MRI  nothing  and was referred to a children's a hospital in Chicago  we go January 7th and hope they can give us answers. We also have an appointment with a well known rehab hospital in Chicago so they can give us a custom rehab plan for Hudsyn. To wrap up though because I could go on and on  we still have 0  answers as to why our healthy  active 5 year old boy became paralyzed and weakened. Hudsyn still can't use his upper left arm and has weakness in both  of his legs. He continues to go to therapy once a week and tries to do things he did before some he can do with improvising and some he can't. Never once had this sweet little boy asked \why me?\"" He trusts that we will help to get better along with the doctors  and therapists however we just  don't know how much better it will get for him. As a parent you always give your child what they need without question and that is what we are trying to do for Hudsyn  however finances are super tight as I am at home with him to run him to all of his appointments  take calls from the doctors and because he is only in school half days as the doctor ordered. Hudsyn goes to PT/OT once a week for now  was going to the chiropractor twice a week and was taking liposomal vitamin c but we can't afford the last two anymore. We really dislike discontinuing any of his treatment as he has been making progress and we don't know if it's because of all of what we have been doing or not. Our insurance doesn't cover the chiropractor as we haven't met our deductible yet  my husband changed jobs after 13 years right before Hudsyn got sick so we were without insurance for 30 days  and each visit is between $40-$65 a visit and the vitamin c that he was taking is to help with nerve damage however it is over the counter and around $90 for a month's worth. I said from day one we would find a way to get him everything he needed s o he had every chance to get back to his baseline self but now we are at a crossroads because we have to choose between investing in  his treatment across the board  or our mortgage and living expenses. We just can't afford the $600 plus out of pocket on top of his therapy costs every month any more and that is why with my head down I am sharing his story and asking for help. Please help us help Hudsyn to be himself again  being able to run without the fear of falling  climbing like a monkey on our trellis out front  lol  and being able to go out in public without being self conscious. No matter what we find out we know one thing for sure  our Hudsyn is one in a million!  https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Polio-like-illness-reaches-young-boy-in-Rock-Falls-Illinois-497121571.html""",1450,5000,5,29,28,472,4

"Helping Kallie, An Amputee Learning To Walk Again",https://www.gofundme.com/gates-of-steel,7,SANTAMONICA,CA,My name is Jo Anna Provencher and I have created this GoFundMe page for my dear and closest friend Kallie Gates.  She is a loyal friend  amazing mother of two  awesome wife and one incredibly strong woman. Recently  she was diagnosed with a rare cancer in her right foot and now  is a new amputee.Over the summer  doctors discovered a rare soft tissue cancer in the middle of her right foot. The specific diagnosis was malignant peripheral nerve sheath sarcoma. The tumor measured 8cm x 3.5cm. The size and location of the tumor caused constant excruciating pain and limited surgical options. The malignant tumor had been growing inward and eroding her heel bone but went undetected as a result of the normal swelling of feet during pregnancy. Due to the complexity of the tumor and in order to obtain a clear margin  doctors said it would be impossible to remove the tumor in a way that would leave her with a functional foot afterwards. To get the best quality of life after surgery  Kallie was informed that she would need to have a below the knee amputation on her right leg. Due to the circumstances and to decrease the cancer reoccurring  it was an easy decision for her to make  yet a difficult one to come to grips with. She had the amputation on August 30th  2018... A day that changed her life forever. Thankfully  as of now  chemotherapy is not necessary. Although she still has to undergo surveillance which includes regular CT scans. Physical therapy will be required so she can regain her ability to walk and hopefully jog one day.  Additionally  she’ll need continual prosthetic fittings because her limb will continue to change as her muscle atrophies. Prosthetics will provide Kallie freedom in being able to once again keep up with her young girls and to continue kicking ass at life. As people have asked what they can do in lieu of bringing over a meal or sending flowers this GoFundMe page has been created for those that would like to contribute towards the cost of ongoing medical fees and the variety of prosthetics she will need. Insurance covers a basic prosthetic leg. With a young family and a strong desire to be athletic again  Kallie will require different types of prosthetics. These would include both a life like silicone prosthetic for everyday use and a running blade prosthetic to keep her active and healthy  both of which can cost up to $20 000 each. Typically a prosthetic will last 3-5 years with normal wear and tear. Kallie and her entire family have been so optimistic  strong and united throughout this entire life changing diagnosis and journey. Those that surround her are in complete awe of her beautiful and resilient soul. If you would like to participate in witnessing her heartfelt story with us  she created an Instagram account to follow her journey as an amputee due to sarcoma. @mrsmightyrighty  Your support is appreciated for this truly inspiring person and her young and unbelievably admirable family as they focus on her continual healing and hopeful return to normalcy.,20465,60000,23,34,140,328,5

Help Suzzette Fight Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/love-army-for-single-mom-with-rare-cancer,1,OLDSMAR,FL,I met Joy Suzzette McHugh when she was just 18 years old and full of life. After not hearing from her for almost 20 years we connected via Facebook. Come to find out she has been suffering for the last several years with a rare form of Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer. Suzzette is a single mom of two beautiful daughters. To see them go through this with their mom is saddening. One daughter is only 10 years old. The other is trying to make her way through college.Suzzette was diagnosed in 2016 with Stage 3 Colorectal Cancer. She battled it for a year with chemotherapy and radiation. She was diagnosed again with Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer that moved into the lymp nodes in 2018 and she battled it once again with chemotherapy and radiation. She finished all procedures in February 2019. After doing a PET scan last month they found that the cancer has moved into her lungs. What was once a fight that seemed victorious has come back again and this time its life or death.Suzzette is in need of advanced medical procedures. Since 2016 she has barely made bills and is now completely out of money. If she doesn't get the support she needs she may not be with us in the coming months.We are requesting immediate funds to assist with all aspects of treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and to help support her two children. She has not been able to generate any income during this period of time and friends and family are exhausted on funding. We need others to help support her and her family.Any small donation would go a long way to help support Suzzette's condition and to help her two girls.Joe Wattam (life long friend of Suzettte McHugh),1550,50000,17,3,19,74,12

The Hopkins Family,https://www.gofundme.com/vgtdz-the-hopkins-family,9,AUDUBON,NJ,This is Dave Hopkins  one of my closest friends from high school. He was recently diagnosed with stage four subcutaneous metastasized melanoma. He and his amazing wife  Amanda  have 2 beautiful twin daughters Laura and Jolene. They have already overcome difficult challenges with the health of their girls; Laura only just recently is living without a trach that she had in place for about 3 years of her young life. Dave went into the hospital thinking he was having a heart attack  and instead discovered he has cancer. It has quickly spread to his liver  kidneys  lungs  and heart  among other places. There is a random mass in his chest and one on his sacral spine that has done a lot of damage. There are random tumors showing up under his skin and also a tumor in his brain called a meningioma. Dave already has osteoarthritis  degenerative disc disease  and sciatica. The drugs and treatment he must now take make these much worse as the side effects have him constantly flaring up. Moving his joints can be brutal on him some days. His treatments average $25 000 in cost; that's not total  that's per treatment. While he and Amanda have been able to receive some assistance through Medicare  they are struggling mightily to make ends meet and care for their children. They are 2 of the hardest working people I know  but right now neither are able to  and they are in sincere need of any help that can be given. Please  any amount that can be donated is greatly appreciated. Thank you.,7201,25000,10,29,123,1000,5
Rich T Stem Cell Therapy,https://www.gofundme.com/rich-t-stem-cell-therapy,7,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,Hello Friends. Some background; Rich has been diagnosed with lung disease.  A diagnosis severe enough to have been referred for a transplant.  However  the transplant comes with risks and costs that are so very high.  Instead  he has been successfully treated with Stem Cell therapy  clearly extending his life and improving his well-being.  This year he will undergo another therapy  but using a different source of stem cells  and fortunately this will be local so no travel necessary.  This campaign is to seek financial assistance in covering the cost.  This treatment is not covered by insurance  but is millions of dollars less and by far fewer risks.  And he has experienced the rewards  so we are very optimistic.  If you are able and willing  your contribution will be deeply appreciated.  I will provide updates on his recovery.  Thank you all!  :)Melissa Fieck,7085,6500,47,109,76,12,1
Sims Cancer Relief,https://www.gofundme.com/sims-cancer-relief,8,KEMP,TX,My husband Chris  has been diagnosed with colon cancer for a second time and cannot work.  We have tapped out our 401 k and credit cards just to keep up with everything. We have had friends and family help  but they have families to support as well. We are hoping he will be back to work in June and this cancer will be behind us. He gets disability pay but it's no where near enough. We applied for food stamps  but was denied.  Chris is a wonderful husband  father  brother and friend. He is a veteran and has worked all his adult life  so he really hates not being able to support his family. He doesn't like asking anyone for help  just a man thing I guess. But any donations and lots of prayers will be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks                                       April Sims,645,3000,8,22,12,134,4

Dave&apos;s Kidney Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/dave039s-kidney-fund,4,VIRGINIABEACH,VA,As most of you know I am in the final stage of kidney failure and waiting for a transplant.  Luckily for me  my brother is a match  but I live in Virginia and he lives in Connecticut.  So the surgery is very expensive but my insurance will cover most of that.  However it doesn't cover my brother having to travel down here to do all his testing possibly multiple times  and if he is healthy enough to go thru with the surgery missing 2 weeks of work.  So I am trying to raise this money to help him with that  travel exspenses and any other exspenses he might have.  Also some of the money will be used to help me transition from working to short term disability where I wont be making nearly as much money and will have to pay for my medicine and bills while I am out of work for a few months.  Jen and I are very grateful for everyone that has taken the time and effort to help us with our situation. It is a lot  but with your help it would make it just that much easier. We know it's the holidays and things are tight so dont stretch yourself too thin  any little bit helps. We appreciate all the love and support from everyone!,5672,7000,15,81,88,399,5
Help me get my grandfather home,https://www.gofundme.com/helpmegetmygrandfatherhome,0,Montréal,QC,Dear Family and Friends:My name is Andrey. This is the picture of my grandfather  Fernando Gimenez Ferrer. After 60 years of marriage  in February of this year grandmother passed away  and this was one of the biggest life changes for my him. He lost weight and became extremely depressed. I wanted to lift his spirits up and invited him to come to visit me to Montreal  Canada  since my grandfather at that time lived alone in Bogotá  Colombia.From the moment he came to see me  I noticed a decline in his health.  Unfortunately  two months after he arrived in Montreal  I was forced to take Grandfather to the emergency as he became critically ill. He was hospitalized for one week and the costs of his daily stay in the hospital was $700 per night (expenses that no insurance company or travel insurance would cover for a 94 years old man).Soon after  we were told he needed dialysis  and so we started to make arrangements to take him back to Bogota. I made the travel arrangements  from the nearest city that offered a direct flight to Bogota  which was from Newark in the US (about 4 hours away from Montreal). On the way to the airport  he collapsed. I will never forget the terrifying experience of giving him chest compressions on the side of the road while my mother called 911. Since then  he has been hospitalized near Newark  fighting between life and death for about 18 days. After tremendous efforts  although weak  today is he well enough to fly back home. The hospital is asking for his immediate discharge due to the high costs associated with his hospitalization. However  all the costs incurred in this journey  which include flights  hospital visits and transportation expenses have exhausted both his savings and mine.Since he is a 94 years old man  with extremely limited resources  I am asking for your help to raise funds to get him back to Bogota  where he has insurance to get the necessary medical care that he desperately needs. The funds raised will pay for hospital fees  the travel costs to Colombia and the medical care he will receive when he arrives in Colombia. My grandfather  a war veteran always made sure others were taken care of. My only wish is to care for him so that however long he lives  that he does it in a loving and dignifying way. I am not accustomed to asking for money  but this is a desperate time for our family. Any amount helps. If you are not able to donate  I ask that you share this with your friends and family. In advance  thank you for taking the time to read this and for your donation. With love and gratitude                                                      Andrey Gimenez.,2012,3000,19,67,15,50,5
Hope for Dante,https://www.gofundme.com/f8qr7-hope-for-dante,9,TAMPA,FL,My father sustained 4 heart attacks in one month. He is currently on life support fighting for his life. Complications from sepsis  gout and pneumonia caused his vital organs to shut down. After his 3rd heart attack  the doctor’s prognosis was a 1% chance to live. Yet a couple of days later  he was able to draw a house on paper. Home. He wants to go home. He is hoping to go home. Will you help me bring him home? Any amount will help with the surmounting medical bills incurred every day. I know that he will never be the same again after this ordeal. But one thing I know remains  his love for his family as a father  a grandfather  an uncle  a son and a brother.,513,1000,4,51,6,152,5
Mackenzies Third Open Heart Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/lovefortinker,6,RIEGELSVILLE,PA,From our 20 years of friendship  if I was asked to think of an adjective to describe Mackenzie  one of the first words that comes to mind is  strong. Incredibly strong. That may be because she HAD to be. Unfortunately two months after Mackenzie was born  they were told she had the heart defects of Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and truncus. This heart defect is very uncommon but is the same as Jimmy Kimmel's child that was born last year.The lower left and right pumping chambers were not separated which made the red blood cells and blue blood cells mix together. Along with this  her pulmonary vein didn’t extend far enough into the lower pumping chamber due to her lack of a pulmonary valve.During Easter weekend at 4 months old  She underwent her first heart surgery. This surgery was to put a shunt in to make all of the veins on the right side grow big and strong. During this  her lungs collapsed. Shortly after  at 18 months old  she had her first open heart surgery to repair the pulmonary atresia. Again  her lungs collapsed and she was in recovery again. When Mackenzie turned 7 years old  she was faced with another open heart surgery. Her Aortic Valve was leaking. All doctors said she either needed a valve from a pig or a mechanical valve. However  with knowing that her heart will grow too large for that  they continued their search for an alternate form of surgery. This is what lead them to Doctor Richard Jonas. This third surgery was a success and she came home on Mothers Day. As this third surgery occurred in the late nineties  Doctors claimed that humans can live a normal and healthy life without a pulmonary valve. However  now in 2018  studies say the opposite. Mackenzie always lived a healthy and active life. She was always driven and never let her heart condition stand in the way of pursuing her career at Upper Bucks County Vocational Tech School or sports at any age. She now works part time at Hair To Dye For in Easton  Pennsylvania. She loves doing hair and making people feel the true and natural beauty within themselves. As I am writing with love and support from Co-Workers  Family and Friends  Mackenzie will have to undergo her third open heart surgery on November 27th in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. This surgery will be to replace her pulmonary valve with the root of a pigs valve. Her aortic valve which has lasted with a repair for 19 years will now be replaced with a mechanical valve. These surgeries will leave Mackenzie on a blood thinner for the rest of her life. We will be raising money to help Mackenzie out of this difficult time of surgery and being disabled to work. Mackenzie and her boyfriend Alex Noecker have recently bought a house in Williams Township which leaves them with a ton of bills on top of these new skyrocketing medical bills. Any donation you are able to give would be greatly appreciated to help Mackenzie and Alex relieve one aspect of her  now third  open heart surgery.Thank you all so much!-Brynne,2430,15000,12,16,45,269,5

Hope &amp; Vision for Thomas Cuillo,https://www.gofundme.com/hzrfe-help-for-thomas,6,NORTHPORT,NY,On October 2nd  2018 Thomas  an 18 year old boy  was involved in a tragic accident and sustained a ruptured open globe injury that has now left him completely blind. His right eye has been lost (enucleated) and his left eye has optic nerve damage  detached retina and corneal damage. Thomas also has major damage to his right hand  causing loss of bone and  hand function.Thomas spent 8 days in Stony Brook Hospital  at which time he had endured several surgeries that included immediate emergency surgery throughout the night with hopes to save his left eye  unfortunately did not end with positive results. The following day he had hand surgery  pins were placed in hopes to obtain mobility eventually. The next day was the enucleation of his right eye. After his discharge from Stony Brook hospital  he was rushed to New York Eye & Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai  in Manhattan for total reconstructive surgery with the hopes of saving some of his vision . After 8 1/2 hours of surgery  they were able to reattach his  retina to their best possible ability. There were several holes in his retina. Thomas had a donor corneal transplant as well. Unfortunately the optic nerve was damaged  as was the retina  so we can only pray at this point that he regains some eye sight. He is in the  baby stages of his recovery  and only time will tell as to what degree of vision will be regained.Thomas will need several more surgeries at some point. This is only the beginning of a long  hard road ahead for Thomas. At 18 years old  trying to adapt and adjust to the unimaginable realization of a new way of life. This process will require much needed out of pocket expenses  rehabilitation  personal care assistants /escorts  medications  specialists for needed future surgeries  educational  institutions  training/support  sight tools  goods and services to assist and adapt for his best quality of life. In addition  there are other possible options to assist in regaining his vision somewhat  such as e sight glasses  Fedorov restoration therapy(ACS-alternating current stimulation) retinal implant (bionic eye)  and stem cell therapy. Unfortunately during this process health insurance only covers some expenses and the rest is left for his family to figure out for themselves. Some state services had been applied for from the New York State Commission for the blind for basic skills which again takes time for approval. Once again  Thomas needs so much more to learn and adapt to his very challenging new way of life. Thomas's mother has left her employment to care for him on a 24 hours basis  which caused a financial hardship. His family and the people close to him have been supportive  loving and are all heartbroken. We need to continue to expedite his progression of recovery daily and we need your support as well  please help us help Thomas. We cant do it alone and we truly appreciate the love  support and help.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Please say a prayer for our Thomas.,6789,150000,17,5,127,469,6
Optimus&apos; Mast Cell Tumor Surgery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/summers-cancer-relief-fund,6,COCOABEACH,FL,Hi friends and family  as most of you have heard my best friend Optimus has recently been seen at Island Animal Hospital where we discovered he is suffering from a Mast Cell Tumor in a tricky location on the underside of his body. Our options for this type of aggressive tumor are very limited  and we are required to get surgery started on him as soon as possible. I first began offering a service to raise the money to afford his operation  coming in at an estimated $3 500 - I am not one to ask for something in return for nothing - but after multiple people reaching out asking how they can help us  and not in need of photographic services  and under the advisement of my girlfriend and a few close friends  we have decided to make a GoFundMe account to assist in raising the money for his surgery in as simple of a way as we could think of.We have had multiple vet visits already  the next is for his X-rays to see how far the cancer has progressed in his body  and are hoping that a local removal of the tumor will handle it. Sadly  the location of the tumor is extremely tricky  and requires a special surgeon which tends to add a lot of dollar signs to the procedure. If you are feeling compelled to help us out  please feel free to send donations through this GoFundMe account. Anything is appreciated  even if it is just prayers and well wishes. All the love from myself and from Optimus  we thank you for your support!

Oliver Martinez,https://www.gofundme.com/vznr9-medical-expenses-for-oliver,8,ANNANDALE,VA,Hello my name is Jonathan Martinez  I’m doing this fundraiser for my new born nephew Oliver Javier Segovia born in El Salvador October 1st  2018. Our newest member of the family came into this world with a couple of physical complications that are posing issues to his health. Oliver was born with cleft lip and palate; it affects him in his everyday life. The cleft lip is affecting him breathing. It also makes it complicated when feeding him. Everyone in our family want to see Oliver grow into a strong healthy boy. Unlike in the U.S. in El Salvador medical expenses are out of pocket. The cost of his future surgeries will take a large financial toll on our family. Unfortunately we don’t have the economic stability to afford everything on our own  which is why I’ve created this GoFundMe page. I’m asking the for the support of family and friends so that Oliver can one day in the near future live a healthy life. All the money raised will be going to his parents  Ana Martinez Segovia and  Carlos Javier Chavez in order to help with their medical expenses. So please donate and share the link to this page. It’s would really mean the world to our family. Thank you and God bless!,510,10000,10,5,15,119,5
CANCER TREATMENT FUND,https://www.gofundme.com/v7u3ug-help-with-cancer-treatment-costs,1,TAMPA,FL,Our mom Tammy was diagnosed a month ago with stage 1b uterine cancer. After undergoing a complete hysterectomy  it was determined that the cancer had spread to her cervix  and that she has malignant cells in her abdominal cavity. She will need to undergo 6 rounds of chemotherapy  3 rounds of radiation treatments  and a colonoscopy in hopes to rid her body of the cancer. Unfortunately  she does not have health insurance at the moment  and it is imperative that she begin treatment immediately. We have found that it will cost $7000 just to insert the port needed to administer the chemo. For those of you who know our mom  you know that she is an extraordinary human being. She is cheerful  loving  unbelievably strong  and always puts her friends and family before herself.Now  it's time that we send back some of that love and support to her. We want her to be able to focus on beating this  rather than the struggle of being able to afford it. Anything we can do to help surround her with love during this difficult time is of the utmost importance  so if you are able donate  it will be truly appreciated. Anything helps.

Diali Needs Eye Surgery!,https://www.gofundme.com/diali-needs-eye-surgery,6,PITTSBORO,NC,Community - Our beloved kora player  drummer  and amazing father of Ablaye  Diali Keba Cissokho  has been slowly and silently suffering from a worsening cataract in his right eye. He badly needs surgery to remove it and restore his eyesight. This is the only way that he will be able to see!Cataracts are caused by proteins clumping together on the lens of the eye as we age. At the ripe young age of 36  Diali is on the younger side of the age group typically affected by this condition. During cataract surgery  the cloudy lens is replaced by an artificial lens  and eye drops are prescribed to aid the healing process and decrease the risk of infection. Healing will be complete after about 8 weeks. 100% of the funds raised here will go towards the cost of surgery  which is scheduled for January 24th  2019 in Chapel Hill  NC. Diali and the Cissokhos are so grateful for your support! Thank you so much!,4221,6500,15,65,64,288,5

The 1st two chemo's were unsuccessful  in fact the cancer increased during treatment.  He was again hospitalized  for a more aggressive chemo try.  He still was not in remission  but the cancer was down finally. The bone marrow transplant (BMT) doctor felt that there was no other choice but to attempt the transplant. During all this time he was unable to work  and won't be able to work for more months. Money has been tight for the family. I have helped them as much as I can as I am on a fixed income.  He has huge medical bills  plus utility bills that they weren't able to pay fully.  The medical bills need to be paid  to keep him free of cancer  the BMT is expensive.

Home is Where the Heart Heals,https://www.gofundme.com/home-is-where-the-heart-heals,0,EUCLID,OH,At a Glance: I am seeking $5 000 for a house deposit to save my home after my mother’s passing on March 14th  2018. The house is currently in foreclosure and a sheriff’s sale will likely happen in the next two months or less. Under the sheriff’s sale rules  the deposit is 5 000 for homes with selling prices between 10 000 and 100 000  https://sheriff.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_sheriff/en-US/SheriffSaleWarningLetter.pdf  . My home is expected to cost 30 000  or 2/3 of the appraised value. The Details: Last December 7th  2017  my mom was rushed to the hospital with a 104.9 fever. Just hours earlier  my husband drove me from our home to the hospital with my airway 90% closed  a rare autoimmune condition they would later diagnose as Wegeners Granulomatosis. Untreated  this disorder is fatal within five months. I would be released from the hospital within hours  but unfortunately my mom wasn’t so lucky. Over the next three months  she fought each illness she encountered: MRSA  endocarditis  Fascites  and finally sepsis. In March  she succumbed to her tired body and joined my dad in Heaven. The last three months of her life and beyond also took its toll on me. As I began steroids to keep the inflammation down from my own chronic illness  there were periods when you could barely hear my voice  I struggled with intense fatigue and wondered about my own mortality. But I was my mom’s power of attorney; I was her protector. If she ever became unresponsive  I would be her voice with what little voice I had and the strongest knowledge and confidence of her wishes. I fielded many calls from different doctors every other day  reiterating to them that my mom wanted everything done to save her life  including CPR. Unfortunately  she became unresponsive (comatose but with plenty of brain activity) in late December and the doctors doubled down on the pressure not to give my mom CPR (changing her full code status to Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)). Finally  they simply overruled my power of attorney status and forced her to become DNR three separate times  against this Ohio law  http://codes.ohio.gov/oac/3701-62-10v1 . Before the second DNR  they called me to report she was in agony but would refuse her any pain medication until they finally forced the second DNR. She would be discharged to a nursing home and become full code again  but the next time she was hospitalized  they would again pressure me as POA. When I refused to make her DNR  they simply overruled my authority again. She died remaining in DNR status; something she never wanted. If there is any blessing in her passing  CPR would not have helped her survive her final illness.In her healthier times  mom was a philanthropist who didn’t realize she couldn’t afford the amounts she selflessly gave to faith-based  animal  poverty  and human rights charities. Unfortunately  she spent herself into debt and her estate is insolvent. Her only asset is our home we shared with her before she became too ill to stay home. Our home will be sold at sheriff’s sale likely by the end of December 2018. This home has been in our family since I was five years old  moving from inner city Cleveland to the suburb of Euclid in 1989. I am a librarian and love my job  but after my mom’s death and the stress of illness  hospital pressures to overrule my authority and wondering if my mom suffered in unmitigated pain  I fell into a deep depression of complicated grief. I sought out Ohio lawmakers to strengthen consequences to the repeated broken law my mom suffered through. I hope to change the law’s penalties to finally mean something to doctors during a scheduled review of the law in November. I have improved in my depression but have just a couple of months or less to save up $5 000 for the down payment required immediately during the sheriff’s sale. My mom also left behind her beloved three-legged dog Pumpkin and cat Nutsy that we love and care for. If we lose our home   I worry about losing the animals to other homes and would feel a part of my mom being lost to me once again. Thank you for any support in helping my family keep our home and our family together.,290,5000,17,6,5,20,5

Maureen&apos;s  Mayo Medical  Miracle Made Manifest,https://www.gofundme.com/maureen-brickley039s-mayo-clinic-fund,7,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,"Hi  Maureen Brickley here to tell you my story and ask for your help. In May of 1997 (after being ill for 3 years and misdiagnosed)  I was found to have an aggressive form of thyroid cancer. I had 16 operations  5 rounds of treatment   a husband who abandoned me  a painful divorce  a traumatized teenaged daughter and a lot of debt. Cancer changed my life. In addition  I lost 4 friends to cancer while I was treating. I worked 2 jobs for 4 years and rented out a room in my house to pay bills.In 2002 the company I worked for closed because my boss and friend of 10+ years became ill with...you guessed it...cancer. I lost my job. Sadly he eventually died too. So yeah...lucky me! Right? I'm alive. I lived to tell the tale  but the experience had a big price tag. Emotionally  physically  and financialy. My life was simply never the same and my nerves were shot. Many more problems followed...somehow  I kept moving but eventually life didn't seem worth the effort. I got some help.So  what does one due following an emotional collapse? Why one moves to NM.  And why not? Good weather  lots of sun  a fresh start at 50. Welcome to the land of enchantment.  That was seven years ago.About 6 years ago I began experiencing skin rashes  fatigue  photosensitivity  dental and stomach problems. Without changing my diet  I lost 65  pounds as well as every tooth in my head. I was prescribed  19 different medications. Gradually but steadily I became sicker and sicker.  Since then  my condition has deteriorated. I have been treated for Lupus  R.A.  Crohn's disease  Autoimmune urticaria  Chronic UTI's   Parasites  Congestive Heart Failure  Late Stage Lyme's disease  Peripheral neuropathy  Chronic fatigue  Systemic Scleroderma and Pernicious anemia.Due to ongoing  fatigue  joint and muscle pain  extreme skin itch and swelling  cutaneous creeping eruption  bowel and bladder incontinence  muscle spasms and weakness  loss of fine motor skills  my ability to function normally has been compromised. I  have experienced neurological problems  depression (again) and anxiety (all understandable). I've received blood transfusions  chemo therapy  iron infusions and many different medications. I saw a naturopath  changed my diet   got counseling...and really   nothing has had a lasting effect. My life has been a revolving door of doctors who pass me around like a cheese plate at a wine party. They seem unable to reach a consensus. The response of some friends and physicians has been frustrating and disappointing. It has been very expensive...VERY expensive on many levels!. The last 2 years have been a nightmare. My ability to maintain full time employment and a reasonable bank account has been compromised to a degree that I could have never imagined possible. I vacillate between anger and depressed resignation. I've experienced hunger  homelessness and the inability to pay my bills for the first time in my life. Both of my beloved dogs died. Once again I experienced the scorn and judgement of people who don't understand as well as the generosity and kindness of those who have helped sustain me. It's been a humbling experience. I hope that I never forget the lessons I've learned.This past August after being hospitalized 4 times  (18 days total) I lost my job and my apartment. Blood work indicated liver  kidney  autoimmune  hematological and cardiac problems...but no one here in NM has been able to say why.  The  treating physician at Rust Presbyterian Hospital said to me (and I quote) \due to your extensive medical history  abnormal test results and a complicated  multi systemic  disease  I would say you should run  not walk   to the Mayo Clinic .  I tell you this because NM is a poor state and health  care here is  not the best  certainly not what you're used to.  I don't know what is causing your illness and  your condition is very complicated. You would be better served at a facility like Mayo.\""  To add insult to injury  my hair is falling out by the handful.Sadly I am too poor to afford the Mayo Clinic. I lost my health insurance when I lost my job. I am now on Medicaid and  Mayo clinic does not accept NM Medicaid....hence my request for funding.I want my life back. I want to feel better and have the ability to work full time  to fix my transmission  to get an apartment  to pay my bills and to not feel like a needy shit..  I need to work and I HATE to beg.My situation has been humbling and  provided me with a perspective on poverty and what an illness  can do to an educated  middle class  working person  that I would not and could not have ever imagined having.  I'd like to move on. I'd like to get to the point where I can use whatever insight I've gained to assist others. Mostly I would like to get well. I hope you will consider helping  me get to the Mayo Clinic. Please  pass along my story...I need all the help I can get!Thanks  and blessings Maureen Brickley""",1450,9999,15,15,6,27,4
Wheelchair Van for Eli Reeve,https://www.gofundme.com/wheelchair-van-for-eli-reeve,7,GilliestonHeights,NSW,Introduction and Summary Dear Friends  Family  Acquaintances and Kind Strangers We have reached the stage where we must acquire a new  customised wheelchair-accessible vehicle for our son  Elias. We have held off doing so for as long as we can because we simply can’t afford it. This is a very expensive venture that we cannot undertake on our own  and we need your help. We are seeking to raise a total of $110 000 in the next three months. Note that we have already received approximately $45 000 from direct bank transfers  and another $3 000 raised so far by a friend's own fundraising effort for us - bringing the GoFundMe campaign target down to $65 000 - I am happy to privately provide our fundraiser bank account details to people we know and trust personally  if you would prefer to donate that way (please don't be offended if I decline to provide the bank account details if I don't know you sufficiently well!).If you are so inclined  feel free to share this appeal with other people in your network – the kindness of strangers is also welcome. More information is available below if you wish to read it.More about our family and our appealBelow is a great description of our family situation  and the need for a customised wheelchair van.You can also get some insight from this short video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qub8q179Les&feature=youtu.beI run a one-man consulting business  which I started six years ago to provide our family the flexibility it requires to meet Eli’s needs. Those needs are intensive and  as a result  I average only part-time paid hours. Shell cares for Eli full-time. When he is at school  she co-ordinates the many aspects of his care: managing his NDIS Plan  liaising with support workers and therapists  addressing the avalanche of administration that disability invariably produces  and researching and engineering equipment and solutions for Eli’s unique and complex limitations. She doesn’t receive the Carer Payment. So  we get by on a part-time wage in a double income society  and it’s not enough to reasonably afford a wheelchair van.Wheelchair vans typically cost around $80 000; however  we need a highly customised vehicle that will cost in the order of $110 000. The NDIS funds only a portion of the modifications our van would need  and the NDIS will only pay to modify new vehicles. Only certain vehicles are suitable for such modifications  and those that are compatible with the mods we need cost a lot. We get around in a second-hand car; we can’t afford a new car  let alone one that is expensive.Eli is now ten years old. He weighs approximately 35kg and is technically too heavy to lift. Two years ago  Shell injured her back lifting Eli. She narrowly avoided surgery and hasn’t been able to lift him since. I really shouldn’t lift him the multiple times each day and the many awkward ways that I do  but I don’t have a choice. We rent a house and make do in the non-accessible houses available to us. Designing and sourcing appropriate equipment has been a mind-bogglingly laborious process  assisted only by an industry that is notoriously inefficient and inept. As such  we are still getting by without several essential pieces of equipment. In the meantime  I am fast approaching the point where I won’t be able to lift Eli anymore. Without a wheelchair accessible vehicle  this means we will not be able to transport him. Few wheelchair accessible buses operate around Maitland  where we live  and there are few wheelchair accessible taxis. Eli’s already very limited world will shrink further. Equally calamitous  if I injure my back  we will no longer be able to provide our son the care he needs. Contrary to its lofty objectives  the NDIS would not sufficiently backstop our family in this situation.Shell and I are asking to people to donate money towards the purchase cost of a suitable wheelchair accessible vehicle. We are hoping to raise this money in the next three (3) months. Please support us in this  and please give generously. We really need your help. More about EliasFor those of you who don’t know him very well  here is some information about the boy named Elias:Our only child  Eli—as he is commonly known—is a wonderful  intense  earnest  expressive young man. Others describe him as ‘delightful’ and ‘a force.’ There is something about Eli: people are drawn to him. He has the sweetest nature I have encountered in a person.Eli is confident  creative  articulate and full of potential. He has a voracious appetite for knowledge and he is wise beyond his years. He has accepted a highly-coveted position in the Maitland area’s Opportunity Class for gifted Year 5 and 6 students  and he recently competed in the State Finals of the Premier’s Spelling Bee  charming the Premier  Gladys Berejiklian  and landing himself on TV.Eli loves maths and computers. He appreciates all genres of music and has a keen ear. He is interested in history and other cultures. He enjoys drama and telling imaginative stories. He wants to learn as many languages as he can  so we’ve started with Mandarin.Despite his severe disability  Eli has an insatiable zest for life and a deep empathy for others. He has a strong desire to connect with his world and the people in it. He adores a good chat.Eli has a physical disability known as Amyoplasia Multiplex Congenita  a form of Arthrogryposis. It is a congenital (from birth) connective tissue disorder whereby the muscles in the upper and lower limbs fail to form. This results in fixed joint deformities and contracted limbs. Amyoplasia is quite rare  presenting in 1 in 10 000 births. Many medical professionals are unfamiliar with the condition  and we don’t yet understand its cause. Short of a miracle  there is no fix for amyoplasia. It is not degenerative; however  it generally leads to a decline in limb function unless it is closely managed throughout life. Amyoplasia ranges from mild to severe. Eli is severely affected. When he was born  he looked like a pretzel. It was heartbreaking.Eli cannot straighten his knees or flex his hips. This means he cannot walk or sit on the ground or use standard seating. He is confined to a kneeling position  which has implications for every aspect of daily living  such as bathing  dressing  toileting  sleeping... Since birth  Eli has undergone surgeries  endured painful physiotherapy  and worn plaster casts and uncomfortable splints to increase his joint range as much as possible  but as he grows  most of the gains are inevitably lost. Now that he is older  we can only ‘shift’ the limited range he has.Eli can kneel  which allows him to be independently upright  and—amazingly—he can knee-walk  which affords him a degree of mobility. He can walk only on padded surfaces  though  to protect his knees and reduce the risk of head injury in the event he falls.If he trips or loses his balance  Eli cannot use his arms to brace himself or break his fall. Eli has no upper limb function whatsoever. He can’t bend his elbows or raise his arms  and he can’t flex his wrists or move his fingers. He can’t grasp a pencil or hold a spoon  so he relies on a scribe and voice-activated software to complete his school work and is either hand-fed or eats directly from his plate. Not being able to use his arms is terribly restricting for Eli. He is unable to interact with most objects and perform most activities. He would love to build contraptions and write out maths problems and sketch his ideas. Mercifully  he can operate a tablet device  such as an iPad. We place this at his knees and he generates momentum with his torso to swing his arms and position his hands on the screen. It has been eye-opening for us to discover the far-reaching effects a significant function-restricting disability has on a person’s development  opportunities  and lived experience. For example  we only recently appreciated how poorly Eli understood basic physical forces - something a toddler learns first-hand through tactile play  such as building with blocks. In so many instances  Eli is unable to exercise his initiative  explore his surroundings  and receive neural feedback from basic activities we all take for granted.Broadening Eli’s world and keeping his keen mind stimulated is an exhausting  challenging full-time job. This  combined with his physical needs  thoroughly consumes Shell’s and my resources and has essentially emptied our lives of much else. It has also directed us down ever-increasing degrees of circumstantial disadvantage and heightened our exposure to the failings of systems and people. Loss begets loss  we’ve learnt. Sensational and un-stoic as that sounds  this is our life and this is what it takes to care for our son. It is our great privilege to serve our precious boy. We wouldn’t be without him  but—if we could—we would definitely have things another way.,23870,65000,14,37,81,424,5

Jo Will Not Let a Rare Disease Keep Her Down!,https://www.gofundme.com/JOvsBEHCETS,7,ROCHESTER,NY,This is Jo. She's awesome! But she was thought to have a very rare disease called Behçet’s Disease and she needs our help to get the medical treatment that her doctors have advised her to pursue.There are under 20 000 people in the United States with Behçet’s Disease. A disease is classified as rare when there are under 200 000 people affected by it. So  even among rare diseases  Behçet’s is rare! Most local doctors and medical staff have either never heard of Behçet’s  only read about it  or have treated a limited number of patients with it. Jo's rheumatologist suggested that she see a Behçet’s specialist at NYU based on the rarity of the disease  allergies that Jo has to the typical treatment for Behçet’s tried so far  some atypical symptoms that Jo is presenting with and other complicating diagnosis like Sjogren's Syndrome and Small Fiber Neuropathy.PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE BELOW regarding Jo's visit to NYU and being UNDIAGNOSED with Behcet's. Jo became increasingly ill and in pain since she was hospitalized with pancreatitis in April of 2017.  She was bounced from specialist to specialist being given a different answer each time. Never being one to give up and thinking that her illness was due to the pancreatitis  Jo researched the best place to go and ended up at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. She traveled to the Mayo Clinic three times over three months  and twice  her wife Christine joined her. It was quite expensive to travel between two small airports and stay at least a week each time. She didn't tell anyone until recently  but she borrowed from her retirement savings to fund the trips.  She walked away with a diagnosis of copper deficiency.  After months of copper supplementation and 15 five hour infusions  her copper levels normalized  but Jo was sicker and in more pain. Over the past 20 months  she has been diagnosed (and undiagnosed) with a variety of ailments. It's been a grueling journey filled with tests  copays  infusions  copays  doctors visits  copays  medication  copays  pain  frustration  and other life changing family situations that are heartbreaking for Jo to not be able to step in and support. Through Jo’s persistence  relentless pursuit for answers  and belief in herself  she found a wonderful team of physicians right in her hometown of Rochester  NY who figured out her diagnosis of Behçet’s Disease  which is a VERY RARE  relentless and notoriously painful anti-inflammatory vascular disease with no known cure that can affect any and all body systems. For those who know Jo  you won't be surprised that she is willing to turn over every stone to find the right treatment. For those of you who don't  she is an avid runner  political activist  Italian and Spanish teacher  traveler  advocate for social issues and has always been a very busy bee.  But this illness has taken that away from her for the past two years. She's a volunteer and leader  a dependable friend and helper  and a beacon of goodness with a real zest for life. What's not to love? People know that they can count on Jo to always be there to help not only in her actions  but with her words  her kindness  her loyalty and her presence. Besides all the ways that she's wonderful on her own  she is also half of a dynamic duo as the loving wife to the very dedicated Christine. Christine isn't only Jo's #1 fan  she's the thread keeping things together right now  and is Jo's biggest support system. Jo has faced and overcome many challenges in her life which she honored by having this phoenix tattoo placed on her shoulder. What she didn't realize is that the tingling sensation that postponed her getting the tattoo was the start of her most challenging obstacle yet and now she needs our help to rise from the ashes once again. Jo has been working closely with her employer who has shown great compassion and understanding during this time and wants to make sure that everyone understands that she is still employed and covered by her union contract but the copays  hospital stays and travel are taking a financial toll.  It is not surprising that several people have asked how they can help Jo during this time since she has been there for so many in so many ways. This would be an excellent way to show our support. If you are unable to give financially and/or would like to receive updates should there be other opportunities to help  please contact me at JoVsBehcets@gmail.com  with your name and location. Thank you for supporting Jo so she can get back to doing as many of the things that she loves as soon as possible! Jo's Friend (and 5th cousin according to Ancestry DNA!!!) Nikki Papadopoulos,2110,3000,14,70,46,235,4
Shoulder Replacement Recovery Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/qbzx27-emergency-medical-fund,6,LASVEGAS,NV,I humbly request assistance to cover living and medical expenses while I recover from total shoulder replacement surgery due to end-stage OsteoarthritisMy name is Leia  I am usually a very active 55 year old.  My household consists of myself  my 13 year old grandson & our 2 year old Chiweenie  Finnegan. Joey and I  are active in our community  always giving back and volunteering our time when and where we can. I live very modestly  a simple kind of life  Right now I am going through a rather challenging time and I really need some help.I have been having great difficulty with both of my arms for the last year and a half. My range of motion has been rapidly diminishing and the pain is becoming unbearable. After injections and physical therapy  I finally had MRI's of my shoulders.  My diagnosis is end stage (stage 4) Osteoarthritis. You never realize how much you need your arms until you lose the ability to use them the way you are accustomed. I am in immediate need of 2 total shoulder arthroplasties (Total shoulder replacements)  This has been confirmed by several Doctors locally. I have a wonderful surgeon  Dr Liu at  Advanced Orthopedics in Las Vegas  NV. He performs shoulder replacement surgeries on a weekly basis. I have interviewed several of his patients and they are quite happy with their results  so I feel 100% confident in his ability to give me  2 new shoulders. I have also joined  shoulder replacement support groups to help prepare myself. My 1st surgery is scheduled for December 12th  2018 at Southern Hills Hospital. I will be there for 4 days. This will continue in June or July with the second surgery on my left shoulder. I have a long road ahead of me &  I will need to supplement my income as I am now unable to work.  I have medical insurance but it does not cover 100%. My disability payments will cover my rent   I only require assistance with food  basic living and medical expenses until I can return to work. (approximately 6 to 8 weeks)  Basic living expenses are about $200 per week. I live with a 6 foot 13 year old so this will vary. He seems to outgrow everything every time he blinks.  LOLTo cover physical therapy it will be an additional $135.00 a week. To see my doctor  Co pays are $45.00.It will be necessary to take Lyft or Uber if I can't get a ride  as I will not be able to drive for at least 6 weeks.To my fellow Prayer Warriors  I am so thankful for your prayers and support.❤I appreciate your time and attention and I humbly ask that you share this to increase my chances of  raising the money I need to recover without worry. I just don't want to have to decide between buying food and getting physical therapy. I wish you and yours many Blessings and Prosperity for the coming New Year. ❤Below is an actual x-ray of my right shoulder 2 weeks post-op.

Dominique&apos;s Fight with Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/peace-of-mind-of-mother-with-cancer,1,MERAUX,LA,Hello everyone My name is Lorena and I am a registered nurse in the New Orleans area. I have decided to put together this gofundme page in hopes of helping my dear friend and coworker Dominique fight a good fight against her second bout with cancer.  In  March 2016  at age 30 Dominique was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer with lymph node involvement in her left breast. She underwent chemotherapy  surgery  and radiation. In February 2018 Dominique decided to have a prophylactic right mastectomy in hopes of preventing recurrence. Unfortunately  in September of 2018  Dominique was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer to her pelvic bones  sternum  liver  and thoracic spine after she had begun to have pain in her hips. In October of 2018  she received 10 rounds of radiation to relieve the pain. Dominique sought a second opinion at MD Anderson where she will begin treatment on November 26  2018  as part of a clinical trial. For her treatment  Dominique must travel from New Orleans to Houston every Monday and stay 4 days every first and third Monday. She had been given a prognosis of 30 months. Though the prognosis is not what we hoped for  Dominique is not giving up  and neither is her community. Dominique is the most compassionate nurse and courageous mother to her six-year-old son. She deserves a second chance  please help us give her this chance.May God bless you all.- Lorena Villalobos and Lauren Gonzalez,1583,50000,7,3,26,341,5
Nadima,https://www.gofundme.com/nadima-shojaee,1,YUBACITY,CA,It is with my deepest regret to inform you  the reader  and the world of my dear aunt who has been diagnosed with a late stage 4 cancer of the stomach. My aunt Nadima who immigrated here 15 years ago at the young age of 22 as a refugee of the war in Afghanistan and whom is a mother of 3 beautiful boys (aged 13  8  and 4 above) has recently been told by her doctor that she has a late stage of a particular cancer found in the lining of the stomach known as Adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately the earlier onset of this cancer was not detected by neither her nor her medical team and so upon hearing this news  our family has assembled what we can to act on her situation ASAP. Currently living in Yuba City  which is almost 2+ hours away from the rest of us here in the East Bay Area  one of the first tasks we would like to achieve is to relocate her much closer to us so that she may receive the quality care  comfort  and rest she needs in order to aid her recovery as best as possible while our immediate family can assist by taking care of the kids. With 2 registered nurses in the family and 2 CNA's  we believe it would be in her best interest to live in the same city as her immediate family as right now we are very crowded in a 2 bedroom here in Alameda. The total amount we are trying to raise  however  will be covering her medical expenses. The majority of this being the full payment or co-paymenst she will be paying to Stanford Medical as her insurance may or may not cover the costs of receiving such treatment. As of now all we have to work with is a letter of recommendation from Stanford Medical and her doctor on her behalf  and so upon receiving the decision of her insurance we will be adjusting our goal accordingly but for the time being we will assume the majority of the overnight care  medication  and treatment expenses at Stanford to be her own.By creating this fundraising page for her we do not expect any miracles  but only that the empathy of friends  family  peers  and colleagues could make an added difference in my aunt's battle with cancer and allowing her 3 children the comfort of their healthy mother. No donation is too small  and every opportunity taken to simply spread our message via word of mouth  social media  etc. would be greatly appreciated by us all. Thank you for your time and consideration.,7080,25000,31,28,40,54,6

My car insurance isn't covering my car because they're considering it a collision. They are covering a small portion of the $55 000+ medical bills. I have met very little of my health insurance deductible and out-of-pocket  so they won't be covering much  if any  of it either.I'm hoping to raise money to cover my out-of-pocket and a the cost of a used car.I know Christmas is close.

Vehicle/Medical/Financial Issues,https://www.gofundme.com/feasibility-studyglobalpodvillage,7,CHICAGO,IL,I've been doing painting and remodeling for the last 20+ years.  The last couple years have been rough   but a joint project that I was working on in August of 2018 would have put me in a favorable financial position.Unfortunately  not only did that project fall through  the last six months have seen several projects either cancelled or bidded to other firms  my vehicle fall into severe disrepair and  because I'm not currently covered by medical insurance  there are tests that my physician has urged me to get that I cannot afford.In addition to this campaign  I would also be willing to do projects to repay any monies that are acquired.The estimated costs that I have are as follows: Van Repair-         $1 800 Medical Issues-    1 700Financial Issues    4 000I am in need of the funds to resolve these issues in the next 2-3 weeks.,630,7500,32,8,6,7,3
Oral Surgery/New dentures,https://www.gofundme.com/2nt4kk-dental-surgery,6,BUFFALO,NY,Those who know me best  know that I share my burdens with them as we do that among ourselves for support and prayer. They also know I not one to ask for help so  I'm reluctant doing so on an online/social platform.  I am asking my old friends  fellow musicians and Facebook friends for your help. I have been disabled by neurological issues and cervical spine disease for years  but I can still play guitar and do with the Christian Gospel group Straight Path Music Ministries.  We go to skilled nursing/ long term care facilities around Buffalo  NY on Sundays.I've started fund raiser because I need to get new dentures  but I first need oral surgery called an Alveoloplasty - basicallyit's a reshaping of the jaw bone.  The denture I've had hasn't fit right because of misshapen jaw bone  but was tolerable.  Now  because of bone shrinkage  it barely fits at all.After the surgery  two implants will be put into the jaw. Once the bone heals around the implants  two new dentures will be made. Extensive measurements for proper jaw spacing have been taken so the new dentures will be constructed to make the bite natural again.The process isn't going to happen as quickly as I'd like - it will be many months before all is said and done. What will be accomplished is things that have been wrong for some time will be made right. I'll hope to be able to eat in social situations with confidence. My goals are to be able to bite through a sub-sandwich  eat celery and carrot sticks  dip raw broccoli into Ranch  eat chicken wings off the bones  have some bacon with breakfast and to eat other foods I've been unable to.I will appreciate any help you can give to help me reach my goal  every $5 brings it closer.

Rally for The Williams Family,https://www.gofundme.com/get-well-chrystina,9,DEXTER,IA,"I would like to start off by saying \THANK YOU\"" to every single person that has been asking about my sister or has reached out to see if there was anything they could do to help! Here is more information about her situation: October 2016  Chrystina had a total colectomy with end ileostomy. At the age of 30  her entire large intestine was removed because it was not working properly. Her medical team was unsure of why this happened  but felt that this was the best treatment for her ongoing health issues. Since the initial surgery  Chrystina has been in and out of the hospital numerous times with multiple different complications. She has undergone 4 other surgeries and multiple other medical procedures.  Because of the complexity of her case  her care for the last year has been managed in Iowa City at the University of Iowa Hospitals. Most recently  Iowa City has reached out to Mayo in Rochester to collaborate in the management of her care. Her health has continued to be an ongoing problem. Chrystina is now experiencing problems with her small intestine (similar to what was happening with her large intestine). Some of her other organs are not functioning as they should be either. Her liver and kidney enzymes are abnormal. Her thyroid is not functioning properly and her red blood cells and platelets are very low. She is often unable to eat due to pain and her small intestine not working properly  which in turn has caused her to lose more weight.On top of all of her medical issues Chrystina continued to work as she could; unfortunately  in April 2018  she tripped on a carpet square while getting up from her desk at work and fractured her ankle. Because of her ileostomy and malabsorption problems  she is unable to heal like the rest of us… 7 months later and her ankle is still not healed! Even though this is a mild fracture and should have healed on its own  Chrystina is looking at yet another surgical procedure to have a plate and screws placed to re-align the fracture. She has been off work since the beginning of May and they are really starting to feel the repercussions financially. To top it all off  she was let go from her job after filing a workman’s comp claim on her ankle injury. Her medical health on top of her fractured ankle and inability to work have left them in a bind. Most recently  their 14 year old daughter was involved in a serious car accident leaving them with more medical bills  doctor visits  therapy  etc.. I will be candid and say that they are exhausted in every way possible. It’s not always easy asking for help; however   I ask for your help in assisting them to get their “heads above water” so that they can concentrate on getting Chrystina the help she needs. Any and all prayers and donations will be greatly appreciated!!I can do everything through Christ  who gives me STRENGTH -Philippians 4:13HE will Sustain you -Isaiah 46:4 Carry each other's burdens  and in this way you will fulfill the law      of Christ -Galatians 6:2""",730,5000,8,15,12,120,6
Laura&apos;s Medical Costs,https://www.gofundme.com/laura-davis-medical-costs,0,BUCKEYE,AZ,I have had Crohn's Disease  since 2005. For the most part  the disease was managed up until the summer of 2015. Since that time  I have been hospitalized every year and have required expensive medical procedures  treatments  and surgeries to save my life. In the past 3 years  I have had 4 separate hospitalizations and also had very expensive home health care to manage a PICC line and TPN. With these hospitalizations have come what feels like never-ending bills. We have been paying them off very slowly. We have always had health insurance  but even with that  the debt is piling up. Now  I am currently in Mayo Hospital. We have no idea how expensive this hospital stay will be. We have not met our deductible  though this hospital stay will surely meet that. The only thing we do know for sure is that we cannot afford this.We have applied for financial assistance for every bill we have  and we always are denied. We have been paying these bills for years with absolutely no help.Any financial contribution will help. Big or small. We do not have a specific goal in mind  and our debt is certainly bigger than the goal we have listed  but at this point we are beyond grateful for anything.Finances at home have been a struggle. Tyler got a new job  and now his income is 100% commissions. There were marketing issues with his company and for a few months we were barely getting by and have been putting all medical debt on credit cards  so not really getting out of any debt.We do not spend money frivolously. We hardly ever eat out  we buy almost everything second-hand  we go without many things  we work hard to be very self-reliant and responsible. We would never ask for financial donations unless we absolutely knew it would save us from drowning after all we have attempted. After praying and talking  we both agree that we have reached that point and we are ready to humble ourselves and ask for help.,2915,10000,19,29,65,219,5
Papaw&apos;s Liver Powerhouse,https://www.gofundme.com/papaw039s-liver-transplant,9,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,"Luke  Zach  David  and Nik.  We are Papaw's Powerhouse.Early summer of 2018  our papaw (Keith Martin) was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic  or long-term  disease that slowly damages the liver's bile ducts. In patients with PSC  the bile ducts become blocked due to inflammation and scarring or fibrosis. This causes bile to accumulate in the liver  where it gradually damages liver cells and causes cirrhosis  or fibrosis of the liver. As cirrhosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases  the liver slowly loses its ability to function.  The ultimate \cure\"" for PSC is a liver transplant.While PSC advances very slowly and many patients may have the disease for years before symptoms show quick progression  this in not the case for our Papaw.  Along with Papaw's PSC diagnosis he also received a diagnosis of cancer in the common bile duct.  This is not uncommon in people with PSC ; however  it is not usually diagnosed until later in the progression of the disease.  There are many procedures and processes with his treatments including but not limited to radiation and chemo (for the cancer)  many ERCP procedures (stents placed to open the bile ducts) and then ultimately a liver transplant.While our faith is strong and remains at the center of all this  it's anticipated that our Papaw's journey for a new liver will be one of great emotion  length and significant financial cost.  We would be humbled if you could help us support both Mamaw and Papaw as they continue to move forward in this journey.""",2125,10000,5,21,30,580,5
