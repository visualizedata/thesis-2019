# opportunities for data visualization in augmented reality

## 2D vs 3D

### technologies

- ease of use

	- browser/os agnostic

- ease of implementation/replication

	- ar.js

### user perceptions

- engagement/ learning level

	- a/b testing

### humanizing the experience

- will an alternative presentation engage a new audience to topic?

## differences between AR and VR

### data visualization process/options

### use cases for both

- industry adoption

	- opportunities

		- successes

	- challenges

		- failures

### focus on AR

## personalized AR experience

### can't be one size fits all

- user input/gelocation

	- data privacy considerations

## Alternative Case Study: Noise Pollution and it's effects on well being

### noise pollution data: tbd

- 311 noise complaints

	- identify aggregate sets
	- identify worst neghborhoods
	- show trends over time

		- are conditions improving or degrading over time?

- other- nyc open data?

### measured effects of noise pollution on health

- world health and wellbing report

	- indicators for health and well being
	- cross reference with negative effects of noise pollution

### solutions?

## Case study: Visualizing city pollution levels and air quality w/AR

### common health issues

- diseases

	- who's most at risk

- respiratory issues

### contaminants

- density

### air quality index

- by NYC neighborhood/ national?

### indicators

- construction
- factory
- industry
- weather
- nature/allergy

### possible solutions/ways to reduce impact on health (visualize impact)

- already enacted
- upcoming
- new

## data

### health.gov

- most common diseases by region

### epa

- air quality index
