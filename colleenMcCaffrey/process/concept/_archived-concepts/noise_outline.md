### solutions?

## data

### EPA

- 311 noise complaints

	- identify aggregate sets
	- identify worst neghborhoods
	- show trends over time

		- are conditions improving or degrading over time?

	- if not easy to breakdown data by noise type to represent qualitatively, use data for quantitative effects

- noise code

	- indoor
	- outdoor
	- latest updates/ frequency of regulation enforcement

		- data on number of violations in last year?
		- are the noise codes even enforced? At what cost? If only financial penalty, may have little effect on large companies that can afford to pay fines

	- areas it doesn't apply/ or is ignored

### effect congestion tax and change in carshare laws have on noise code violations/updates or were noise code laws used to enforce congestion tax?

- numbers of vehicles each company can have on road is limited
- measured effect increase in vehicle capacity has on certain neighborhood's noise pollution over last few years
- data

	- TLC open data

		- carshare/taxi vehicles increase on road since 2014

			- neighborhoods most effected
			- what other negative effects doe sthis have?
			- how is city combatting it
