This appeal concerns the constitutionality of Illinois' Parental Notice Abortion Act of 1983 (the Act). The district court found that the <a class="underline" href="#waiting_period_hours">twenty-four hour waiting period</a> imposed by Section 4(a) of the Act was unconstitutional because it unduly burdened the <a class="underline" href="#below_age">minor's right</a> to have an abortion in the absence of a compelling state interest. Zbaraz v. Hartigan, 584 F.Supp. 1452, 1458-59 (N.D.Ill.1984). The district court also found that the judicial procedures contained in Section 5 of the Act permitting <a class="underline" href="#parental_notification_required">waiver of notice to the minor's parents</a> were unconstitutional because they failed to assure the expeditious and confidential disposition of the proceedings at the trial level and on appeal. 584 F.Supp. at 1460-62. The district court held that these provisions were not severable from the Act because without them the Act would have little "operative significance," and therefore declared the entire Act unconstitutional. Id. at 1464. Appellants appeal these holdings.</p>

<p>
    We affirm the district court's holding that the twenty-four hour waiting period imposed by Section 4(a) is unconstitutional. We vacate, however, the district court's holding that the provisions relating to the waiting period are not severable, and accordingly we sever those provisions from the Act. We also vacate the district court's holding that the judicial procedures permitting waiver of notification provided for under Section 5 are unconstitutional, but enjoin enforcement of the Act until the Illinois Supreme Court promulgates rules which assure the expeditious and confidential disposition of the waiver of notice proceedings at trial and on appeal.
