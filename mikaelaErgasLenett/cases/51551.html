<p>A St. Louis policy prohibited non-therapeutic abortions in the city's two publicly run hospitals. <br> Did the policy violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? <br><br>No. The Court held that St. Louis could enact a "policy choice" to refuse to provide <a class="underline" href="#medicaid_coverage_provider_patient_decision">publicly financed</a> hospitals for nontherapeutic abortions even though it provided facilities for childbirth. Relying on its reasoning in Maher v. Roe (1977), the Court distinguished between a state interfering with a protected activity and simply encouraging an alternative activity. Since the state did not deny women the right to have an abortion, the law was consistent with the Constitution.
