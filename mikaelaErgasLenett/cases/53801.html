<p>Under Section 2 of a Minnesota statute regulating a minor's access to abortion, <a class="underline" href="#below_age">women under 18 were denied access</a> to the procedure until 48 hours after <a class="underline" href="#parental_notification_required">both their parents had been notified</a>. Exceptions were made in the cases of medical emergencies and women who were victims of parental abuse. Section 6 of the law <a class="underline" href="#judicial_bypass_available">allowed the courts to judicially bypass Section 2 if the young woman could maturely demonstrate that notification would be unwise.</a></p>
<p>Did the Minnesota abortion notification statute unconstitutionally restrict a minor's access to having an abortion?</p>
<p>The Court found Section 2 of the statute unconstitutional because <a class="underline" href="#parental_notification_required">requiring notification of both parents</a>, whether or not both wanted to know or had taken responsibility for raising the child, did not serve a legitimate state interest. The Court favored <a class="underline" href="#parental_notification_required">notification of only one parent</a> and a <a class="underline" href="#waiting_period_hours">48 hour waiting period</a>. The Court upheld Section 6 of the law.</p>
