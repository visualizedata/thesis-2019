Introduction by David Timothy Duval: 
The Asia Pacific is expected to lead the trend towards traffic growth in the next two decades. Airbus’s Global Market Forecast for 2013-2032 predicts a 151% increase in global RPKs (Revenue Passenger Kilometers). Boeing plans to capitalize on the projected GDP growth in the region and increase its 2012 fleet from 5000 assets to 15,000. 2013 edition on the World Tourism Organization Highlights predicts the strongest growth in tourism activities for the region at ~6% per year until 2030. The book discussed effect of the national government policies such as- full open skies policy (as that of US) – that still remains elusive. The region features 2 groups of countries- industrialized and not-so-industrialized that vary when it comes to the core economic congruent hence the future of air service agreements is unclear. Airlines are franchising, forming alliances and their initiating ventures in order to bypass ownership and access restrictions. This has resulted in multiple iterations of their business models and hybrid ownerships (e.g. Jetstar). The book discusses the carrier within carrier concept, feeder services, distribution models etc.

- John Bowen: Discusses special shift in mobility (regional growth) w.r.t. aircraft size. Also, how economic growth in the region has led to better airport infrastructure, new routes, additional frequencies, increased competition.
- Christopher Kissling: despite the substantial changes experienced, aviation in the region is not ‘robust and profitable’
- David Lyon and Graham Francis: the lessons from New Zealand wrt airport ownership- models of public-private ownership provide an interesting insight on development of infrastructure elsewhere in the region.
- Semisi Taumoepeau: outlines what a successful LCC model might look like in the South Pacific region.
- Timothy Vowles and Daneil Mertens: geographic approach to characterizing the Asia Pacific aviation by examining the role of gateways
- Tay Koo and Larry Dwyer: Highlight the obviously tight relationship between tourism and aviation.
- Aaron Schiff: addressed the issue of availability of sustainable and timely data that can effectively act as a barrier to entry on routes. He argues that this conservative approach towards availability of data is potentially a policy issue for many governments
- Hidenobu Matsumoto and Rogier Lieshout: study market share of airports in Japan – useful for government and tourism authorities to track passenger movements and the relative value of air services.
- Yi-Shih Chung and Cheng-Lung Wu: explore route networks through the lens of market access

The book also addressed market access regulations and policy constraints.
