IATA (International Air Transport Association) reported that leisure and business travel by air grew 7% annually from 1980 to 1990. The largest share of passengers is from flights originating in the US, Canada, and Western Europe. Air travel originating from emerging economies in Asia is growing rapidly at an annual rate near 9%. It’s important to understand the factors contributing to low airfares and practice of charging low airfare is common on all routes. Following airline deregulation in 1998, average passenger airfares fell by 33%, number of airline service providers tripled. Legacy carriers introduced hub-to-spoke networks that lead to reduced cost of travel, this, along with continued investment in fuel-efficient aircrafts further contributes to carrier cost-savings. This book contributes to the debate on fares charged by airline carriers by examining pricing behavior- nonlinear and competitive, analysis includes examination of pricing decisions associated with strategic alliance, competition from LCC and fare setting when facing financial distress. This book analyses the non-price characteristics of air transportation business operations by studying frequency of service, passenger safety, availability of aircraft types for different transportation services, geographic distribution of – air transport related noise – by aircraft departures and arrivals.

Following are couple of examples from pricing behavior section:

##### Non-Linear Pricing 
- Tests - whether competition creates a challenge for – legacy carriers – practicing non-linear pricing (passengers are charged different prices for the same flight without cost justification) by using transaction level data - result: Competition from Southwest has an important effect on both level and fare structure of legacy carriers.

- Analysis by focusing on influence of LCC and adoption of internet based ticket sale system by using price data for over 1700 flights on 39 Canadian and trans-border US routes observed in May 2006 – result: there continues to be extensive price discrimination based on date of purchase of ticket and other factors.

Following are couple of examples from non- pricing behavior section:

##### Non-Pricing

- In a research inspired by different business approaches of two major passenger aircraft manufacturers: Boeing and Airbus. Boeing (with growth in point-to-point traffic) opted for the development of mid-sized wide-bodied aircraft. Airbus (with a forecasted growth in hub-to-spoke traffic) argues to manage the traffic with its super jumbo A380 aircraft.

- Analysis on the role of influence of airports (as a platform that airlines and its passengers use to interact) on airline services and passenger demands by using data on US airports. results: airports are two-sided platforms since (airport exploits the indirect network effects between passengers and airlines), what is the appropriate size of the airport that satisfies consumer demand and what are the determinants of airport size and growth? Findings are in-line with the consumer theory suggesting a positive relation with the population income and growth in the area. Also, airports servicing low-cost traffic promote airport growth.
