This book is a revised version of author’s PhD thesis that questions the sustainability of the 1980s and 1990s airline business model in the market crowded by low-cost carriers. The airlines that will rapidly respond to restructure, consolidate and segment the industry will have competitive advantages. How does liberalized European market affect the ‘legacy’ carriers?

The evolution of EU’s aviation is mainly due to - 1. Liberalization process that began during 1990s and new low-cost carriers with a different business model concerning the network organization 2. Exogenous factors such as – terrorism, epidemics, trade globalization and rise of oil prices. The concept of low-cost-carriers originated in USA with Southwest Airlines in 1970s. Their model was copied by an Irish company Ryanair in Europe in 1991, followed by easyJet in 1995.

What are some characteristics common to some of low-cost models?
-  high aircraft utilization – Internet booking – use of secondary airports – minimum cabin crew - lower wage scales – lowers rates of unionization among employees – one class of seating – short ground-turnaround times (the time during which the aircraft must remain parked at the gate)
 - no cargo carried – simple fare structure and price strategies – adoption of strict yield management techniques – e-ticketing – no seat allocation (for faster boarding) – no frills (passengers having to pay for food) – point-to-point services.

Alessandro Centro basically looks into ‘the old industry’ and ‘the new industry’ models. The objective of his study is to analyze the new strategic conduct of the full-service carriers (the ‘legacy’ carriers) in a more liberalized European market in terms of how they have coped with global economic crisis and increased competition with low cost carriers. Part I of the book establishes the ground on which the argument is built by putting light on factors- market deregulations, open skies agreement between EU and US, Airline business models, FSC and LCC, competition, rise in fuel prices, airline network, pricing yield management, alliances, mergers and acquisitions. Part II looks at the RPK, ASK stats from 2000 to 2003, The September 11, 2001 Terror attack, effect of LCC entry on pricing in aviation, Hub-And-Spoke and ‘Point-To-Point’ network systems, arrivals and departure movements per day etc.
