The book addresses the question of proper balancing between the positive effects and the unavoidable negative effects of the transport operations over the short, medium and long term. Sustainable transportation is an acceptable solution to this issue. The air transportation infrastructure includes airports, air traffic control (fixed infrastructure – space and facilities) serving the main users - passengers, freight and aircrafts (mobile infrastructure). Positive effects of boom in air transportation include contribution to globalization of economy, people’s everyday lives, employment within and around the system which ultimately stimulates local and global economy. Negative impacts include air traffic congestion, damages to the environment and people’s health caused by usage/depletion of the non-renewable sources of energy.

Author elaborates the concept of sustainable air transport system using a quantitative approach. This involves performance analysis of the main system components relevant to its sustainability- airlines, airports and air traffic control.

The book describes concepts of sustainable development, sustainable entities, sustainable air transport system. It describes the technical, operational, economic, social, environmental and industrial performances of the core components of the air transport system – airlines, airports, air traffic control.  Dealing with frameworks, principles and prospective methodologies for analysis and assessment of impact of these components on the society and the environment. It states some examples of sustainability from previous research work, illustrating the complexity of dealing with sustainability issues.

The book provides a framework for the analysis of changes , identification of problems, and looking for solutions for future sustainability of the air transport system.
