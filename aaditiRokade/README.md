Visualizing the impact of climate change on flight experience

#### Tag line:
An exploration of domestic travel sector of civil aviation in India

#### Description:
This visualization explores the trends in flight cancellations and passenger complaints for some major airline carriers operating in the civil aviation sector of India's transportation for years 2014-18. These trends are visualizaed based on temperature and rainfall trends(2014-2018) and upcoming holidays(2019). Being a tropical country, India experiences prominent seasons that inflence air travel, specifically, the flight experience.

#### Abstract:
During the first five months of the year 2018, the low-cost carriers in India canceled 1,824 flights, impacting around 108,000 passengers (TOI-PTI JUL 28, 2018), the highest among the domestic airline carriers in India. The government data showed that around 22 million rupees (Rs) were paid as compensation to passengers by the airlines through May 2018. Flight cancellations leave passengers stranded and inconvenienced and airlines are shelling out large amounts of compensation for these issues. Each year, the monsoon is a dreaded period in India, especially when it comes two weeks ahead of schedule. Weather conditions are the main cause of flight cancellations and delays ultimately impairing the passenger experience. This project aims to look into temperature and rainfall patterns for the last five years in order to analyze and establish a correlation with flight cancellations for scheduled domestic airline carriers in India. The insights drawn from the comparative analysis of airline carriers based on cancellation trends against the trends in changing weather can help passengers make informed decisions for a better flight experience.
