MOM1CHAR.01,Performing pianist,"Both of us performers had the same idea of a heavier rubato on each of the 4 eighth notes, but we executed them differently.

MOM1CHAR.02,Performing cellist,"The opening section (first page) was a little bit stuck. There are few phrases didn't have clear direction, and I couldn't really follow the line when I was listening.",M,1,"I would agree partly if they were referring to when the theme returns. I think if the tempo is slower than you're used to, it should challenge the listener to listen for the direction better.",Elaboration,4,The tempo was too slow,Elaboration,both,neg,judgement of interpretation,1,4,1,4,Performing cellist,Performing pianist,Non-performing pianist,diff
MOM1CHAR.03,Non-performing pianist,At this moment the cello crescended to a climatic moment while the piano became softer. It seems that the sound of the piano did not successfully support the cello during one of the most expressive moments. The same occurance happended later as well (see moment 1a),P,5,absolutelly yes,Affirmation,3,"It would be nice if both player could do the same thing. However, I don't think(?) here is the case. The piano right hand dosen't have the possibility to do much. But the left hand chord *???* is the sign of supporting the cello line.",Elaboration,piano,neg,judgement of collaboration,5,3,5,3,Non-performing pianist,Non-performing cellist,Performing cellist,same
MOM1CHAR.04,Non-performing cellist,"In this section (middle section) there is something that doesn't match. The dupples against the triples are not exactly toghether.

MOM1CHAR.11,Class member 7,The dynamic change from pp to f should be bigger,M,4,Again it's the problem of balancing each other.

MOM2CHAR.03,Non-performing pianist,At this  moment the performers successfully passed the thematic material back and forth.

MOM2CHAR.12,Class member 8,This whole transition part could be somewhat more moving and flowing in both parts. The pianist could use the triplets to push and rhythmic flow like an ongoing current and the 8th notes in both parts can be played with less emphasis on each note so that it can sound like a big gesture.,M/P,3,I think the performers were trying to create a more dreamy(?) lay *???* at *???* which I like.,Elaboration,4,,No comment,both,neg,judgement of interpretation,3,4,3,4,Piano,Class member 6,Class member 2,diff
