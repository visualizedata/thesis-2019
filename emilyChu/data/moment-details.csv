MOM1CHAR.01,"Both of us performers had the same idea of a heavier rubato on each of the 4 eighth notes, but we executed them differently. The first and second notes of the last set of 4 were not together in comparison to the 3rd and 4th.",67,3,68,2,1,0,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.02,"The opening section (first page) was a little bit stuck. There are few phrases didn't have clear direction, and I couldn't really follow the line when I was listening.",1,1,10,2,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.03,At this moment the cello crescended to a climatic moment while the piano became softer. It seems that the sound of the piano did not successfully support the cello during one of the most expressive moments. The same occurance happended later as well (see moment 1a),17,3,17,4,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.04,"In this section (middle section) there is something that doesn't match. The dupples against the triples are not exactly togheter. In addition to that the cello line is too uch ""flat"": I think it should be with more variations of sound and tempo.",27,2,35,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.05,"That's the first real ""f"" moment in this piece. But in the recording, I couldn't really hear the big differences.",17,3,17,4,1,?,?,no,no
MOM1CHAR.06,Beginning - very beautiful. Setting the correct mood for the piece.,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,no,no
MOM1CHAR.07,1:00 min - the cello leaves us unresolved to be perfectly resolved by the piano's left hand. Impeccable timing.,20,4,21,1,1,1,1,yes,no
MOM1CHAR.08,"fp 's on right hand in the piano are bit striking, might be better to do fp in the context of moving toward.",1,3,1,4,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.09,00:28 - tension between two is different (and direction),8,3,9,1,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.10,Cellist and pianist are not together,21,4,22,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.11,The dynamic change from pp to f should be bigger,62,1,62,2,1,1,1,no,no
MOM1CHAR.12,"Every time this rhythmic pattern of 2 against 3 appears, it lacks a feeling of rhythmic urgency. The duple rhythm could be played more like it interrupt and with a little more  tenuto (expressive emphasis).",13,1,13,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM1CHAR.13,"I feel the LH Fp chords, which are first introduced in bar 10, need to be just as committed to emotionally and brought out as much as the RH when it has this marking.",10,4,12,4,0,1,0,yes,no
MOM1CHAR.14,"Every mark ""1"", I feel like they ended the phrase with a little rit. I really like that dispose.",6,1,6,2,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.01,The tempo felt slower and dragged more than the beginning.,37,1,38,2,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.02,"The triplet in the piano part is too much in the tempo, especially at the 2nd line of the 2nd page. I prefer having more flexibility rather than playing like metronome.",20,4,23,1,0,0,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.03,At this  moment the performers successfully passed the thematic material back and forth. The attention was pulled from cello to piano and back to the cello before going towards the final forte on page 2.,29,1,35,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.04,"Here there is the first real FORTE, but the piano is missing a bit this dynamic, especially the left hand with the chord should be lauder.",17,3,17,4,0,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.05,"That's the repetition of the moment 1, but it sounded more open and intense. But I'm not sure if I feel more expressive on that spot or he played differently than moment 1.",53,3,53,4,1,?,?,no,no
MOM2CHAR.06,Page 4: recap of the melodic theme. Sounds a little bit dull. I wish I could hear a different statement about it.,37,3,37,4,1,1,1,no,no
MOM2CHAR.07,1:17 - 1:19 - the cello's descending thirds (duples) are counter balanced beautifully with the righthand piano (triplets) answers lyrically yet rhythmically.,27,1,28,2,1,0,1,yes,no
MOM2CHAR.08,"★ marking spots on score --> could be intepreted as (duple eighth notes) not (triple eighth notes) in Schumann's works. And (triangle) marking spots on score, cello parts are sighing sound is beautiful.",12       13,3          2,14      14 ,1          1   ,0          1,0          0,1          0,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.09,"1:24 - piano, beautifully accompanied, overall there are places where piano overplay/sing the cello.",29,1,29,4,0,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.10,The inner voice is too loud in the piano part,50,2,51,4,0,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.11,"I like how this f wasn't too aggressive, but more lyrical, it was given a buoyancy that made it soar.",17,3,17,4,1,1,1,no,no
MOM2CHAR.12,This whole transition part could be somewhat more moving and flowing in both parts. The pianist could use the triplets to push and rhythmic flow like an ongoing current and the 8th notes in both parts can be played with less emphasis on each note so that it can sound like a big gesture.,28,4,35,1,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM2CHAR.13,"In bars 29-35, I want greater difference in dynamic level between the three musical parts: the melody the cello, the countermelody in the RH, and the murmering triplets in LH of the piano.",28,4,35,4,1,1,1,yes,no
MOM2CHAR.14,"mark ""2"", I really like the pianist changed the charater when the music changed to another color.",29,1,29,2,0,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.01,The relationship between the cello eighth notes and the melodic right hand of the piano could have been cleaner rhythmically speaking.,26,3,28,4,1,0,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.02,"I really like the *???* climax in the measure. Both ensemble working and individual play are satisfying to me when I listened to it, especially the little stretch(?) we did in the middle of the bar.",45,1,46,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.03,"Similar to moment one, the sound of the piano did not maych the expressive intent of the cello. It seems the cello craved a true arrival while the piano wished to back away to the chord.",61,1,61,2,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.04,Too much RALLENTANDO! They don't cut the sound together in the last note. The cello finishes before the piano.,63,2,69,4,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.05,"for me, I think this spot should be most expressice moment of the piece, but it wasn't special enough",62,1,62,4,?,?,?,no,no
MOM3CHAR.06,"Page 5: ending: cellist is playing beautifull, but I wish the pianost would have played softer, really pp so it would feel like dying (or falling asleep).",58,1,69,1,1,1,1,no,no
MOM3CHAR.07,"1:51 - 2:16 - the recap in the cello is more subtle yet more confident and projected, leaving the listener feel like there is hope and not all fate.",37,4,46,3,1,0,0,yes,no
MOM3CHAR.08,(parenthesis marking) part of last pages sounds dragging cuz of the too many rubatos. Might better idea to wait not to be slower too soon till next of (parenthesis marking) section.,53,1,58,3,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.09,"2:15~ - piano, singing but more balance with the cello especially when it's octaves",46,2,47,3,0,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.10,ensemble not together,67,1,67,4,1,0,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.11,Need to linger more on this downbeat to make the surprise harmony more apparent,57,1,57,2,1,1,1,no,no
MOM3CHAR.12,"In both places, the third beat, where it's marked Fp in one place and F in the other, lacks this painful emotion. It sounded like taking it for granted. One could perhaps use a little more time, while still listening to the note already played, and use more sound to bring out more emotion that can resolve later.",55,3,55,4,1,1,1,yes,yes
MOM3CHAR.13,"I want more inflectional variety between the repetitive figures in bars 65-69. I sense a ""floating away"" quality in dynamics here, but I want the pulse to stretch even more with each additional statement of the melodic fragments.",65,2,69,1,1,0,1,yes,no
MOM3CHAR.14,"mark 3, I think the cellist could play that section like a little bit hurry, just like the cello want to say something with the pianist at the same time.",13,2,13,3,1,0,0,yes,yes
