## Project Abstract
Notes on Perspective experiments with making visually tangible and beautiful the thoughts and feelings that occured during a musical performance. It is a single page application (SPA) with three states. Each state visually experiments with binding data to an abstraction of embodied experience: 1) situatedness, 2) activity and 3) perception.
